review_359881,shopping,"i lived in san luis obispo for a few months and they have one of the best weekly, outdoor farmers markets i've ever been to (in the U.S. anyway)....and not counting the Dekalb Farmers Market in Atlanta. the SLO market had tons of vendors, bands, performers, tons of food, arts/crafts, everything. so of course, i compare everything else to that. \n\nbut the old town market is pretty cool. they have a great selection of organic veggies and they are absolutely beautiful. so colorful and fresh, and full of flavor. we only buy a couple of things, but it's just fun to be out and about with the dog and enjoying our great weather. \n\nsome of the other vendors there...the goat cheese, desserts, and organic salmon are, i'm sure, good, but way too expensive for our budget. unfortunately, you can't run a household and still afford to buy salmon at 20 bucks a pound. \n\nall the same, nice place to walk around a buy a carrot or two. plus, you can always browse the touristy shops of old town, which i always like to do.",3
review_439535,shopping,"I've been to this Dee's Donuts a few times and every time I've been there it has been very pleasant. The ladies there always throw in a few doughnut holes in when I purchase two or three individuals. Not a huge selection of donuts at this place,  but I will say it is 1000 times better than going to Dunkin' Donuts. If you are in the NW area and craving something sweet and fast go here! They will always hook you up!",3
review_497702,shopping,"Favorite store hands down! Had to return something,no problem. They even helped select replacement. Better selection of shoes in Las Vegas store than in New York store. Too bad the store is so hidden away.",4

review_603189,shopping,"Picked up three NY STrips for Mothers' Day dinner.  It was excellent quality meat and a very reasonable price for such quality.  I'm giving it the full five stars because when I asked the owner if he knows what \""city chicken\"" is, he did, and said \""every good butcher should know what city chicken is!\""  I heartily agree.  Support your local businesses, and get great quality while you're doing so.  Visit the Butcher Block!",4
review_240523,shopping,"One of the cleanest TJ Maxx stores I've been in. I was there during a blowout sale, but they managed to keep some semblance of order, and the staff was really helpful.  Checkout was speedy despite the massive amount of people.",2
review_10772,shopping,"I kind of hate shopping at this place. I am not handy whatsoever (!!!) and usually can only be dragged here to look at plants. \n\nSo I went there a few days ago looking for shelf brackets. I had a picture in my phone, just in case. I asked a person, who asked another person, who showed me some but then saw the picture in my phone and showed me some different ones. None of them looked close enough (I HATE returning stuff), so I said 'forget this'. \n\nThen I went to look at plants. I found a lovely vining plant marked from $19.98 to $6.00. Of course it rang up at $12.98 or so. I explained to the friendly young man working the garden center register, who called for assistance. That individual walked over to see the plant in question and snottily pointed to the price tag. The kid at the register told him it was wrong and where to look (based on my description) for the $6.00 sign. He found it, it was adjusted, and I went home with my plant. \n\nThe plant is gorgeous, otherwise I'd be pretty tempted to give them 3 stars. \n\n(Oh, and I found the correct brackets at a local hardware store when an old man working there saw me wandering around and chased me down to help me. SERVICE.)",2
review_551857,shopping,"I have to say that I really didn't like the sales associate who help me it seemed as though I was a waste of her time. l'm from California and stopped by on a recent trip I was not impressed to say the least. She was not helpful at all and I was willing to put down some $. It's funny how the Glendale CA store was very attentive. l left with not a whole lot in my bag. The only thing good that came out of this experience, was the fact that I got a rewards card and I can use it @ home. The end! P.S. l love Bare Minerals brand and this one experience will in no way change that.",1
review_574754,shopping,I love the organic meats and vegetables here and they have a great sale on the organic meats also.   This staff is always friendly here I like it all around,2
review_3765,shopping,"I'll be the first to admit that I'm a little weary of shopping at thrift stores. The clothes always smell like they have been in the attic or someone's basement. The store washes the clothing but you can sometimes smell the faint scent of cigarettes. Not all the clothes are bad though.\n\nI like to shop for the high end shirts and pants. They tend to have a lot of items and the prices are out of this world. They have a lot of clothes are are still new with the tags on them and every thing. I recently purchased 6 shirts, 3 pairs of pants, a winter jacket and a Paula Dean sauce pan and 2 purses for only $55. These are nice clothes too, not cheap t-shirts with holes or stains on them.  I always take the clothes home and wash/sanitize them first before I wear them. \n\nThey have more than just clothes too. There are silverware, pots and pans, dishes, halloween costumes, shoes, baby items and even furniture and electronics. The only down side to this store is that there is no dressing room. So the only real thing you can try on are coats and shoes. I see people trying shirts and pants on over there clothes sometimes but it proves rather difficult unless they are men. My sisters tho did wear leggings to the store so they could try on the dress pants. They bought designer brands like BCBG, Black house|White market, Arden B, claibourne, Van Hausen, and lots more!!!\n\nThis stores prices are beyond great, almost everyday they have a special. On saturday it was half off all color tags except red. I found so many items $4 pairs of pants, $3 shirts, $7 jackets. The Paula Dean pot was only $4 as well and that was great coming from a thrift shop. \n\nIf your ever interested in shopping here it's best to go on a Wednesday or Saturday early!! Wednesday you get half off your bill if you bring a senior with you. I like to use grandma sometimes to get some cheaper clothes. She enjoys it as well so that she can buy all the little nick nacks and holiday items. Happy shopping!!",3
review_55860,shopping,"As a FLorida transplant, I would compare Smith's to Publix Supermarkets. They are above average quality and maintain clean supermarkets. The staff are always pleasant and polite.\n\nThe three-star rating for this store stems mainly from the lack of selection (with certain products like yogurt) compared to the nearby Smith's on Sunset.",2
review_607703,shopping,Amazing shop!  Husband and wife owners that do everything they can to make the customer happy. Every time I go on there they are amazing.  I have sent all of my friends there and they are all extremely pleased with their experience,4
review_51365,shopping,One of the few stores in Phoenix that still carry Jello sugar free Vanilla pudding cups in the dairy case. We love the stuff and it makes a great easy dessert with whip cream and a little chocolate syrup drizzled on. (Have to have the sugar free so you can have the whipped cream).   :),2
review_147001,shopping,"The old store was rather pathetic looking. However, ever since moving towards the front, the store is now gorgeous and ever more enticing - dangerous for my wallet.\n\nThe staff are incredibly friendly - almost painfully so. Within a few feet, you will get barraged by at least three sales associate asking if you're doing alright. But the sales...those monstrosities are dangerous. Usually they have a 50% off handbags deal or an additional discount off clearance. Great savings, but sad day for my debit card.",3
review_233254,shopping,"Love this place. It is really large for sprouts,bigger than some of the others i have been to.  Lots of parking in the open Parking lot.                                                                 A really good location RIght on Indian School Road and 28th St.  Vitamens, herbals, lots of natural products. Great meat and fish dept. Lots of fresh fruit  and veg. Very simalar to Sunflower or Whole foods, and the price is right in the middle. Another good thing. .5cents off your bill for each bag you bring in. Yeah!",4
review_221766,shopping,Nice store with lots of cool but overpriced things. I went in with a couple of friends on Saturday and finally left after I became tired of being followed around like a common thief. I'm sure the owners could show a little more respect for customers and let them shop in peace. It's not like I'm going to walk out with a 50 lb piece of iron.,0
review_145697,shopping,Nice big place. Everything under one roof. I love it when they have their sales. My only problem is they send me a coupon but I cannot use it for the things i want because the higher end products cannot be included in their coupon (. Why bother sending .,3
review_281031,shopping,"Bargain for those who look 2nd hand clothes. Not my deal but couple of friends that I took here were pleased with prices.\n\nI brought some clothes to see what will happen and the feed back was .... missing!! I took clothes I hardly ever used and compared to some pieces they have I really don't get it what is that they want. Anyway, some girls go crazy in here. BTW if you hate the new nike shoes you got, bring them here, they'll give you more than 10$.",2
review_113576,shopping,"One of my favorite places to go shopping. A lot cheaper than the mall, better quality clothes, and everything you get is original and unique. I don't have to worry about someone else ever wearing the same thing as me! It always an exciting and interesting trip, and my friends are always jealous of the great finds I come home with.",3
review_254875,shopping,Cute store with cute clothes. They had a lot of items on sale - good stuff like Rich & Skinny jeans to pretty blouses. Good range of price points. Nothing that I couldn't live without - but a place that I'd stop in every so often to see what they've got.,2
review_17535,shopping,"With its remodeling, this Walgreens has undergone a strange and wonderful transformation that is probably best viewed at 11 p.m. on the night before a major holiday. I may have to go back on Christmas Eve to confirm this hypothesis.\n\nThe deal here is that drugstores, convenience stores, dollar stores, grocery stores, and discount department stores (Target, Walmart) all want each other's business and are gradually transforming into one another. So this Walgreens is sort of a baby Walmart: smaller! cuter! friendlier! oh-so-adorbs! let's chuck it under its sweet dimpled chin and buy lots of seasonal candy!\n\nWhile rival CVS has gone the route of wide aisles with cheerful-yet-strangely-useless signage, Walgreens is packing the merchandise in. The experience is much more like the drugstores I remember fondly as a child: narrow aisles, tons o' stuff, and you never know what you'll find. It has gone hogwild for minor convenience electronics -- the stuff like car adapters and chargers where it's a pain to figure out what store even to try. Also: walls of Ferro Rocher! \n\nThere may be a real niche here for \""what I want is too specialized for QT or Circle K to carry it, but if I have to face Walmart or the grocery store or the mall, I'm gonna cry\"" shoppers. Keep an eye out for the house brands that are now being featured prominently (nice!, de-lish, savings with a smile), as the pricing on these can be really, really good. \n\nIn a sensible move, this Walgreens has recognized that people who are buying cat litter, batteries, lipstick, cold medication, bourbon, and orange juice at 4 a.m. are not people in any shape to figure out how to queue. The cash registers are approached by a cattle run built from candy and small-electronics displays, and as a person who's recently endured the Camelback/16th CVS's Queue of Mass Confusion, I am grateful that there is no ambiguity about where to line up and who's next.\n\nI want to see what happens with the displays when Christmas is no longer dominant before I get too giddy, but this store looks to have become a lot of fun.",3

review_253974,shopping,"This is a nice, small local shop that carries some high quality dog food. The have frozen, raw dog food, too. \n\nThey have some real fancy clothes for tiny dogs. I bought some awesome hiking shoes for my larger sized dogs here a few years ago- Ruffwear. \n\nThe location is very convenient if you live in the Cave Creek area. It's near Safeway and Target, so it's easy to combine shopping trips. \n\nParking is usually available close to the store, although for a huge parking lot it often has surprisingly few open spaces!",4
review_644164,shopping,One star for the shopping. This place needs a new owner and a new staff. Incredibly rude and not customer friendly. I'm sorry did I interrupt your social hour?,0
review_433068,shopping,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE Sheplers. \n\nI think I may be a boot snob but when I came to Arizona I went to THREE different boot stores before I came to Sheplers. Apparently the boots I was looking for are rare. I actually came here on a whim and the first thing I asked them was \""Do you have any leather/wood bottom boots.\"" And I didn't even have to explain why I needed it they steered me to Corral boots. Now, Corrals and I do not mix well so I asked for any other boots.\n\n And guess what? They showed me these Ariats that had leather bottoms!!! Apparently when I'm trying on boots you can tell whether or not they are comfy by the face I make. And apparently I made a very happy face when I tried on these boots. All I had to do was put these boots on and I knew they were the ones for me. Walking in I thought I was going to spend at least $300 on boots. I ended up spending $250 on boots and other things.\n\nThe staff was super nice and even told me how to get to Toby Keith's. If I ended up living in Arizona because this is where all the red necks are and they are super nice. I felt I was among my people! Good Job Sheplers. You have awesome employees and my feet are very happy while I'm at work :)",4
review_253696,shopping,"Turn on the A.C!!! Wow, we went to look for a sofa here and it seemed cooler outside at 100 degrees. Needless to say we give it 3 stars because we weren't able to view as much product as we would have liked. We liked the selection, but way too hot in there to spend the time to see everything.",2
review_88788,shopping,"I got lied to by a GPS purchase, I was promised it had free lifetime map updates but it turns out, it does not.  The customer service desk people were nice and understanding but the manager that was brought over was extremely rude and dismissive.  I could not return the gps or was offered anything to rectify me spending too much money on the gps.  I will never come back here and everytime Shopko is brought up I will share this story.",0
review_603785,shopping,"I love the lounging options scattered throughout the mall, the live music was a nice touch, and the mister fans are dreamy, but the store selections were less than impressive. I enjoyed my time there, but I think it had more to do with the fact that it was opening weekend and I had gift cards and other goodies handed to me more than anything else. \n\nThat said, I'm not a big time brand junkie and upscale shops don't tend to wow me. I'm sure there are many who will really appreciate this place. Like the countless people who waited in a humongous line for who knows how long just to get into the Coach store. I bet they loved it.  Me? I might go back for Wetzels Pretzels and a nice misty outdoor stroll, but that's about it.",2
review_428705,shopping,This review is solely based on their market section. This place has a legitimate halal butcher shop section. This is hard to come by in this city. The meats are tasty if you want better ground beef let them grind you a piece of meat. They are friendly and work hard.I am so happy I found them. I wish they had better selection of rice and the produce section was better marked. Overall pretty good,4
review_504,shopping,nice and clean with well organized large selection but was expensive. I was looking for some twin size thin cotton blankets easy to wash and hang dry for my dog and the prices were $14.99 of course somewere high quality items which u would have to pay new retail store price $40-50 but still overpriced. I finally found a small blanket for $7 on sale.,2
review_148720,shopping,"The one star refers to Sales Associate, Michelle.  I requested alterations for an ankle length pant that was a bit too long.  Michelle was sent to the dressing rooms to assist with this and immediately projected a negative attitude and rude tone.  Instead of assisting politely and patiently to determine the length of the pant, she asked another customer if she needed help.  I had to wait for her to finish with the other customer.  She insisted that she couldn't assist with determining the length of the pant, due to my socks being on.  She did inform me that the pant came in a short length and that she'd have to make a call.  After making the call, she informed me that indeed the pants come in a short length, in all colors.  I stated that I wouldn't be able to try them on and she abruptly shouted \""they fit the same\""!  When I voiced my concern with the manager, she informed me that they don't actually fit the same; the short length is a bit shorter in the rise.  Without saying a word about my thoughts of Michelle, my daughter said \""She's an angry elf\"".  Michelle's tone and attitude was not the same with the other customer.  She showed her patience and a calm demeanor.  Maybe this Michelle is prejudice towards Japanese women.",0
review_252153,shopping,"2.5 Stars\n\nThis is a barebones middle of the road Walmart, not the best or worst I've been in. You'll see a interesting mix of customers here, some that deserve to have their pics posted on that website all about Walmart customers.  My house is in between this Walmart and another one.  This parking lot at this store usually returns less door dings than the other Walmart by me.  I shop here for my non-food items.",1
review_558502,shopping,"I'm not a fan of the Walmart chain and typically choose not to support them- but sometimes, visits are necessary. Stopped in for some emergency cat food after a late night Yelp event nearby, and was pleasantly surprised by the friendly staff, clean and organized layout, fresh produce, and good prices.\n\nLately I've noticed an increase in cat food prices, and for the small size bag I can expect to spend $6 for nearly every brand unless I have a coupon or a sale price. Luckily, the $4 prices I usually expect were still in effect here, so I scooped up two bags.\n\nSwung by the meat department and noticed several orange \""manager special\"" stickers on discounted turkey items (spicy sausage and Jennie O ground), which was reminiscent of Albertsons and Sprouts' meat department sales.\n\nManagement was an active presence in the store, moving throughout and discussing planned product placement changes with staff, who were good about asking if I needed help locating anything.",2
review_349902,shopping,"I don't want to sound un-PC, but this ABC store isn't in the, uhh, greatest neighborhood, so be careful if you're headed here late at night or when it's dark out. Lots of unsavory characters hang around in here, and I've definitely seen some uncomfortable situations and confrontations go down there.\n\nWith that said, great place to pick up any and alcohol you might need--and I do mean ANY alcohol. Their selection is tremendous. And the people who work there are really nice as well, which is a nice touch. Honestly, this place has whatever you need for your party, down to the mixers. \n\nJust be safe when you're headed here.",2

review_455252,shopping,"With about as much ethnic diversity in store as you'd find in the Nuremburg rallies, Jack Wills is the clothing you wear if you feel the need to proclaim to the world 'I am a complete, and utter, cock'.\n\nAlso it's expensive.",0
review_27856,shopping,"I always want to like this place but I just can't. I'm fine with paying a bit more for great customer service, but the prices are significantly higher and often the customer service is no-where to be found. It is hard to navigate this store and my experience is that finding someone to help you is often as difficult as finding what you are looking for, if not more so. Another problem is with what the store calls \""seasonal items.\"" In other words, be prepared for the possibility that whatever you buy will not be returnable, even if it is unopened and unused. I have found that Ace does have a different / larger selection than Home Depot or Lowe's on certain specialty items (for example, signs and doggie doors). But I still begin with Home Depot or Lowe's first and visit Ace only as a last resort.",1
review_519738,shopping,"This is the kind of thrift store where you go in hope of finding something amazing, and either you do, or you leave empty-handed. It's about 2/3 housewares (including furniture) and 1/3 clothes.\n\nThe stock is distinctly curated, not the randomness of the Goodwill down the block, so cut glass and crystal are heavier on the shelves than random glassware of randomness. If you're interested in vintage clothing but not up for \""vintage\"" or Buffalo Exchange prices, you may luck out here -- I did.",3
review_552342,shopping,"Made the mistake of coming here on opening day.  Not a good idea for someone with anxiety issues.  They had a bunch of really good deals, but I fear it is probably going to be the same as going to Walmart.  And I HATE going to walmart.",1
review_363456,shopping,I only gave 3 stars since it took forever to navigate through the store but I wanted to give a shout out to my cashier Tameika. She was super friendly!,2
review_323382,shopping,"In a world where we don't have a Whole Foods (yet?), I am thankful we have Healthy Home Market. They have everything that a standard healthy, organic market could have but with reasonable prices. They have a HUGE selection of kombucha to choose from along with a pretty sweet selection of beers and protein powders. Like others have said, I pass on buying produce there since the prices are a little jacked up but the prices for fresh meat arent bad at all. They have a smoothie and sandwich bar where you can get it made right there along with prepared meals to take home with you. And they have bulk bins with a wide variety of oats, nuts, grains, etc which are super cheap---two thumbs up!",3
review_414955,shopping,"Love this store! Great stuff from classic to classy, reto and redone, vintage, collectable and antique, there is an amazing collection of things in this shop!  I also appreciate the focus on reuse, reduce and recycle! \n\nThis is a must visit for the vintage shopper!",4
review_496573,shopping,We LOVE the new store!!  Everyone really knows their Oils!  The quality is the best around and shopping there is always a treat!  They did a great job moving to a larger location and often cook a little so we can taste more of the product on food.  \nThe Blood Orange EVOO and Cinnamon Pear Balsamic are my two favorite flavors along with Basil EVOO.  I just cannot get enough of them.    Please indulge yourselves and stop by for a visit.  Great Christmas presents!!!,4
review_37741,shopping,"I have lived at T.J.Maxx since it first opened. Shopped there so much I even bought stock in the Company. Why not? But as far as customer service. This place is awful. I would love to do the hiring if only allowed. This is not just a service thing. This is a management thing. Ever since I can remember they have had the worst managers I have ever experienced. T.J. Maxx is in some serious need of a makeover in the mgnt training dept. Also when I have complained to corporate I have never in many years, ever received a response. I have since sold my stock and have cut my shopping here by more than 50%. And I mean, shopping. I was a junkie. I'm not sure I can ever cut it off completely because I can avoid the staff. But if I am any indication of how others are treated, their sales must be way off.",1
review_554710,shopping,"Basically Hobby Lobby is if a craft store had a baby with a home decor store. I went here because I need all to see my options of stuff for my DIY wedding projects. \n\nI found a few stems of paper leaves that were cool and a list of stuff that were possibilities if I didn't find something cheaper. Don't forget your coupons! I feel that the prices of certain things are a bit high and the 40% off one item coupon helps take it down to a acceptable level. There was a geometric shape table knick knack I thought was modern cool, but the sticker of $70 for a damn thing made out of thin metal rods is ridiculous. \n\nThis is the spot though for painting supplies as their prices are better than most shops, for beads, for silk florals and if youre into all those signs with quotes and words, they are everywhere in the store.",2

We got them from someone else.\""  \n\nShe then got on the phone to someone who told her they would be getting a delivery during this week.  I guess I'm not coming back.  Why guess when they'll have something when I can just buy it elsewhere.\n\nI did buy a cannoli for $4.  It's a bit pricey but it was larger than the miniature ones you see at casino buffets.

review_317243,shopping,"My review is mainly for Earthfare's lunch and dinner fare! While I'm aware they have a whole lovely store filled with pricier organic eats and stellar cheese, I spend my time in the cafe area. \n\nWhether you love the hot bar, the cold salad bar/noodle bar, paninis, pizza or prepared grill eats - there's probably something for everyone. One of my favorite lunch deals (I learned from Ms. Faith D) is the $5 soup, half wrap and chip deal. Deeeeeelish. If you're feelin' the Italian, you can also score a piece of 'za in place of the half wrap to round out that $5 lunch special, too. \n\nThe staff here are always really friendly and helpful, which makes for a very pleasant lunch experience. Don't forget to sign up for Earthfare's deals online - they often send out specials, coupons and whatnot that can really add up over time. Oh, and if you ever see the oriental noodles in the cold bar, please leave them for me - they're my fave.",3

This was a little on the smaller side and less clean than most of the Michaels we go to.  We were searching for a particular type of scrapbooking paper that my wife uses in her paper crafting. As with the other locations, we really didn't find any. They all seem to be out of stock of this particular paper. In addition, the paper section needed some straightening. There were lots of pages in the wrong spot, and the paper we were looking for had the slots filled with different colored papers. That may be why the stock ran out and was overlooked.",2

review_476943,shopping,"I absolutely HATE this Walmart!!!!   The only reason that I come here is to try to pick up an item here or there since it's on my way home from work.  However, several times I've come out empty handed because they are miraculously sold out of what ever I wanted.   The management here is horrible since they can't seem to keep their shelves properly stocked.  Who is in charge of ordering?   It all boils down to the manager not running a tight ship.  If this only happened occasionally, it would be one thing, but every time that I'm there?  Also, the service desk needs additional help. One time when I went to pick up an online \""ship to store\"" item, just one clerk was working the returns desk - and he had a line.   He told me to go to the photo area and someone would be there. So after waiting and waiting - I checked the print-out of my order confirmation, got the store phone number, and CALLED the mgr from my cell phone - having seen his picture & name on a plaque on the wall.    Lucky for him, a clerk finally showed up before he answered.  I will go to the store in Indian Trail, NC (1'st choice) or the Arboretum at Pineville-Matthews & Providence Rds. (2'nd choice.) They seem to be managed much better, and rarely do they not have what I'm looking for.  Enter this Walmart at your own risk - but understand that you have a big chance that whatever you went for is out of stock.   Read (and believe!) the others' reviews about this store not being properly stocked.",0
review_356473,shopping,"I think the 3 star sort of summarises this shopping centre/food court/tourist attraction. It's pretty average.\n\nThey have some brilliant shops down here - Topshop, French Connection and Warehouse, but the whole place just feels so sad. There is no atmosphere and there is no sense of enjoyment. On paper, Ocean Terminal should be a tourist paradise and attract heaps of Edinburgh locals but in reality it just isn't doing it!! They have a VUE cinema here which is brilliant, I've been a few times because it's always really quiet and there's free parking (woohoo!) so it's a winner all round. The food courts aren't brilliant, there is a nice view of the docks from some of them, but I definitely wouldn't go out of my way to come here.\n\nSaying that, the John Lewis and other shops are worth visiting if you have a purpose.

review_439682,shopping,"Unlike alot of Mexican grocery stores this one is uncluttered , wide aisles. There is a little food court with some good looking food. There is a huge grill cooking some chix, el pollo loco style. Then u come to the tortilla section were they are making it fresh. First time I've seen nopales (cactus) tortillas. The meat section is very clean , I don't usually buy marinated meat but it looked so good and fresh , I thought it would go with the fresh tortillas , salsa and guacamole we had in the cart . They also have a cheese counter with all kinds of Mexico 's finest. They even had fresh made rice pudding they sell by the lb.  The bakery was impressive, everything looked so good . We picked up some reg flan for my mom who's flying in tonight. I say regular because they have a flan that is on chocolate cake , first for me . Taste pretty good . Too bad or maybe it's a good  thing it's a good drive from my house, cause this is one market I would love to go to every week . If u like to cook or eat Mexican food this place is for u .",4

review_535402,shopping,"I honestly felt like a kid in a candy store here. The selection of spices, herbs, and other items are too good to pass up.\n\nFirst of all, it smells AMAZING inside of this store. And the staff is very friendly and helpful. As I browsed, one of the employees let me know that there are taster bottles throughout the shelves which you can take a little sample out of and taste it. And if you still have a little bit in your hand, they said it's fine to just drop it on the floor. Which probably why it smells so great inside.\n\nI went to Savory Spice Shop with the intention of just getting cardamom and saffron but ended up buying other things too. Besides the obvious herbs and spices, they also have gourmet food items from local artisans, teas, unique spice blends, books, mortars and pestles, cedar planks for grilling, spice racks, and salt blocks.\n\nI really can't wait to go back again and just admire all the wonderful things this store has to offer.",4

review_345274,shopping,"What? What did you say Chezelle? You want me to come in? Ok, sure, just a brief visit. \n\nChezelle's cute cocktail dresses and silk tops just beckoned me to stop in, so I did! This well-appointed boutique is nestled in the Shops at Morrison, providing some neighborly love to Charlotte big hitters like Scout & Molly's, Capitol and Earthfare. When I walked in I was greeted by a large tabled filled with stunning accessories - rings, bracelets, necklace, cuffs, you name it - they had it. I was even happier to find out that most of these accessories were fairly affordable! I would venture to say that a fair amount of their costume jewelry fell into the $30-$75 price range.\n\nAs for their clothing, Chezelle lines up some great, unique designers that you won't necessarily find in other boutiques. I spied brands like Mara Hoffman, Lauren Moffat, Cynthia Steffe, Amanda Upchard, Cynthia Vincent and Rory Beca, just to name a few. While Chezelle seems to run sales fairly often, the non-sale retail price can squeeze your credit card: $100-$250 for tops and $150-$400 for cocktail dresses. Regardless, Chezelle has a myriad of beautiful clothing and jewelry that will satisfy a variety of tastes. I will note that I wasn't the biggest fan of the store layout, as I didn't quite know where to start. The clothes aren't organized by color or necessarily by style - but maybe it was the time of day when I dropped in.\n\nWhen I popped in here on a Saturday afternoon it was pretty busy and I didn't get much interaction from the staff, which was just fine by me. They were friendly when needed yet also gave me time to take in the store and check out the merchandise. I'll be back Chezelle!",3

Bigger selection of glasses, more staff, different desks for different requirements. The staff were really friendly and efficient too.

While it sits on a rather large piece of real estate, my boyfriend & I weren't completely blown away by the offerings.  For a hot Memorial-Day-weekend-Saturday, by 2 PM, there wasn't much activity happening, even though they're open until 6 PM. I have to agree with Will, the whole separate shelter deal is rather odd. There seemed to be more customers than vendors.\n\nWe were happy with what we did pick up, which was some ears of corn (already shucked & de-silked), strawberries, & peaches - all from different vendors.  We ate some today (Sunday) & everything was perfect - no imperfections whatsoever - as in no bruising, etc. with the peaches & strawberries.\n\nOther notes: plenty of parking, a greenery shed with trees & plants, a \""craft barn\"", & a few carnival/festival type vendors for a quick bite.

Still I cannot deny their quality and selection.  This time, I was after pillows.\n\nSo picked out the kind of pillow I wanted, but I couldn't find the style I wanted (back/stomach vs side sleeper).  I didn't see anyone I could ask wandering around, so I went up to the cashiers.  The young lady was probably one of the perkiest persons in customer service.  That interaction in and of itself brightened my day, but the result was that the pillow only came in one style.  She couldn't leave her post to help me, but promised to send someone who knew more than her anyway.\n\nNow for my second surprise in customer service.  Now when a young man shows up, I only expect a knowledgeable background if we are concerning ourselves with electronics, sports, cars, etc.  Definitely not pillows.  Well I don't mind being proven wrong especially in such a pleasant manner.  Turns out some time ago the store had some returned pillows due for disposal (I was also glad to hear used pillows don't make their way back into circulation).  Instead of just throwing them out into the trash, he did a little exploratory surgery.  He found out all the differences there were to correlate with price.  Add the fact he was more than happy to share, I was impressed.\n\nIt's almost a shame this team isn't running the place the whole time, but that just wouldn't be fair.

review_245463,shopping,"Not a good experience here today! I went in to return some items and the woman helping me was somewhat rude and not helpful. Usually when I go in I'm in and out and have no issues. This woman was being very technical saying that the skew number on the receipt had to match the item exactly, even though it was the same item. For example, I returned a creme brulee set and the skew number on the receipt ended in 4686 but on the item it was 4687. She would not allow me to return the item even though it showed I bought a creme brulee set. I think she figured that I would just take the items back and not worry about the returns. In the long run it wound up making more work for herself because she had to do some of the returns over 2 or 3 times. Maybe she was mad because I had 8 different returns? I don't know. If you hate your job that much to where you take it out on customers then get a new job! It makes me mad because even though I was returning about $200 worth of merchandise I spend well over $1,000 there this holiday season. I could easily take my business to TJ Maxx or Marshalls. They charge a little more but at least I wouldn't have to deal with snippy little brats. \n\nAt the end of the transaction I thanked her and she ignored me and went onto helping the next customer.

Don't carry the largest selection of brands either, wouldn't buy brand name coffee here that's for sure.  They do have some good good prices, their bulk items are very reasonable, not sure about the quality though.  This place is not for me, would hope they can update anything gluten free to make shopping easier as well.",0

review_212353,shopping,"I'm not a big fan of this place, although I was only here once for lunch.\n\nParking here can be a bit tight, but the interior of this bagel shop is fairly spacious.  Somehow, the atmosphere on the particular afternoon I visited stressed me out.  A family with two screaming kids, spilling things on the floor.  The employees appeared to be squabbling over something or other and loudly calling out ingredients that they needed.  The layout is also a bit confusing with menus on one end, payment on the other that was opposite to guest traffic.  The staff on this day was a bit surly.\n\nI did like the open, industrial vibe with writing on the walls and a variety of news magazine covers on the walls.\n\nThe lunch bagels have fun names and neat meat and veggie combinations.  I had a turkey, avocado, bacon and cheese bagel.  Steamed bagels are a strange concept for me.  I'm not a fan.  Bagels packed To Go will steam on their own in the wrapper, so why steam them to start?  All in all, I guess I like my bagels toasted and to eat them in a relaxing environment.  It's a matter of preference.",2

Bought $30 worth of cars and since the store ran out of the free car, they gave me another similar car for free.  Great customer service here!

review_68711,shopping,"I visited wal-mart to get a dresser, after trying to lift the box I realized it was too heavy for me and so began the nightmare of customer service. I wondered the aisles looking for an associate but could not find one in furniture so I went to electronics and again no associate, I went back to furniture and found an associate but she did not respond to me the 3 times I said \""excuse me\"" to get her attention. Frustrated,  I went back to electronics and found another associate who was kind enough to page for help. I waited and waited and waited. 15 minutes later there was still no help in sight. Another associate walked by so I asked her to page for help, she did. Another associate walked by her and said \""I can't lift it\"" with attitude and walked off. I watched as 4 female employees talked about how they couldn't help me instead of actually walking to find someone who could. 10 more minutes passed so I walked out. No sale. \n\nSadly, my fiance had gone before Christmas to get me the same dresser and had the exact same experience.  I brushed it off thinking it must have just been busy since it was Christmas time but clearly, this walmart just has awful service.  It is bad enough that it is always dirty and unorganized, add awful service and this place becomes the last place I will spend my money. \n\nKudos to the two people who actually new how to do their job, it is just too bad there was no follow through with the others.",0

review_237265,shopping,"Great location, terrible customer service. I know Forever21 isn't really known much for their customer service, but the associate I asked for very minimal help (to help me find two pairs of shorts I was trying to exchange) was incredibly rude about it. \n\nI had asked another associate (at the register) if I could get some help finding them. She asked an associate who had walked up to the register. She rolled her eyes and walked over to me. When I asked her where the shorts was, she told me they were \""uh, right there\"" on a rack next to me .... where they weren't. While I asked her about another pair, she looked incredibly impatient and annoyed that I had asked her another question. \n\nI have been working in customer service (both fashion and other types of retail) for six years. Again, I know customer service isn't #1 in Forever21's list of importance in their stores, but I don't think it's necessary to be impatient and rude when a customer asks for two quick questions. \n\nI have had great experiences with customer service at the Scottsdale Fashion Square location, as well as a better selection (even though it's a smaller store).

review_571694,shopping,"I'm somewhere between 3 and for stars on this location, as it depends on really who's working and what time of day it is.  Overall, I really like this Circle K, and like coming here for a variety of stuff, but sometimes, and I do mean sometimes, I walk out slightly irritated. Other times I leave, and I love it here. It's not bad, just sometimes more frustrating then others.\n\nOn the good side, this place is large, clean, well kept with a variety of items to choose from.  Loads of drinks, a clean, well stocked store, clean gas pumps, friendly staff, donuts, coffee, and a handful of other gas station items as well.  This is what keeps me coming back for more, and it's usually easy in easy out at this place.\n\nSometimes, I get irritated because the line can be a bit long, and I seem to catch a rush here from time to time.  I don't have a problem with the rush, but sometimes, depending on who's working, the lines move faster then others.  Some of the attendants are faster then others, and if you catch it on a slow day, it can be frustrating when you have other things to do.\n\nAlso, you can use your Fry's card here for $$ off gas if you hit a 100 points or more from shopping there. That's awesome since sometimes I do, and who doesn't like to save money on gas prices these days? Love that they work together on that, yet another reason you'll find me here getting a variety of different items, not just gas.\n\nOverall, aside from the speed of some of the attendants, I enjoy shopping here.

I also noticed a few rather pretty tea dresses but none of the material looked that good quality and I can't imagine many of the items lasting more than a few washes! \n\nIf the items here were cheaper then I could see the appeal, especially for teens and younger girls as many of the items are very glitzy with diamantes strewn on them but it doesn't seem to want to be aimed at that target audience as the prices are around \u00a330 for bags and dresses and I don't know many teens who can afford to pay that.",1

I called after the three month period was up. They said that my dress was still in China and that it was delayed due to a natural disaster. What a joke!! When it finally arrived, I went to pick it up. This brainless wonders they have working there said we still owed the other half of the amount. That was wrong. We were able to prove that. This was all in August. I thought the horror was over until three days ago I looked at my bank account and they had debited over 400 dollars from my account. Never received notice that this might happen. I went to confront them and was greeted by even more stupidity. I guess they don't keep records on site and they have some imaginary accountant that never comes to work that is supposed to be figuring this out. I wasn't getting any communication back until I finally got a hold of someone and threatened with a lawsuit and filing fraud charges with the police.

review_204722,shopping,"I've been a loyal ikea fan for years so it pains me to write them a bad review.\n\nI recently remodeled my new home and came to ikea for flooring and kitchen cabinets.  I went in to purchase the flooring first but apparently their flooring is being eliminated. They did have one pallet left of the flooring I wanted but I couldn't find it so I asked for help.  I was unimpressed by their searching methods.  Looking in the same place that I already looked and confirming it's not there isn't helpful.\n\nAbout the same time I went to purchase my cabinets, ikea comes out with a new commercial that's aimed at clueless people who want a new kitchen, so I went in to buy my cabinets with confidence and measurements in hand.  I walked to the kitchen department and waited for an employee to finish up on the computer. I told him I was there to buy cabinets and he asked me if I knew which ones I wanted, I said I didn't so he hands me a booklet and tells me to pick them out and he'll put the order in for me.  I said \""don't you guys do this for me\"" and he said \""you have to pick out the cabinets.\""\n\nGreat.  I left and grabbed a glass of that lingadong juice from the restaurant and started figuring out measurements and hurting my head with thoughts of angles and door openings.  When I finished, I headed back to the department to give the guy my list and I saw a couple sitting at the computer with a different Ikea employee and they were living the commercial!  My heart sank.  Why were those jerks getting their entire kitchen designed on cool software and I had to pick mine out of some black and white catalog- 1950's style.  My money is just as green as theirs!  As the guy started entering my order and asking me questions about toe kicks and countertops, my blood started to boil and I let the guy have it for not giving me the same service as the other customers there.  His attitude quickly changed and he became helpful.  At first he had told me to grab the sink drains and cabinet handles on my way out but after our chat, he went and got them for me.\n\nWhen I went to pay for my order they told me it had to be picked up the same day, not ideal but okay.  I called my contractor and he said he'd be there in a few hours.  I'm pretty sure I'm the first customer to ever buy cabinets but have someone else pick them up because they have no system in place for that.  I had to beg the guy at the counter to help me out but he wouldn't.  So I decide to return the next day when Harry and I can go together.  We come back the next day, I hand the cashier my order to pay and she tells me that they are out of everything. \n\nMe: really? You're out of every single cabinet that's on my order?\n\nIKEA cashier: yes, really.\n\nMe: In one day you sold out of all these cabinets?That doesn't make sense, these cabinets are on 3 different displays upstairs. This sink has been sold here for years. How can you be out?\n\nIKEA cashier: I don't know, but we're out.  Go talk to \""pick-up\"" about ordering more.\n\nMe: pick up? Really? Okay \n\nThe pick up guy tells me to talk to \""returns\""\nand returns tells me that because the order was placed yesterday, it's coming up as not available. He fixes it and finally I'm able to purchase the kitchen but not before growing contempt for my favorite home store.\n\nLastly, I get a call from my frustrated contractor because the directions are telling him to drill holes into the cabinet face but there are no marks where to make the holes. I tell him no way, ikea instructions are faultless.

review_72739,shopping,"What is it with women and purses--well my wife anyway.  I finally bit the bullet and said I'd take her to Burlington today--no Coach for her.  Burlington usually has something that will fill the bill, but there's a lot of looking and looking and well you get it.  Today atypical.  Within 20 minutes, she found the perfect purse--for this year anyway. \n\nAs usual, things in Burlington were messy.  Things were all over the place.  I guess there are so many people rummaging through that they just don't have nor take the time to replace stock the way a normal outlet would.\n\nThen came checkout.  It's akin to enhanced interrogation.  You wonder if you're in the correct lane.  You bob and weave to move to another lane that then stops moving.  It's a nightmare.\n\nI really would like to give the place more than 2 stars but any visit to Burlington is not OK in my book.",1
review_419216,shopping,"Very clean store. Staff could be a little more friendly. They are very chatty with each other and I get the \""blank stare\"" if I ask a question because I interrupted their conversation (after waiting 5 mins for them to finish it up). Sale prices are great! Regular prices, not so much. If you shop from their weekly ad, you can save a ton of money. Be careful when buying food from the deli. We bought mac and cheese and found hair in it. They were great about the refund though. All in all, it's a nice store.",2
review_265172,shopping,"The previous season collections are in my opinion a definite step down for la perla not worth the price tag , but the reason I'm giving the store one star is the mindblowing incompetence of the sales stuff member that I was dealing with. \n\nI have been wearing la perla for years. On a recent trip to Las Vegas, I took the opportunity to visit the store. I was greeted by a good looking youngish lady with a foreign accent. She asked me what size I was, and I wasnt sure, since I lost a little weight. She took a look at me and said:\""you're 36\"".\n I said: \""well, I usually wear 34 or 32,\"" referring to my agent provocateur and eres bras, respectively.  I wear 32 in la perla.\nShe said, unphased: \""Our bras run smaller than others in america.\"" HUH? First red flag. La Perla is known to run large compared to other high end lingerie.\n\nIt did go down hill from there. The sales assistent came across as rude and condescending.  I tried a whole bunch of ill fitting bras that we're not appealing to me, even though I clearly communicated my preferences and fit issues, of which the sales assistent was blissfully oblivious. \nIt appeared that I knew more about their merchandise than she did. Finally, I asked to see a specific bra. As she put a size 38 band around my 28 inch ribcage, she tighetened the straps. I pointed out that they're digging rather severely, and she said (and I quote):\n\n\""YOU GET SUPPORT EITHER FROM THE BAND OR THE STRAPS\""\n\nPerhaps there are women out there who are not aware that putting too much pressure on the straps causes severe neck and back pain, contributes to headaches and can even lead to damage of an important nerve. But coming from a person selling bras, this is simply atrocious.\n\nAt this price point, one would expect well trained, knowledgeable staff. \nA sales assistant whose only attributes are a sleek hairstyle and foreign accent just doesnt cut it.",0

review_552355,shopping,"I came here again for groceries with my teenage daughter this weekend since I received a $10 off of a $50 purchase coupon in the mail.  (Yes!)  It's a bit of a drive for me to get up here since I live nearer downtown Phoenix, but I think it's worth the drive if I go once a month or so.\n\nFirstly, I'll begin this review with perhaps my ONLY criticism of the store and that is that there isn't an apparent plastic bag recycling box at the front of the store like there are at so many other grocery stores.  I just assumed there would be one and was caught off guard when I walked up there with my used bags and I couldn't find one.  Oh well...  \n\nSo, anyway I was once again, dazzled by the enormous selection of various goods.  Their selection in each department (including bulk goods) is so big that it's like a grocery store on steroids. And once again the prices were fabulous.\n\nAlso, a new thing for me this time was the presence of some very friendly employees stationed around the store offering samples of the different goods that the store had on sale that day.  My daughter and I sampled their whole wheat French bread and a garlic butter spread, a new type of cold cereal from Post, some toasted flat bread, some crab cakes, and finally some Progresso brand clam chowder.   It was nice.  \n\nThe checkout process was efficient and the cashier was friendly and fast.  He applied my $10 off of $50 coupon, then he asked me how many of my own bags I had brought so that he could credit my grocery bill for it.  I don't know exactly how much credit you get for each reusable bag, but it's still awesome.  My daughter bagged our groceries and before I knew it we were ready to leave.  (And you say child labor like it's a bad thing...)  \n\nWe got out of there with a cart STUFFED to the brim with fresh produce, tons of meat, four gallons of milk and a dozen yogurts, several loaves of bread, plus a bunch of name brand grocery items (including two big bags of cat and dog food) for just about $120.  In comparison, I estimate I would have spent about $150 for all that food at a competing grocery store. \n\nScore!",4
review_302411,shopping,"I hate this Wal Mart. It's so ghetto. You can tell when people get their government assistance because you are more prone to see carts FULL of groceries at that time. Not that it is a problem who receives what, but the environment of this Wal Mart sucks. I live the closest to this Wal Mart though so I must deal. Most of the time I go to Target but there are times where I used to come here. EVERY TIME I used to come someone asked me in the parking lot if I wanted to buy tamales. Like EVERY TIME! It annoyed the shit out of me because I would usually be coming out with my items. So obviously I wouldn't want your tamales when I am sure if I wanted some I could get them from a restaurant or maybe even from inside. Another thing is people standing at the front one particular guy says he is an \""aspiring\"" artist and when I ignored him as I was walking out he played the race card saying we are both African American and we should support each other. Wal Mart shouldn't allow people to be soliciting outside the store UNLESS they are selling girl scout cookies.\n\nI did love to get my watermelon from here though it's cheap huge and super sweet! \n\nAll Wal Marts are not created equal...

review_272440,shopping,"This is Undefeated. Vegas style! If you have been to an Undefeated chapter store in Los Angeles, this store is pretty similar. I think it looks exactly like the Silverlake shop. The layout is very simple. Left side is kicks, right side is apparel.\n\nShoe-wise, they have the typical Nike-Jordan Urban account, but occasionally they will have some limited stuff that will sell out quick. Adidas, Puma, Reebok, and other brands are also sold here. It is slightly better than the Nike Store in Caesar's Palace, in terms of classic Nike sneakers. The selection isn't the best, but they have all of the current Urban account styles. \n\nTheir collaborations and store goods are the main draw. A lot of casual customers get their sweaters, tees, and hats with their store logo. I saw their nice BAPE collaboration, but the items ran over $80 for shirts and hats. Typical BAPE-overcharging. They have a lot of sneaker accessories, such as cleaning items, laces with lace locks, and even a Mag-lite in case you want to club someone to death for stealing your sneakers.\n\nThe people who work here are nice, but I expect that out of all of the chapter stores. They run things quite differently at Undefeated. It is good for a non-intimidating experience.",3

And now, I'll be making regular trips.  \n\nThis Market was established in 1908, though there are folks claiming to have pictures showing it was running back in the 1800's too.  It's still in it's original building, with the paint fading softly all around the edges of the building.  Just as in the old tradition, they try to be a general market - but for a new generation.  \n\nThis is what is on their business card, \""Baked goods, groceries, produce, beer, wine & beverages.  Antiques, collectibles and furniture from the Old West & Mexico. Saddles, tack, spurs...oh, and of course, coffee\"".  When I was there last, we left with a sack of homemade chipotle rolls, homemade granola, ice cream, 2 home grown organic avocados - and about an hour of entertainment for my mom as she ooo'd and aahh'd over the antique bookshelves holding stuff like Hormel chili in one row and stacks of wine in another.  \n\nThe flyer she gave my mom - who was oh so obviously new to the place, showed pastries, dog treats and deserts are coming soon.  Of course, the girl working the counter is the daughter of the family that's owned it for the last 30 years or so.  And she told me their semi-long term plans are to turn their \""back room\"" that currently holds the antiques into a restaurant.  \n\nThis place is like no other spot I've ever been in Phoenix.

review_43471,shopping,"We bought a large sectional sofa from Creative Leather earlier this year. The sales staff was very helpful and knowledgeable about various leather selections/options and the size of our space and the sofa that best fit. As this ended up being more of a custom selection, I was worried about the manufacturing timeframe to meet the date of a large gathering at our house. The sofa was built and ready as promised and the delivery guys hit the delivery window of time as scheduled. Matter of fact they were meticulous, laying cover on floors and corner protectors so as not to mark up walls. We had an overall great experience dealing with this company. It is not everyday you buy furniture (or at least a sofa), so we took the time to shop and view multiple places. When the time comes we will be back here to buy again. Until then, we will enjoy this well made, comfortable sofa.",4
review_43160,shopping,"My daughter, granddaughter and I shopped at your Kierland store about 30 minutes ago. It was a shopping experience much below our expectations of J Crew. \n1) The wait time to check out was atrociously long\n2) My daughter was approached by a male employee who asked her if she needed any help. When she asked a question his response was \""I don't know but I will find out when I get a chance\"". WHAT? Why would you offer to help when you are unable to help?\n3) We bought 3 items. After exiting the store we discovered that the one of the items had not been reduced by the 40 percent off. Went back in and the wait started all over again. Apparently the discount did not apply to the item in question. The employee missed the opportunity to make a recovery by not offering to apply the discount anyway ( a grand amount of $12.80). Are you kidding me? You spend millions on marketing and then miss an opportunity like this to make a favorable impression. \nMickey you are a great merchant.

There has been an excessive amount of turnover there, even places that seem like they should be stable. Case in point, the magical disappearing-reappearing-and disappearing again Banana Republic. Maybe it keeps things... fresh? It's kind of schizo place over all anyway, with its mix of high end (Saks) with not so much (Victoria's Secret).

review_67723,shopping,"I'm actually happy with the sectional sofa I bought and the price I paid for it.  I was pleased with my in-store experience as well.  My experience with delivery far outweighs any of that however.\n\nThe store has a good amount of inventory and has items for most budgets.  Maybe not super top-end stuff, but plenty of low and mid-range furniture.  I wasn't hassled.  An employee asked me what I was looking for; he showed me some options and then he gave me space.\n\nI wasn't sure if the couch would fit in my space and I was advised to go ahead and purchase the extra piece and simply decline receiving it during delivery if I no longer wanted it.  Sounded simple....\n\nI picked a Saturday for delivery.  As always, these sort of things have a 4 hour delivery window.  But they wouldn't tell me what my 4 hour window was until Saturday morning.  As they were setting it up, they realized that one of the pieces I ordered was missing. I signed for the pieces I received and signed declining the extra piece I decided I didn't want.\n\nThey scheduled to re-deliver the final piece on the following Monday.  They brought the piece, and also tried to deliver some of the pieces I already had.  The employee was very forceful when trying to connect the delivered piece to the rest of the set.  I'm surprised it didn't break.  Once they left I noticed after all their forceful slamming, it wasn't even connected fully.  I connected it myself with ease.\n\nI waited a week for my money to be credited back for the piece I didn't receive.  It didn't come.  I called the store and they said they would \""start processing now\"" and that it could take up to 10 business days.

review_232805,shopping,"Nice, big, well-lit parking lot.  Good neighborhood that I feel safe shopping later at night in.  Carries basically everything you would want as far as basics go, plus a few extras.  Minus one star for narrow aisles and some digital coupon hiccups.\n\nTheir prices can be higher than other grocery stores (though I hear Albertson's is worse), but only if you don't use their card AND jump through the hoops of their digital coupons on their app.  Once you download all the coupons (no limit), then the prices go down to reasonable-to-excellent depending on what deals you have.  Some speciality items (like mochi ice cream and organic goods) will still be more expensive than Trader Joe's or Whole Foods. \n\nTheir private label quality is pretty good, especially the Eating Right, Safeway Select, and Open Nature brands.  The lower-end generics will have a few annoying qualities that show why they're cheaper (the Lucerne cheese slices don't have paper behind them separating the slices like Sargento does).\n\nI also find this store to be better stocked on some items than the Fry's on Camelback and 20th street, which will run low on items when they're on sale (Greek yogurt seems to always be out of stock there - thank goodness Costco carries a plain Kirkland one now).\n\nThe employees for the most part show good customer service.  I've had a few very friendly and helpful encounters too.  Sometimes the person manning the self-checkout area is a little \""zombie-ish\"" though.\n\nThe in-store Starbucks, Wells Fargo, and Pharmacy are all convenient and their hours aren't too limited.  The pharmacy staff is polite and helpful.\n\nOverall, a nice upper-middle market supermarket that I will continue to frequent.  If they made a better effort to carry more local items (the Safeways in Hawaii do a good job there) it would be appreciated.",3

So, the next day, I drove back to WF, fully expecting to have to beg and plead my case for an exchange.\n\nThey didn't even ask a question! The friendly customer service person went and found a replacement, and he removed several bottles that were due to expire soon from the shelf as well.  No paperwork, no forms, no questions - just a straight replacement. Wow!!\n\nFor the rest of the store:\nButcher and seafood selections are overpriced; seafood often smells and tastes a bit old/fishy.  Salad bar is nice, but small. For staple items, they offer a limited, but decent selection.\n\nProduce is the strong point: decent selection and quality is always top notch.

Being a man with a love of cameras I found this shop a delight. Its walls are stacked high with all kinds of finery: monoculars, binoculars, tripods, slide and film projectors, all manner of lenses, a museum-like array of old cameras (some dating back to the middle of the last century and before), digital cameras of various ages and types, old film, new film, camera bags, cleaning solutions and so on. \n\nI spent a long time enjoying looking around, and when it came to asking a couple of questions concerning a rather obscure piece of kit, they had good answers, and displayed that they really did know their stuff. \n\nThey do repairs too, and though I am fortunate enough to have not needed their help, I would infer from the look of the workshop at the back that they would know what they are doing. \n\nI would recommend that if you are a mechanical photographer, this should be your stockist, and if you are someone who wants any ancillary kit for either digital or film photography then this place is where you need to be.\n\nAs one final note: if you are lucky enough to glance up the stairs at the back, you may have the pleasant surprise of seeing the fluffy and friendly resident border collie lying lazily on the landing...",4

review_206711,shopping,"Went shopping here late Friday night...as in 9 PM.\n\nThis store has always attracted me for some reason.....maybe because it seems like a piece of history or something. There aren't too many upscale department stores left in mid-town Phoenix anymore. In fact none that I can even think of. It's great not having to drive out to the 'burbs somewhere to go shopping at a nice department store. I'm glad this store has survived.\n\nLike I said, I went shopping late Friday night so there weren't a whole lot of people in the store so it was VERY relaxing to shop and browse. \n\nI decided to get a Macy's credit card and approached a service desk. Literally within 2 minutes I had an account and was ready to go. I know it's the age of technology but getting a credit account at 9:15 on a Friday night in two minutes is pretty cool.\n\nDid some more shopping....I mean I had a 20% discount now with the new credit card (discount good for two days once you've opened an account). Got some pretty good deals on the clearance racks.\n\nAnd yes, it's pricey...but it's Macy's. Who doesn't expect to pay more at a department store? TJ Maxx and Marshalls are great options to find discounted clothing....but some of the deals on the Macy's clearance racks were just as good.\n\nThere were several reviews of this location criticizing the slow service. Didn't get that at all. Granted they weren't busy but the staff was all exceptionally nice and pleasant. Someone was always asking if I needed help, and yes, that can sometimes get annoying but they did it in such a pleasant manner that it wasn't bothersome. They were just trying to do their job. \n\nOne employee was exceptionally nice. He saw that I had just opened a new credit account and went out of his way to welcome me to the Macy's 'family.' It's stuff like that makes paying  extra sometimes worth it. \n\nBought a few items and was out by 9:40 or so. \n\nGreat 'old store' feeling, great service, great deals on the clearance racks.

review_315590,shopping,"I returned to Cakes this week after seeing another review describing their changes. So-the interior is much better. They replaced the chairs/coffee table in front of the magazine rack with tall bar tables/chairs. It looks good and fits in with the modernist/retro vibe. The cereal and take out box fees are gone (good). They instituted discounted multiple cupcake packs, so I took home a six pack of large cupcakes. It was $3.00 cheaper than the six small cupcakes I got the first time. The prices fit the product now (although I am aware of the problems with rising ingredient prices). The staff was friendly, and I was able to get in and out quickly.\n\nAs for the cupcakes: they were alright, the best being the chocolate ones. They are still a bit bland, the crumb was a bit tough and dry; part of that may be due to a tad overbaking or sitting out in the open air. I do not know how long they sit before getting eaten. I think the recipes still need some work-a denser, moister cake would fit a 'cupcake' bar. I even wondered it they were using some kind of pre-mixed package for the cake batter instead of 'from scratch.'  The cherry chocolate was the best that night; however, my sons did not like the cupcakes in general- too much greasy frosting..\n\nI might decrease (what I hope is) the butter and/or cream cheese, and increase the powedered sugar to give the frosting a bit more body. They might tinker with some cooked frostings, as these have staying power and body, even in hotter weather.\n\nI would also try for more intense flavors, thinking like this: the cake is either blander to show off the exquisite flavored frosting or more intense with the frosting as a supporting player. Even a vanilla cupcake with vanilla flavored frosting should use the best vanilla available so that the vanilla really stands out. I do not know if any of the employees are trained bakers, but haveing a consult w/a C.B. or CIA teacher from Chicago or perhaps even UIUC might be worthwhile. If this is their primary biz, then it makes sense to offer only the best, most memorable cupcakes possible. Really unusual combinations or oldies with a twist would be great, like those found in some of the recently published cupcake books, including vegan recipes. This is important for their takeout biz, and future large orders for receptions, parties, etc. Nevertheless, I hope they succeed and continue to work out the remaining kinks. Added 1 star and minus 1 $ now.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nDriving through downtown Champaign, I spy a banner  \""Cakes on Walnut,\"" and circle around. Aha! A cupcake bakery-only five years behind the emergence of the trend (which has already been declared, \""old,\"" by foodies, who insist the NBT will be \""pies\""...\"" Having been known for hunting down every cupcake spot in Chicago, I walk in. It takes 20 minutes to walk out with my cupcakes in tow (hmmm...not so good). I remembered all of this when I was checking my online account today. Six small cupcakes (including the $1.00 charge for the box! That is like slapping your customer for taking cupcakes home.) set me back $19.94. Problem? I can go to Fox and Obel for the biggest (bigger than their large), best cupcakes, made with the best ingredients for $3.00-and they do not even specialize in cupcakes! I am sure F & O's rent is higher than Cakes. I will leave aside their other offerings (and their inefficient footprint-they should check out The Bakehouse in Clayton, MO -St. Louis for a good example). After the novelty has worn off, what will they have? The cupcakes are ok, but not great, despite the 'sea salt caramel.' Either foodies will come (who will be more critical of the products) who have already been to similar places elsewhere or others will show up who do not know about, nor care for upscale flavorings-and they will balk at the prices. The biggest problem is that their venue must get repeat customers-and not just because they are the only ones offering novelty cupcakes. Other upscale bakeries will offer new cupcake combinations (easy enough) and poof!-their margin is gone! I really want to see better dining and bakery offerings succeed here, and perhaps we should look at new offerings in town as works in progress. My suggestions: drop the box charge-it is insulting to customers; lower the price for the small cupcakes or offer a 1/2 pack or dozen special (look at the successful cupcakeries elsewhere-they really make their money on bigger sales. Every time I sat inside a cupcake bakery, people would show up to pick up orders of dozens of boxes). Ditch the cereal (remember that cereal cafe that opened in Evanston and was featured in Bon Appetit? Well-it's gone)-or at least offer hand baked granola-it's easy to do! Keep some 'dry' soda for the once in a while customer, but don't advertise it so much. The test of success will be in the chilly fall-after the summer is over and the crowds are gone, and whoever wanted to try it out has done so. But what will you do to bring them back?",3

A junkies dream come true.  I had to make a choice of being late for my job I dislike or being on time and arriving empty handed.  I didn't wanna be late so I left.  Before I left a black lady was getting irritated and yelled about the lines being long.\n\nThe second to last time I was here a new line had just opened up and I had to power walk to it quickly and sneakily cut in front of an old couple so I could get out of here in a timely manner.  This place is a retail warzone.  Not really but the lines annoy me.,1

Most of their stuff was 60% polyester and up.\nMaybe I'm just cheap but I can get a better clothing at better prices from Buffalo Exchange or Revolve.\nI do not see the appeal.

review_643804,shopping,"After I had purchased approximately $6000 in various items over a 2 month time period, I mistakenly assumed that I had developed a good relationship with the folks at Conn's. While purchasing a blue-ray player, I asked a salesman if the player was wi -fi ready and he affirmed that it was.  When I opened the item, I found it was not.  I returned to the store to exchange the item, instead of simply returning the item, the manager referred to his return policy to deny the exchange. The item had exceeded the 30 day return window.  When we purchased the item we clearly stated that it was a gift to be given outside the 30 day period, and this was noted by the salesman on the ticket.\nSimply put, the store was more willing to lose a frequent customer than to exchange an 80 dollar blue-ray player (for a higher priced item that I would have paid for). Upon contacting their corporate office, I have learned that they consider their return policies concrete and of much greater importance than keeping customers.   I will recommend no one to this company.",0

I appreciated the fact that he showed me the used one because I am still very new to gold and do not want to spend a fortune on nicer clubs, but I also am past beginner sets.\n\nThe problem I have with this place is that there were signs stating the clothing was buy one, get another 50% off.  I picked up a few items and went to pay, but the cashier told me that the sale only applied to a few brands, not the brand I selected.  I did not argue because I had shopped on Amazon and new that even with the sale price I thought I was getting, Amazon was a little cheaper, I would just have to wait for delivery.

Fast forward.... Same charm chipped again, this time service was HORRIBLE. The saleslady insinuated that I didn't even purchase my charm from them, because it was missing something. Then she said I smashed it. Once she pulled up the receipt she said she was not able to replace the charm because it was passed the 90 days and management would have to approve.  When I returned the charm the first time it was 5 months after the purchase. Thanks to Foresquare I have proof. Anyway, I was expecting her to inspect my bracelet or offer to clean and polish it. I received nothing, not even the phone call from the manager which I left with the damaged charm. Needless to say I will never purchase another piece from this jeweler.

I buy a pound to a pound and a half a week of this stuff, and was going to them primarily for months and months.\nThere is one gentlemen their that occasionally would be the one getting me the jerky that was not a nice person, and treated my like \""why are you in this store\"". I never got a good attitude, from him, or frankly friendly service no matter how nice I am. The other gentlemen behind the counter were always very pleasant. The marinade jerky Ibuy was $20.00 a pound every time I was there. The last time he served me he all of a sudden charged me 28.00 a pound. I questioned, and then asked again, (really this went up eight dollars a pound in 3 days) he just said yes....no other explanation. found this strange. I took the manufacturer name off the case to see if I could find out if this was true, but figured first I would go in later when he wasnt serving and buy more.\nWhen I did, it was $20.00 a pound again, I asked if there had been a rate increase, and the nice person said no.\nThats all I needed, I now buy my jerky once or twice a week from one of the other stores that likes taking my money for their product.\nI left 2 stars because the other people in the store are all very nice, and didnt want to leave a single star for one persons actions. one bad apple spoils the barrel as they say.",1

review_226247,shopping,"One of the awesome things about Fruition is that it is proof positive that young people with a vision, a goal, and some business savvy can make, to be trite and cliche, their dreams a reality.  In the year and a half that Fruition's been operating, owners (and my friends) Chris and Samantha have built it from a store to a brand with a loyal following.  Focusing on vintage street wear, nearly anyone with an eye for unique fashion can find something that suits them inside the airy, funky digs on the corner of Flamingo and Maryland.   (Yep, right next door to Paymon's.)  With offerings from the 80s and the 90s, Chris, Samantha and their team of fashion connoisseurs stock the store with more urban funk than you can take in in one visit.  Find clothes from labels you're looking for to ones you've forgotten even existed (Cross Colors, anyone?)\n\nIn addition to dressing a good portion of the city, Fruition's dressed a good portion of the entertainment industry (Kanye West sound familiar?  Fergie?  M.I.A?) and they keep making huge strides forward to get their name known.  Regardless of their huge success, Fruition stays a Las Vegas entity.  They support the Las Vegas arts scene by hosting art shows in their space, and have a sidewalk sale at the Epicenter every First Friday.  They are some seriously suave young people with some seriously suave clothing and some seriously stellar plans for the future.  Get in on the ground floor.",4

review_499544,shopping,"The Forum Shops at Caesars are all overpriced high-end label stores. If you aren't looking to spend big bucks, the GAP, H&M, Bath & Body Works and Nike Town are your only real options. The stores are really geared toward your highrollers and guests who wish to blow the money they just won gambling.\n\nI still recommend visiting the Forum Shops b/c they are fun to window shop and the theme within the mall mirrors some of the streets of Rome with its fountains. Additionally, two of the fountains are animated. At the end of the strip of shops, there is a large circular aquarium with beautiful marine life within.\n\nMy advice, visit the Forum shops to view the scenery, but save your money and buy any luxury items at your local high end boutiques. The LasVegas Coach store, etc. carries the same exact items as my local south coast store does. \n\nThe forum shops feel grand with marbles and high ceilings every where. The most impressive sight is the entrance where there are spiral escalators with gigantic marbled statues beside and interior walls with large statues. I think there are 3 shopping floors. The first 2 floors are brand name stores: Burberry, Christian Dior, Dolce & Gabbana, Fendi, Gianni Versace, Gucci, Hublot, Louis Vuitton, Salvatore Ferragamo, Tiffany & Co., and Valentino. To see the moving statues, you need to reach the highest floor and go deep inside just to see them. I think every hour, there is a show but I missed it when I was there.\n\nThere are more boutiques toward and pass the moving statues. No food court on sight. By the time I reached the top floor, there was only Cheesecake Factory restaurant. There are many booths for gelatos and coffees but nothing to really fill up my belly. Very disappointed. So I walked back for almost an hour to find a restaurant elsewhere.\n\nTip: Wear comfy shoes as the floors feel very hard. Also, dine somewhere else before getting here.",3

review_209831,shopping,"I've only been to P.F. Chang's once, with a big group of co-workers, and I remember thinking that the food there was fine, in a suburban-mall sort of way. But even though its younger sibling, Pei Wei, nails the sexy interior design and appealing assortment of pan-Asian entrees you'd want in this sort of place, the execution leaves a lot to be desired. \n\nWe perused the menu and settled on three hard-to-fumble options: a Thai-style green chicken curry, orange-peel beef, and Pei Wei spicy chicken --- their approximation of General Tso's --- plus a side of edamame. Each entree came with a choice of white or brown rice.\n\nAs we waited for our food, I remarked that the decor seemed unexpectedly pleasant, maybe even nice enough for a casual date.  It's the kind of place you can imagine popping into while shopping, a little more upscale than the food court, but not a 'for-real' restaurant.\n\nThe edamame were served warmish, and tasted just like they do everywhere else. The Pei Wei chicken turned out to be everyone's favorite, although I definitely wouldn't call it spicy (even though the menu does). We enjoyed the green curry's flavor, although the chicken turned out more like meat-jelly, probably the result of over-marinating. The beef was the disappointment of the bunch, a sitcky-sweet mess of strangely chewy meat garnished with with huge slices of carrot... huh?

Remember not all WalMart stores carry the same stuff, chances are you'll stop here, look for what you know other WalMart stores in the valley carry and find much to your chagrin it's not there. Also if you like overripe avocados this is the store for you. And this store has their shaving blades locked up which can be a pain in the derriere if you need some on a Sunday night at 11 pm and you can't find any of the super slow staff to unlock the case for you. \n\nIn short this is a location best avoided. But if you are taking the back way to Lake Mead this is a good place to stop for those last minute cooler items you forgot, the fishing tackle you lost, or if you need something minor for your boat.

There was a husband and wife team that not only remembered us when we came in, but also our family and friends we had brought in for purchases.

I walked in and shopped for 25 minutes without even being greeted.  I gathered a few items and tried to make it to the front to pay, accidentally knocking over a picture and tripping over a candlestick someone set on the floor.  An employee was less than 15 feet away, straightening out pillows on a shelf and looked right at me to see what the noise was and did not even approach or ask if I was ok.  Another customer actually came over to help me up.  I then set 3 pillows that I was going to purchase on a table and waited for an employee to come over to ring me out for those and a large picture I could not move.  After another 10 minutes, NOBODY came over to help, so I decided today was not the day to shop there.  As I was leaving the store, I saw the older gentleman, with long gray hair, with 4 other employees standing by the door talking and looking at merchandise.  I let them know I had been in their store for 25 minutes, was never approached, had fallen and since nobody was around to accept payment for my items, I have decided not to purchase anything.

Then, like Hawaii, many tacky to nice souvenir products can be found here.  Basically, you will think you're in Hawaii, until you discover that no spam musubi is here.  For me, that's a good thing.",2

review_206104,shopping,"I have been wanting to try this Farmers Market out for a long time. When i go to the Downtown Market the veggies are already picked over...\nAny-who , so having the day off I decide to venture over, the sign says opens at 10, but when we pull up at 9:45  all the Granola Types are already  elbows deep in produce.. hope i didn't miss anything. \nMcClendons provides the bulk of the Produce and it looks really pretty, bright purple red beets, deep green leeks, fingerling potatoes  , shallots , farm fresh broccoli ,,yummy!   Much of the produce is organic and labeled to its origins , several items were from Willcox so mucho fresh. \n\nMcClendons has 5 registers open and there still is a line . Housewives are grabbing and picking veggies quick , you have to be quick on your toes not to be ran over .But it was worth it. \n\nAfter Veggies its mostly crafty stuff , soap, blankets(?), jewelry, yarn crafts, a bread stand.   So   not a whole lot.\n\nWould I go again , if I was in the area I definitely would want  to get fresh veggies. But I  wouldn't make much effort and I am usually at work . if you live close and are at home Wed. morning  yeah get over there and grab.",2

review_64442,shopping,"When I bought my first bedroom set, too many years ago, there were so many furniture stores and so many quality brands to choose from.  Not any more.  With apologies to my Asian friends, the Asian invasion of Cheap has taken over.  \nNow most furniture is made in Viet Nam or China, with poor craftsmanship, but still with relatively high prices. Oh, I guess you can still find quality, if you want to spend $12,000.  We don't.\n\nAfter striking out at the few remaining free-standing furniture stores, but skipping known crapola joints like Ashley's, we headed to Macy's Home.  If I hadn't noticed the store casually while driving past it one night, we never would have found it, since we were coming from the opposite direction this time, and the store is well-set back in its unusual Chinatown location.  Also, it was nighttime and the store was not lit up at all; it looked like it was closed.\n\nTo its credit, we were helped immediately by a very knowledgeable saleswoman, Rochelle, who spent a good amount of time with us.  She showed us everything available in the contemporary style we were looking for, but as I suspected, the prices - even \""on sale,\"" (and I use the term loosely, since that stuff is always \""on sale,\"") were too high for the shoddy workmanship of the products.  I guess the concept of Dove-Tailed drawers went out with Noah's Ark.\n\nSo I will wait until the set I've been looking at on Costco's website goes on sale, and then I'll get my dove-tailed drawers.",1
review_346034,shopping,"On our first day in Montreal, our group came to Jean-Talon to check out all the different foods that were available. The basic gist is that there is one main building that houses a variety of different shops - in particular a good number of butchers - as well what looks like a produce aisle further down. The whole market is surrounded by a few vendors outside, as well as lots of little shops that surround the main lot. It's not like the indoor markets I've been to in the U.S., such as Reading Terminal in Philadelphia or Chelsea Market in NYC, but it's got a good enough amount of space that it never feels crowded (which those others can at times). The one thing I wasn't a huge fan of was that there seemed to be a lot of repetitiveness when it came to what the butchers were selling - lots of places selling the same kinds of meats, and a number of fruit and veggie stands not really standing out. That said, the places that we did go to were fabulous. There was a beer store that also happened to sell an incredibly delectable maple and beer-soaked ham that tasted absolutely phenomenal. Paired with a very fresh baguette we bought at one of the bread shops, as well as a brie-like cheese that was covered in raspberries and a slightly stinky cheddar from a cheese shop, made for a very delicious lunch. I also had a chocolate chip cookie from one of the bakeries that was made using maple sugar...that was a pretty great combo, and I've had many delicious cookies in my time. On the disappointing side, I got a slightly burnt cinnamon and sugar crepe on the way out which I am pretty sure I was overcharged for.\n\nIn all, there are plenty of good places within Jean-Talon to check out. On balance, you're not going to find winners everywhere, but there are plenty of very delicious places to check out. For the most part, things seemed reasonably priced, and it's easy enough to find a spot on the curb to savor your findings if it's nice weather outside.",2

The breakfast service seems new - it wasn't as organised as the rest of their usually good service.  \n\nIt was, however, generous and delicious.  Not haute cuisine but perfectly tasty breakfast nonetheless, and good coffee.  It was a hard choice, as usual, to choose what to have...all the deli items are so tempting that actually plumping for a traditional breakfast seemed a heart-breaking waste!\n\nThe odd item I've ordered in the past doesn't quite reach the otherwise high standard of their deli choices but, overall, a consistently good to excellent experience.  I don't think I've ever been truly disappointed any of the times I've been here and feel a little like I'm being unfair only giving three stars rather than four.

The merchandise was very organized and the store was clean. Unfortunately, customer service is pretty bad here.\n\nMy husband saw a pair of shoes that he liked and wanted to try them on. One employee was busy helping another customer with tailoring, and two other employees were laughing and talking in one of the back rooms with the door wide open. Funny thing is that I'm pretty sure they saw us, along with 2 other customers wanting to try on shoes. Yet, they decided to ignore us all! After waiting for a while, we decided to go up to the counter to ask for help. Someone finally helped us, but disappeared shortly after bringing out the shoes. We wanted to buy them, but no one came to the register, as we stood there for 5 minutes. We handed the shoes to the employee who was still busy with a customer in the tailoring section and left.\n\nHorrible customer service! I don't see how this place stays in business when they don't want to help their customers or even pay attention to what is going on in the store! Definitely would not recommend.

While I check out all the make up and nail polishes, he checks out the colognes and other men products they offer. The staff is usually pretty helpful and the more you explore the store, the more you get approached by different employees to assist you with any questions on products. I tend to brush a lot of them off as I am more of a loner and like to browse on my own whatever is new from my favorite brands.. \n\nMy boyfriend is more of a talker and a specific employee by the name of Dennis always assists him and seems to be super informed of all the different ingredients involved in any of the new colognes out. He's beyond helpful and even had a great spirit about him that ends up having my boyfriend walk out with 3 or more colognes at a time! \n\nOverall I can't think of a brand they don't carry that isn't essential to any girls life! They also have a beauty insider card you can sign up for and eventually can accumulate points and get pretty neat freebies!

Walking in the door, I saw a bunch of breads (maybe that's why they call it \""Bread Basket\"").  Not seeing pastries I was ready to leave until the man behind the counter asked what I was looking for.  He directed me to a handful of chocolate muffins, cinnamon rolls and scones.  He also showed me some huge bread things filled with cheese and spinach, which looked really good.  He then rolled out a cart filled with savory pastries like pig in a blanket, roll with spicy cheese and a turkey and provolone roll, all of which had just come out of the oven.  I ended up taking one each of he savory rolls.  These huge rolls cost me less than $8.  That's a bargain!\n\nTaking my haul to the office, I cut the rolls into segments and shared with everyone.

review_235243,shopping,I went to Eriks looking for some help on which board to order from there website.  Dave helped me find the right board and was really nice. I also ended up getting bindings at a killer deal that go with the board. He had them shipped to the store and is setting it up for me. Will definitely be back heat Eriks to do more business. I have finally found a shop where customer service is great and prices are low! Thank you to Eriks and Dave.,4
review_250518,shopping,"If Mexico were to pick up and move to West Phoenix, it would reside in Ranch Market.  \n\nThe closest thing I can compare it to is the Mexico exhibition at Epcot Center.  It is large, colorful, has occasional mariachis and folklorico dancers...babies, Mexicanas shopping in full makeup and high heels and men with big mustachios...oh, and food, glorious food.\n\nThis place is phenom.  It has a beautiful panaderia, (albeit the pan dulces are a bit on the hard side-I don't eat them from here...go to La Purisima in Glendale), a carniceria, cremeria, fruteria...you get it.  Ranch Market is like a proper mercado in Mexico.  \n\nThey also have a \""cafeteria\"" where you can get menudo on Sundays (don't miss it), and all kinds of tacos, tamales, enchiladas, burritos, carne asada, etc. any other time of day.  Their $2 breakfast burrito is enough to make anyone stop buying breakfast groceries.\n\nI live in Florida and absolutely LOVE going home to Phoenix and coming here everyday.  The produce is always really nice and fresh, and CHEAP!!  I've heard they only buy from farms in Mexico. \n\nSo, although you might need a passport and a translator to shop here, I swear to GOD it is worth it.",3

There is no need to eat prior to the market-- between the samples, the food and the beverages not eating was the best thing ever. \n\nAnother thing I appreciated.. this market was totally calm, relaxed... most farmer's markets back home (minus Santa Cruz) is super uptight and folks are pushy..... definitely a spot to stroll, eat and enjoy the morning...... \n\nThe Farm Sessions concept I LOVED.",4

Sure enough, they did. They had both the pantyhose kind in the pantyhose section towards the front and the bodyshaping kind in the undergarment section in the back. \n\nThe staff here was very friendly.

The only real complaint I have about this place is some of the prices.  The Asian candy costs just as much here and sometimes more than in \""American\"" stores  I could probably drive to San Diego get the same things at my old store and drive back for less than it costs  here.  I also don't like how some (more than a few) of the produce is going to go bad within a day if not use and some already looks like it went bad.\n\nBut at this place, a lot of random out there items can be found, and their meat dept doesn't seem bad at all and actually reasonable",3

review_336728,shopping,"One word: pretentious. \n\nWhile their clothing collections always look crisp and fresh (no, we're not talking lettuce here people), they are highly over-priced for the quality of the clothing that they sell. In addition, many of their collections seem inspired by furniture or curtain fabrics. I don't know what's up with that. It's very preppy with a dash of hipster so if that's your thing, you'll be very happy. That said, beware - most of their items are dry-clean only, and those that are washable in your washing machine will fade very quickly. \n\nThe staff is uninterested and seem to have a superiority complex about their place of work. It's a clothing store, where the bulk of the clothes is made in China - not the UN. Get over yourself. Don't expect a high level of service unless you walk in clearly advertising your wealth. Then perhaps the staff will remember that their job is to greet you with a smile, and help you spend your money.",1

review_144254,shopping,"There's nothing that makes a gal smile like a clean car!\n\nRegency does a really good job getting your ride nice and clean. They hand wash your car here so you won't have to worry about mysterious scratch marks that show up on your car if you were to go elsewhere. They wipe down everything so clean on the inside, too. No cutting corners here. The best part is that they're extremely efficient. You're in an out in less than half an hour for a basic interior/exterior car wash. \n\nThey throw in a free air freshener as well with a full car wash. Lots of different smells to choose from. I always get the pina colada because I feel like I always have a party in my car! If you're a UNLV student, make sure you flash your student ID because they give you 10% off of their services! I'm not sure if they do this anymore, but if you save receipts from 5 visits (at least I think it's 5), they'll throw in a free wash. \n\nTheir price has gone up a little over the last few years. But their prices are still competitive with other car wash places. I will say though, you can't beat the service and the quality here!",3

I came in to buy a play pen and a hammock for my car, but left with a basket full of toys and treats!

The bad, a worker named Sam gave us attitude and acted like she was doing us a favor while the other worker (her manager) wanted to give us a discount on a bag (10%) she had something personal with us it seemed.

review_314417,shopping,"This place is a great concept.... you go in, pick up food to go/ take out.  It is all prepared and packaged to go, they have fancy deli cases filled with different meals.  They have different meals each day.  It is expensive and I have to say that when I was picking out what I wanted, all I wanted to do was got to Chipotle next door.  The portions looked small and the prices were steep, but I picked out a really nice salmon salad-- it ended up being way more filling than I had anticipated.  Anyhow, I can see how some people would really love this place and this concept.  \n\nIt's great if you don't like to cook or know how to cook-- I am thinking this place was made for the single man with finer tastes in food instead of going to the fast food drive thru. \n\nI don't know if I'll ever go back. It's up in the air.   I am interested to hear what other people have to say.",2
review_422276,shopping,"This place is amazing! I walked away with the Espresso Balsamic Vinagrette, Fig Vinagrette, and Chipotle Vinagrette. I was most blown away by the Espresso Balsamic Vinagrette. It paired really well with Greek Yogurt. I wish it weren't so expensive to have shipped, especially when you're buying 3 or 4 bottles at $16 a pop! My BFF also purchased several bottles of Vinagrette and oils. Lucky for her she was driving back to Tuscon so she didn't have to bit the shipping charge. Oh well for me, they didn't really have sympathy for my plane ride back to CA and the fact that had they accomodated me a little better, I likely would have purchased several other items such as the Citrus Vinagrette and Truffle Oil ( I believe that was $12 for a rather small bottle, but delicious). Thanks to the cashier who volunteered the neat Olive Oil and Vinegar establishment in La Jolla! She convinced me that the place in La Jolla was even better then Outrageous Olive Oils and had better prices.",2

We go to this location when we're in town and visiting friends, usually multiple visits in a weekend for supplies, and never any real issues.  I'd say I wish that the self-check lanes were limited more on the number of items that a person could check out for themselves as it can tie the lines up a little but there are enough checklanes that it's only just a minor annoyance.  Excellent liquor department, though the layout was a little confusing at first.  Otherwise, clean, friendly service and we'll be back.",4

There were only two lanes open other than self-check, and the person doing my lane was very slow at the job.

review_486379,shopping,"I've recently moved to Queen Creek and I've been coming to this location to do my weekly grocery shopping. Everytime I come to this store I become more and more disappointed. For example I am a price compare shopper and more than a few times I've gone the products that are on sale that week are always sold out. I've tried going in the mornings, night and times where people are more likely to not be there thinking they would be available from night stocking but the shelves are still empty. Yes I agree with the previous reviewer about always having crates out throughout the day. It gets annoying trying to zig zag your way out of each aisle. The people who work here are very rude. The vibe I get from these people is the vibe I get when you don't like your job and don't care about giving good customer service. I'm starting to go to the other Wal-Mart off of Rittenhouse and there is a big difference on everything. It's clean, workers want to help and actually look like they enjoy being there, shelves are always stock even when their on special and the aisles are clear from crates.

It's really nice because when the lot is full, it's great to be close to a sidewalk so when the kids are unstrapped, they can stand out of the way while I gather everything up for the shopping trip. \n\nThe security guards in this place are so nice. One of the guys has to have worked there now for years, and he remembers me when I come in. And then they have a sampling area. The guy will sometimes let one of the kids pick out a box of cookies that they think will make the best \""sampler\"". He's always super friendly and willing to help you with suggestions. \n\nThere is always a sale section. It's always my first stop. There are lots of premade things that are delicious. It's great for me on those days where I am too overwhelmed to cook, but still want the kids to eat home made food. And their soups... mmm.... try the tortilla. My son likes the California Rolls.\n\nThe prices are good, the food is really fresh. It's a little more expensive than fry's with coupons, but it's worth the convenience sometimes. \n\nAnd they are also very generous with non profits. I really love this store, can't say enough good things about it.",4

(Didn't see the HK toaster though.) \n\nAs I explorered further I found Anime t-shirts, DVD's and figurines to a cooler with various drinks that looked interesting to what I am assuming was religious stuff for Shinto and Buddhism practioners. They had car stuff including a wide angle rear view mirror I snapped up, but I was amazed with the Bento boxes and other food items. Sushi trays, sake glasses, and chopsticks...from the basic to some that looked like works of art, they had a little bit of everything. \n\nI found the pricing to be reasonable, and service was great when I asked for help finding a bento box I was looking for.

review_337115,shopping,"I agree with Charles, we don't have a lot of options in English bookstores, and this Indigo is quite nice. Architecturally it's uplifting, with the ground floor opening up with an open circle staircase to a larger second floor at a central corner spot on McGill and St Catherine, two floors with high ceilings, two walls of windows. I mean it's a chain where all the fonts and colours in all the cities are the same and the actual owner is elsewhere, so I try to support Paragraph up the street on McGill, or Drawn and Quarterly, or the secondhand bookstores instead, but sometimes you just need to be surrounded by more books. I have always found the staff in the fiction and music sections at this Indigo to be super nice, knowledgeable and helpful and not on the sell. The caf\u00e9 has good quality coffee and some tasty sandwiches, some of the seating is hard and wobbly, but there are a few big comfy chairs tucked by the giant windows if you get lucky.",2

That being said, we get most of our clothing and a good amount of kitchen gadgets there when they are having a sale (they let you combine your coupons on top of their store sales) and returns are usually quick and painless.  \n\nBecause I know my way around the store though, I really don't ask a lot of questions while I'm in there so not a lot of interaction with employees other than the cashiers (I've always been pleased with them though--friendly and helpful when I forget my coupons).",3

I'm a meat-and-potatoes kind of guy who like specialty foods on occasion.  TJ's is OK in that: 1. I couldn't buy my staples here in the first place, 2. gourmet extras here are cheaper than Harris Teeter.\n\nI love the randomness of this store-it's like a gourmet Big Lots.  The meat and produce is pricey, but the packaged goods, juices, and beverages merit an occasional visit.  They have mango-flavored juice similar to NakedJuice for $1 less.  The breads are fresh and varied-ciabatta, pitas, several types of tortillas.  I recently bought a big ciabatta loaf for $2!  While the produce costs a few G's, they have every variation of dried, canned, and sweetened fruit imaginable.   Also, the alcohol selection is unique.  \n\nThe staff are very friendly and there is almost always coffee, wine, or some type of appetizer they are giving away.

I went down to Jareds to compare rings and pricing. The store clerk at Jareds noticed that my purchase was not as high quality diamonds as the one in the Jared Vault store. My purchase had more of a yellow tint to the diamonds and the price should have been only $1699.\n\nJareds Vault claims they are a discount store where actually they are not.

He introduced himself as a two letter name which I will not be so low as to reveal here we will just call him B.S. because it is going to fit the story. Well B.S. showed us some nice furniture and we picked out everything. A really odd thing was as we selected furniture B.S. could never tell us the exact price of what we were buying and he was writing everything down on paper. So anyway we finish picking stuff out and he gives us a general idea of the price. We say we will think about it and leave.\n\nA week later my wife goes back in finalizes our selection and is given a total price of $5400 OTD. She informs B.S. that I will be in next saturday to pay the entire balance and set up delivery. So I show up saturday he shows me all chosen products and we sit down to handle payment. The price he now quotes is $6800. I laugh at him and he does some backtracking about what he said then changes the price to $6400 to which I continue to laugh at. \n\nI tell him to give me a print out of this price break down with each item so I can take it back to my wife and ask if she wants to continue working with B.S. and if so to choose which items to remove because our moving budget does not allocate this amount to furniture.\n\nB.S. calls us again and tells us to pick out a few cheaper items to get down to the $5400.

They have an amazing Chumley t-shirt selection in the back LOL.\n\nFunny thing about this street, there are wedding chapels, pawn shops, and strip joints all next to each other.  In El Hub's words, you could pretty much buy a ring at a pawn shop, propose to your lady, celebrate your bachelor party at the strip joint, AND THEN get hitched all in one car ride!",2

review_421153,shopping,"We were in the area and both of us were hungry, but not ready for a full on, sit-down meal. Thus, as we passed this location, we decided to make a u-turn and get a couple doughnuts to hold us over until it was time for a more substantial meal.\n\nParking was easy enough and the lot is laid out well for the regular in and out traffic this place sees. The line was pretty long, but it was a weekend and 10:30 a.m. so not overly surprising. Once we got to the front of the line, we waited for one of the cashiers to stop talking about the customer that had just ordered and walked away long enough for us to place our order. Didn't love that, but he wasn't really being mean about the customer, just more talking about his reaction to the coffee he ordered, but I didn't enjoy the open discussion about customers right in front of other customers and making us wait to order while you do it.\n\nWe were going to order two doughnuts a piece and told them our two choices each and ended up having to repeat ourselves since the cashier and the person boxing the doughnuts were different people and they didn't communicate what we ordered. The cashier did, however, let us know that ordering a half dozen was about the same price as four individual doughnuts, so we opted to do this instead.\n\nWith our box in hand we went to find a seat to eat. The doughnuts themselves were very tasty and the usual yumminess you expect from this chain. The tables themselves definitely needed some attention, but the never ending line that persisted while we were there gives them some leeway on cleaning tables efficiently.  \n\nOverall: B-\nStandard goodness of doughnuts you expect from this chain, not such amazing services and only semi-clean location. Not the best ever, not the worst ever!",2
review_392874,shopping,"I have been to  this car wash about 10 times now. Great every time. They have several different prices to choose from. However, i always choose the $5.00 wash. It is by far the best deal in town. you pull in and pay your $$ cash or credit.  They give you a blue cloth that you throw away when through to wipe out all the inside of your car while you drive through the car wash. I don't know what is on it but,it cleans wonderfully......then you go through the car wash . It is nice and cool in there. They do a fantastic job!!  Plus free vacuum if you have time to stop and do that. For a quick wash that is excellent this place is my favorite by far.",4

And yes, I do mean the very lunch box that was recently sold online for $165!\n\nMy dad went in when it first opened and told me that it was horrible. But my dad isn't like me. He won't spend hours lurking secondhand shops for bargains.\n\nToday was my first time going and I was really impressed. The store is huge, and very clean. It's not like Goodwill where you feel like you need to stand under a science lab shower immediately after leaving the store. Maybe I'm the only one who feels that way, but whatever!\n\nThey had a big collection of very cute, vintage tins. I picked a Snow White one up for $4. They had a pretty big pile of vintage clothing patterns, each 70 cents. The two I got are from 1969 and 1970! My best find was the Spice Girls lunchbox. I nearly died when I saw it sitting on the shelf, staring back at me... When I was in kindergarten, I envied my friend for having one and loathed my mom for depriving me of one. But thanks to Savers, that grudge has been laid to rest as I am finally the proud owner of a Spice Girls lunchbox!\n\nNext time I am in the mood for bargain shopping, I will definitely skip Goodwill and head straight for Savers!",3

As a full time student and worker, those are really the only times I get to waste time shopping at the store. And I mean waste in every sense of the word. \n\nEvery.single.time. I go to this particular location I remind myself I'll never go back. Yes, I said NEVER, but living down the street and this being the closest grocery store, never really means I won't go back this week. So I find myself returning -- abusee/abuser relationship much? and my experience never changes. Anytime I'm at this location, there is only one checkout aisle open. Yes, I said that - ONE. So I quickly pick up the items I need-- you know, bread, milk, water, maybe a snack or two and then I painfully wait in line for what seems like an eternity - hey once I even watched hair grow on my legs as I waited... jk- but really 20 minutes go by and I finally get to the checkout. Plug in an old phone number for my Safeway card and finalize my painstakingly long order.\n\nAfter writing this review I sure hope I'll smarten up and just go to infinitely better stores (Sprouts or Fresh & Easy) down the road!",0

review_98431,shopping,"I usually like going to this market because they have great deals on the produce. Some of the staff though...*clears throat*... So Friday, I decided to stop in and pick up a few things. I started checking out and the cashier, Virginia was nice, but the sacker, not so much. Quite an a-hole actually.  Ole short Bud Bundy from Married With Children looking guy. I think he may be newer than most of the other people there. \n\nSo I got different types of apples that were located in the bins specifically saying .89/lb. The 1st set of apples, the cashier rings them up  @ 1.29/lb and I tell her that the bin where I got them said .89/lb. Virginia says, well they're 1.29/lb and then asks me do I still want them. I needed apples so I said fine.  They same thing happened with the 2nd set of different apples.  Why would I pay $1.29/lb for apples when I could get ORGANIC from a store such as Sprouts or Fry's? Like...whet? So the bagger says \""Well I can see the sign from here and they say 1.29\"" I say \""I didn't get those there, I got them in the bins by the oranges and strawberries.\"" He then goes off to the section that I just told him that I DIDN'T get the apples, and then proceeds to come back and tell me the 1.29/lb price. Sir, seriously?  I again told him that was not the section where I got the apples and he tells me, \""Well  I'm not about to go running around the store.\"" I'm sorry, whet? Are you not at work? Are you not getting paid? I said to him \""You act like this store is huge, you only went about 15 steps and didn't even go to where I said I got them.\""  Hell if he didn't want to be a sacker/runner, he should've applied to be a cashier so that he could just stand there and just have to move his arms!\n\nI can't stand when people go into work and act like it kills them to, ya know, WORK. If you don't want to be at work CALL IN. Nobody needs the attitude!

Don't by produce (even if it looks perfect) to store for more than one day, or that beautiful apple will turn brown and spotty before your eyes. Kinda weird, but it happens, not sure why and not even the workers there can believe it sometimes. That day i returned them, they looked at the date on the package thinking it must have been on sale or something, only to read that i just bought them the day before and they were not on sale. Her eyes told me the entire story...she, just as i, was wondering how a perfectly red apple could have turned so bad overnight. It may have something to do with the types of specials they get, to keep their prices so low. Guess those articles about them in Europe selling bad food for cheap is somewhat true.

review_368748,shopping,"Harvey Nichols is undoubtedly Edinburgh's chicest and most stylish department store. Over four levels, you'll find premium cosmetics, a nail bar, the latest in designer fashion and accessories, a food hall and a restaurant, bar and brasserie. Generally I only come here for the bar, beauty and food hall - everything else is slightly out of my price range. However, the sales can be pretty epic; I once found a pair Miu Miu jeans reduced to \u00a320, so there are bargains to be had if you're canny enough.\n\nThey really pull out all the stops with their exciting and adventurous window displays (think a massive dinosaur made out of coat-hangers or paint splattered mannequins dressed in scarily expensive clothes), it's a spectacle worth seeing, even if you can't afford any of the goods they're displaying.

I appreciated all her help and attention. I told her that I just couldn't commit at that time. \n\nI needed to see what my other options were- to see other dresses.

That was my choice and no big deal, what was a big deal was the attitude when I got inside.  I went the customer service counter to get the book I reserved and was told that it was at the checkout counter, I go the the checkout counter and when it couldn't be found, and I explained that I had just reserved this morning, the sales lady got rather rude and asked if I had gotten an e-mail that it was ready.  I was then advised that it was at customer service.  I explained that I was at customer service and was told it was supposed to be there.  So with continued rudeness I was told that since I had just reserved it on-line, it was still at customer service desk as they had not had time to bring it to the front.  Wow, it must have been my fault for reserving it on line and arriving to soon after-wards to get it.\n\nI asked about the $2.00 difference in price and was told they do not match on line prices.  The \""excuse\"" I was given was their \""overhead\"" was higher.  I was born at night, but it wasn't last night and I do not for a minute by that line of B.S.\n\nFor for these reasons, I'll buy either second hand books or from independent book stores.

They are selling colored jeans, funky shoes, great accessories,, etc. \n\nThe only downfall is that I believe the prices seem to be marked WAY up.  I saw a beaded necklace in there for $55.00 and I bought the SAME EXACT necklace a few weeks prior at LA East in Blakeney for $5.00.  Umm...that is a HUGE difference.  Granted it was on sale when I bought it but even the orginal price wasn't close to $55.  Then I saw a pair of earrings that I own from Ivey and Leo.  Again, the price was marked up.  \n\nI think some of their buyers just go into Charlotte and find some great deals and then go back to Fort Mill and mark it all up...\n\nIf that conspiracy theory is true then they need to expand their purchasing outside of a 15 mile radius.  Fort Mill is still considered the great Charlotte area so they probably won't get away with that for too long.  \n\nCute place though, worth stopping in and of course it is right by Cupcrazed bakery so you can nail two birds with one stone.  \n\n**Tip, try on clothes before stuffing your face with a cupcake---you'll have better results :)",2

Lots of specialty jams, honeys, savory spreads, crackers and pickled veg. I bought a jam and a honey, tried a piece of cheddar. When I have cheese needs I'll know where to come!",3

review_593410,shopping,"I am a fan of heathy living, and this was my first visit into a Sprouts store. This is a very nice clean store with beautiful produce, friendly and knowledgeable staff! Some produce which is difficult to find in other grocery stores were found here. For example, I was happy to discover lovely heads of escarole and fris\u00e9e endive among the produce aisles, and a fair variety of sprouts! They have a butcher shop with an offering of freshly made bulk sausages (delicious!) and fresh meatballs in the packaged meat section. They have a good variety of bulk coffees however no bulk tea- I was looking for bulk black tea. They also offer a small variety of  chemical-free cleaning products, which probably could be expanded.\n\nSince it was a couple days before Christmas, I was astounded to discover the store completely lacked any kind of gift baskets, so I bought  individual bags of pistachios, corn nuts, peppermint malt balls, etc as gifts, and figured out myself how to pretty them up for gift giving.\n\nAlso I was kinda hoping to find a fresh juice bar inside. There's a perfect space for it in the back, by the produce section along the wall where the coconut water is currently residing. The staff tells me that juice bar installations are planned for two other local sprouts stores but not this one.\n\nAs another person mentioned,  I agree there is a smell (from the meat dept?) at the entrance only--it's probably a simple problem with the ventilation, but it is a bit off-putting, if you get a whiff of it.",3
review_466012,shopping,"Review number 136 of this quaint little bakery is going to be short and sweet (no pun intended) and to the point. I loved the place. Like a little piece of Paris right on Butler Street. \n\nThe pastry looked amazing but I wasn't there for the buttery, flakey croissants, the eclairs, or other delectable treats. I wanted a loaf of crusty, airy spelt flour bread. I wasn't disappointed. Besides all the treats you'd be served at a French cafe, they also serve up some pretty mellow and smooth coffee. My only beef, just like any business on Butler Street, the parking is ridiculous.",2

review_420313,shopping,"I love Harris Teeter have since I was a little girl it's just a great grocery store always clean, nice people (almost) but then you run into those people who act as if your are not in their league.  And I figure this much because of the kind of grocery store it is, well my money spends just like yours.  Any who, I for the most part try to always go to the u-scan thing where I can do it my self and get moving and not have to wait in long lines.  There is only one lady that help work the u-scan who actually sits there and do her job which is great because that's why she's there.  I went in there the other day and the girl who was at the main scanning thing was too busy talking to her friends that she wasn't paying attention to anything that was going on.  I had to stand there for several minutes trying to get her attention so she could help me.  She really wasn't interested in doing so, I think it bothered her that I needed help and she had to break away from her very important conversation.  Well I say if you want to have conversations go home, get someone else to stand in her place that will do there job.  It's not hard to just stand there and assist when needed.  More importantly I've noticed that lately the u-scan machines are always down maybe 2 of the 4 actually work.  It's frustrating because sometimes they only have 1 register open.  I'm really having issues with Harris Teeter lately they need to get it together.  Got a million and 1 stores in Charlotte and surrounding areas, got a new grocery store coming to town going to give the competition I'm sure so they need to step it up.",3
review_246569,shopping,I absolutely love this bike shop. I bought my bike here a little over a year ago. Today I took it in because it hasn't been ridden for a while.

review_235282,shopping,"Trader Joe's is what chain grocery stores like Pick'n Save (or anything under the Roundy's umbrella including Copp's and Rainbow), Piggly-Wiggly, Cub Foods, etc. should aspire to be like in terms of service and product.\n\nThat said, the one in Madison is especially clean and very tidy--things are pretty well organized that you can find what you're looking for by just looking around at the area of food it would be under. The prices are on the higher side of being affordable, but understandable as they attempt to make them a little more beneficial and \""healthier\"" to some extent (not always true, but they try in a lot of cases.)\n\nHere are some of my favorite products I'd recommend trying: Korean Short Ribs, Dark Chocolate Mint Creams, Sweet Potato Fries, Chili Pepper Sauce (not as spicy, but has a great flavor), and many of their meat cuts are pretty great too.\n\nI'd avoid: the breads are only so-so, Sweet and Sour Chicken, TJ's soy sauce (you can get better and cheaper elsewhere), and milk (if you're getting Kemp's this is, again, cheaper elsewhere).\n\nTJ's is great, but if I had a choice, I'd prefer Whole Foods at a cheaper price. Regardless, this is still a solid store and I go here when I'm particularly craving some good meals I can stick in the oven while I do homework.",2

review_312,shopping,"I'm a mattress buying novice. I also hate buying things that require you to try-before-you-buy. I also seem to give explanatory information about myself before reviews. Anyway. \n\nI had a lot of anxiousness about buying a mattress. If it's terrible, you'll be spending a large proportion of your life in misery until you fix the problem. Who wants that? Especially for something that can be as expensive as a mattress? \n\nThese people were great. They patiently answered all of my mattress questions and treated me like a valued customer - both times I called, the man on the phone remembered my name (and number!) and took care of me. When I failed to buy a box spring (why oh why did I think I could go without a box spring??) they were able to take care of me over the phone and get me a box spring in the SAME day. Within hours, even. They even helped me set up the mattress that I DIDN'T purchase from them, which blew me away. \n\nTheir professionalism and friendliness are excellent. I will recommend them to everyone who's in the market for a mattress, especially students, because their student deals are fantastic.",4

review_158361,shopping,"This is my updated review from a 1 star rating.\nThis particular Woodmans has rubbed me the wrong way! \n\n\n#1 complaint---Their produce is cheap and goes bad within a day if not used immediately! To name a few things: Forget buying green peppers or nice lettuce/spinach here---unless u want to eat them within a day of purchase. I've had one too many bad produce problems to say anything positive. \n\n#2 complaint--- There are too many people using too many methods of payment at the registers, which in turn is holding up the lines.\nIn specific:I sat for a very long time as a I watched a couple trying to reach a specific dollar amount  ($200) and continued to ask for how much they purchased while they grabbed multiple sources of junk food (candy bars) to fulfill their transaction and held up the line. \n\nThe last time I checked my shopping must be completed when I decide to get in line and check out. \n\n-Hey Woodman's----Try adding some more open registers. I do not want to sit in line to check out for long periods of time when I see you have so many registers just sitting there not being used. Look at your parking lot----It is always full of cars!!! This should tell you one thing, hire more people!\n\n-If you would like to avoid confrontation in your stores, please start providing training to your cashiers to move things along better when people are trying hold up the line-----I'm paying cash or debit card and will not be taking any longer to pay then a few seconds. ----Maybe make a few registers open for \""cash or debit card only\"". or a line that says \""for customers that have fully completed their shopping experience\"". \n\n#3 Complaint--=This store is HUGE! If you forget something on your list (if you made a list) your going to have to run across the entire store to go get it. We are talking long isles, and lots of them. Too much trouble for me just to head back for a loaf of bead when I'm standing in the ice cream isle. \n\nI think there are many other store options in the Madison area better than this particular Woodman's.\n \nWoodman's is employee owned, and for that instead of a previous \""1 star\"" I give them \""2 stars\"". Not to mention they do have a very nice liquor department. But overall---I'm not reviewing a liquor store, am I? \n\nThis store is popular to the masses and is usually swamped with people, so if you plan to come here, please prepare yourself in advance for pure craziness.\n\n\nNot my first choice for grocery shopping in the Madison Area.",1
review_431608,shopping,"I LOVE the Ferragamo brand, the quality, the fit. There isn't anything I don't love about the products but this particular store falls short. It is over-lit for one thing. I felt a need for dark glasses in there. Products are displayed in a very sterile manner which left me thinking, \""Is this all they've got? Just a lesson, look at your San Diego/Fashion Valley store, compare and then fix the problems at the Scottsdale store. \n\nThe one thing which really put me off was the two rather young sales girls which were literally perched just inside the store like vultures on a perch, waiting. This reminded me of the old Westward Pontiac in Phoenix (North 7th Street and Highland, a block south of Camelback). There they had the showroom up on a raised platform several feet above the parking lot. In front of it they had a metal railing where salesmen would hang out, literally like perched vultures waiting to fly off and swoop down on a customer. The two girls at Ferragamo brought back that vivid memory. \n\nGive the brand the respect it deserves. Don't let your sales girls stand there eyeballing people as they walk by. It's creepy. It's intimidating. It really put me off. Dim the lights and get more product in the store. I go there to buy really fine shoes, not to look at the latest in commercial wall light sconces. Ferragamo is SO much better than the impression this store leaves. I headed to Nordstrom to see Ferragamo stuff. \n\nThen again, it's Scottsdale. Without a certain amount of tacky, things don't fit.",1

There isn't a line for anything, so you really need to pay attention what they're calling out. Ended up being around $25 for those three items. Lobster tail was eh, cream was bland and the pastry was crispy to the point where it was hard. California cheesecake was nothing special or unique. The crumb cake was the most disappointing, it tasted like a dry sponge with brown sugar lumps on top, not even kidding. Don't waste your time or money here.",1
review_88979,shopping,"A mattress is a serious investment.  Especially a king sized, which we were after.  \n\nSo we searched high and low, did our research, took \""test drives\"" and concluded that a mattress here was the one we wanted to spend many years of nights on.\n\nWe probably gave the saleswoman the easiest sale she'd had all month.  We walked in, laid down on the mattress one more time, and told her happily \""We'll take it!\""\n\nBut rather than be happy with our rather large purchase, she was flabbergasted that we weren't interested in a $100+ mattress protector.  She tried pitch after pitch, only to be politely told \""No, thanks.\""\n\nShe went so far as to explain to me privately that \""If we stained the mattress, which with your wife could happen once a month, it will void your warranty.\""\n\nYeah.  \n\nI guess with furniture sales the stakes are high.  And perhaps this establishment gives premium incentive to their salespeople to pitch accessories.  That's cool, but a polite \""No thanks\"" a couple of times should be enough to decline.  Going the extra mile to make for a sale by making over-the-line statements, especially when I'm already making a large purchase, shouldn't be part of the game.  \n\nSo much so, that I'm not interested in returning.\n\nEdit:  As it turns out, the mattress was defective and I had it replaced under warranty.  We decided to upgrade mattresses and they allowed us to use the return as a credit.  Our salesperson was much less aggressive and was very friendly and helpful during our buying process.  Was pleased with our second experience.  I have upgraded the rating accordingly.",1

Unlike Sam's Club, Whole Foods gives samples that actually taste delicious and almost make you grab for seconds when instead you just grab an actual wrapped portion of the product (darn, had to buy some sometime).\n\nOn a 'grocery store' level, this Whole Foods gets 5 stars that's for sure.

Most are under a fiver!\n\n- A strong accessory range, including loads of affordable, high quality \""Gummy\"" headphones.\n\nSo really, there is a whole lot to love. When I say DVD's are dirt cheap, I mean many are a fiver, and loads are 3 quid meaning it's cheaper to buy one than rent out a video store. They host cult classics and many manga and world cinema offerings. Their stock is well ordered and the store layout makes sense. Almost all films turn up in here at some point. Their CD range is extensive, catering to all tastes for affordable prices. Their new release CD's sit alongside reviews, either made by the staff or quoted out of magazines. Their books are so affordable you can take a chance and buy something you know nothing about on a limb. They make the classics and cult favourites accessible, cool and affordable to kids.\n\nThere is no other way to say it. I'd marry Fopp if it was legal.",4

review_488027,shopping,"WOW! This is an awesome Mexican Market!\nWe roamed around and found everything we needed, and a little bit more we did not know we wanted. Love it! \n\nThe produce department rocks, the meat department is truly meat-tastic! And yes, you may see some stuff you would never buy...Like beef brains. But there is plenty you would! Ribs, steaks, marinated beef, yum! \n\nThere is just so much yummy stuff here! You will love it!\n\nMy words of wisdom...don't go if you are in a hurry. The store is giant, and you will want to explore. And when you get the cashier they are definitely not in a rush. My BF calls this \""mexican time\"" I just call it slow...but well worth the wait!",3
review_48047,shopping,Nasty customer service today. Asked a simple question on where to find an item and had an eye rolling complacent sales woman point to an obscure location. When I asked for more specifics because I still was unable to find the item the two sales women snickered and made jokes about me behind the counter. I have been shopping here for years and have never been treated like this.,1
review_251409,shopping,Horrible customer service. The employees seem to be lost when you ask them a question.  They stand around and chat with each other about  personal things and give no respect to the costumer.  I had a very uncomfortable experience at this store and others.  good luck best bye,0
review_404575,shopping,"Oh F&E - how you have broken my heart!  This was my favorite place to shop for the past year.  After being taken over by another grocery store chain, the store has gone downhill.  From higher prices on almost everything in the store (the dinners I used to purchase for weekly dinners went up on average $1 per!  It's a meal under 300 calories - there's hardly any food in the bow!  How can you justify that increase!)  The quality of the produce is now shockingly bad.  I used to be able to have fresh bananas and spinach last all week - not now.  The bananas are brown and spotted and questionable by Wednesday.  And finally, today I purchased a bean and cheese dish and apparently someone forgot to add cheese!  Ugh.  Like I said, I used to love this store!  This was my main grocery store and I purchased 5 nights of dinners for me and my boyfriend.  Not anymore.  Time to find a new store.  \n\nI will say that despite all the changes, the employees still remain the most helpful an friendly of any store you can shop at.",0
