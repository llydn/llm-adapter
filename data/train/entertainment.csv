review_245366,entertainment,"The lake is fun and large enough to spend a few hours exploring. The folks at the marina are friendly, helpful and a pleasure to work with. Enjoy renting a boat or house boat",3
review_161915,entertainment,"This hotel is far better looking from the outside. The casino floor isn't very inviting, nor was I impressed with the buffet. That's all I have to say about that.",1
review_375522,entertainment,"This hotel is SOOOO beautiful, I didn't stay there but I shopped and gambled here a little and I just want to COMPLIMENT on what a WONDERFUL and cool casino and regular hotel staff they have here. They were so nice and funny, trying to teach us the rules of the tables and such. \n\nI also really love how much things they have in this hotel to do. and also how just in general beautiful and clean and upscale feeling this place was. I think I want to stay here next time I am in Vegas. I feel like I wont have to travel much since this hotel has shopping, restaurants, a casino and club!! =) \n\noverall, i think the average hotel stayer or tourist wont be disappointed here!",3
review_572004,entertainment,"So, so loud. You've gotta put some effort into your yelling if you want others to hear you. It's a very small venue with the niche of a west-valley-dive-bar type of clientele--old guys listening to young guys attempt to play hard rock. \n\nOkay, the bands were okay I guess. I just don't understand how such a small crowd of people can stand there so calmly while these performers are shredding as hard as they can. There's a bar inside with all the essentials, but drinkers were definitely in the minority. \n\nThis place was not very fun. \n\nBut at least it was competent. Security was cool, and I could just play billiards if I got too bored with the show. Nothing about this place inspires me to return, but as a decent supporter of local arts that treated me well, I can't give it anything lower than a three.",2
review_6621,entertainment,The Discovery Place exceeded our expectations. We heard about this and decided to check it out on our way out of town. There is soo much to see that it's a little overwhelming. Our kids are on the younger side (5 and 3) and can't read yet so some of the science things they didn't get or understand. The staff is very helpful and willing to help you with the experiments. We loved the little kid area where we could put our baby down so she could explore too! Cafeteria and parking is over priced but the cost of admission is totally worth it. Be prepared to spend at least 4 hours wandering around. Great museum! We will be visiting again!,4
review_48072,entertainment,"I've visited Angels' home away from home, also known as Tempe Diablo Stadium, a few times, most recently two weeks ago.  The ballpark certainly serves its purpose, but the facility is not nearly as nice as the other ballparks in the area.\n\nWe came here for a Dodgers/Angels game on a Monday afternoon.  The game was sold out, and all the parking spots were taken loooooong before the first pitch.  We showed up at 11:30 for a 1 pm game, and we were forced to park in a parking lot of a corporate building far, far away.  Walking back to the stadium, we had to, ahem, dodge cars and scalpers, which wasn't exactly an R&R type of activity.\n\nOnce inside the stadium, I felt much better.  Let's face it, there are worse places to be on a Monday afternoon.  We had seats just to the left of 3rd base, 5 rows up.  I was surprised that such good seats were not seats at all.  They were bleacher benches with back support.  There was hardly any legroom at all, and when someone needed to get through, it was an adventure in itself.  The concourses are also very small and crowded, so getting concessions or walking to the bathroom is no picnic, either.\n\nI like how the ballpark is designed to look like a mini Angel Stadium, complete with giant red letters \""A\"" and the view of the mountains to the left and the freeway in centerfield.  The ushers at Tempe Diablo Stadium are also among the most lenient and friendliest in all of Cactus League.  Well done!",2
review_2586,entertainment,"We are so lucky to have such an amazing theater community in Pittsburgh.  This unique theater adds so much to the mix!  It's a fantastic theater because they focus on plays, usually with one musical in the mix. There's new works here, like the original show The Chief, about what else, but Pittsburgh Steelers founding owner Art Rooney.  They bring in the classics like A Midsummer Night's Dream and The Important of Being Earnest.  They also have newer works right off Broadway, like The Rabbit Hole and Superior Donuts.  Plus, they bring in Second City every year, which is big in my book because they've spawned a couple SNL cast members!! \n\nI absolutely LOVE the theater!  I'm a big fan of a theater in the round.  That means there's seating on 3 sides of the stage.  They've also been able to do some really cool things with the stage/set, like making an actual pool for the show Metamorphoses.  My favorite all time show was The Secret Letters of Jackie and Marilyn, which was a world premiere.  The show was about a made up relationship between the two women where they wrote letters to each other.  It was a VERY cool concept! \n\nThey also do a lot of great events like the Mix at 6 for young professionals before a show.  Plus, they understand that most of us under 26 (and of course sometimes above) are broke ho's, they offer $15 tickets!  The great thing is, there's really not a bad seat in the house! \n\nAgain, we have a fantastic theater district, so TAKE ADVANTAGE and go here!  Don't make me tell you twice!!",4
review_201227,entertainment,"I love this place. The moment you walk in, it's like you've been transported to a tropical place. The first part is pretty interesting. Once you get to the underwater tunnel, in my opinion, the fun begins. It's like you're part of the underwater fun. The touch pool filled with sting rays and horse shoe crabs is great. The best thing about Shark Reef is the sunken ship, where you can see tons of sharks, a few sea turtles, and one huge ray. I was able to see a couple of employees dive while I was there. This is a must do for anyone who is visiting Las Vegas. Yes the price is a bit much, but I feel like you can get your moneys worth there.",4
review_601010,entertainment,Joker of clubs is a good place to chill have fun with people and has a great atmosphere good place to play games make new great friends and have some amazing hookah with all different kinds of flavors and mixes that they have not only on the menu but also what the employees can come up with. Great music too all from hip hop to country and even edm. Every one here are friendly happy and when time comes or right ready to party. Amazing customer service!!! One place I will for sure go back to!! Karaoke Thursdays game nights Sunday movie night Mondays and much more great atmosphere for sure.,4
review_232569,entertainment,"We stayed here for a little \""staycation\"" over the weekend. We had plans for Saturday so we stayed only Friday night. \n\nI called to see if there was a way we could check in early. (Normal is 4pm) since we had Friday off and they said as long as the room was ready , but we could also use the facilities as we waited. IE Pool \n\nWe got there about 11am and the room was ready. We had a mountainside suite. It was a king bed and a fold out couch. The room was large enough for the 4 of us and was decorated nicely. The bed was very comfortable and the fold out was decent too. \n\nSince parking is hard to come by on a crowded weekend we had the staff shuttle us to the pool and back. The grounds are on the side of a mountain and it was too hot to walk. \n\nThe Falls pool area is large, with plot of seating/lounging, a bar/cafe, a waterslide and a huge play pool with a volleyball net strung across. \n\nThe waiter was quick with our drink orders and kept them full. The prices are a little steep but it is a resort. \n\nThe youngest had a good time in the lower falls area, sang karaoke and everything. \n\nWe had a great time and would come back again.",3
review_388378,entertainment,"Saw Divergent tonight at the Galaxy located on the Cannery property.  Three problems with today's experience:\n\n1). The online ticket purchasing system does not work on IOS devices.  (iPad, etc.). Mentioned it to the two \""management looking\"" individuals working the desk.  RESPONSE:  \""oh yeah...we know about that.  I think we are working on a fix.\""  Me \""you may want to let folks know who are trying to purchase online\"". RESPONSE:  \"" glazed look in their eyes....\""\n\n2). Watched the movie Divergent in theater #2 and about 20% of the screen was a different color than the rest of the screen.  It was show center at the 12 o'clock perspective of the client.  Mentioned it to the two representatives at the desk.  RESPONSE:  \""oh yeah...we know about that.  We plan to get it fixed at some point.\""  Me: \""it was kind of distracting watching the movie....\"".\n\n3). I also had two Chatty Cathies next to us.  No flow through of ushers to check on the audience.  Mentioned in to the representatives.  RESPONSE:  \""glassy eyed look....\""\n\nThe Cannery is a nice property.  The Galaxy has a lot of potential.  There are choices in Vegas....I recommend you up the customer service angle as this customer may make an alternative choice next time.",1
review_29699,entertainment,This was a lot of fun but the only downfall was it started raining and the water came in through the roof making puddles on the floor causing our karts to skid and crash into other karts!! We didn't really get to finish racing but it was definitely a lot of fun playing bumper cars since you cant do that normally.,3
review_83149,entertainment,"Here fans can find sports bar food, done in an ordinary fashion.  Television viewing was well thought out, even if the food is not.  You can literally see a TV no matter what seat you are in. I can't say I've ever been to a sports bar with good food.  Maybe it's too much to ask to want to watch the world cup and have a decent meal.",1
review_229222,entertainment,"This casino is g-h-e-t-t-o, but the main draw of this place is for the fried Twinkies and Oreos (or as the lady helping me called it...an order of heart attack). The line moved extremely SLOW with three people behind the counter taking their sweet time - two helping with the food and 1 at the cashier. \n\nI seriously felt disgusted while waiting in line just seeing all the greasy food (not that I'm opposed to it), but it was obvious why this place was a hit with the above average weight crowd. Also, the area was filthy (the guy cleaning the tables just wiped the food onto the ground). The guy behind me and myself both had tissue stuck to our shoes at one point.\n\nAside from the ghetto casino, the nastiness of the restaurant, and the long wait, the fried twinkies and oreas were damn good!",1
review_481718,entertainment,"Loved it! The dinosaur exhibits are great. I wanted EVERY GEM in the gem room. Hey, Carnegie family, how about giving me that diamond and platinum bracelet? Even a loaner would be fine. The discovery room is comfortable and friendly, and we got to pet a stuffed (dead) bear. We saw lots of stuffed (dead) animals, the camel tableaux is shocking. It reminded me of the California Academy of Science in SF, the way it was before they remodeled and screwed it all up. If I'm back in Pittsburgh, I'd go back again. It's kid friendly, people friendly, and a beautiful museum.",4
review_180474,entertainment,"Great place!\n\nHotel-wise, they had everything you'd need and looked great!\n\nWhat I really want to talk about is there pools!!!!  We started at the lazy river one and must have went around in circles for an hour before it got a bit crowded.  Then we headed to the wave pool which is the largest and had a blast just hanging out in there before heading to the super shallow pool to the side (roughly a foot deep) and just sipped on some drinks for a while.  Such a blast!  We almost said screw the plans, lets just stay here!\n\nWasnt so crazy about the crowd  though :(  We tried to find a chair to put our stuff down on, but couldnt find even one.  So we ended up grabbing food at the beach grill place right there and it was not very good at all !  Kinda bummed us out even.  Thankfully that was before we went in the pools so the day turned around.  If you go to the pools, go early!",3
review_184213,entertainment,"I had been here once or twice before.  On those trips I didn't have a negative experience, but it wasn't a good one either.\n\nThe first thing you should know about my most recent trip (and what will be my last) is that someone got stabbed in the crowd.  This is the fault of the venue.  Security is a joke.  When entering I watched multiple go inside after the metal detector wand had beeped.  The overcrowding in the General Admission area certainly didn't help the matter.\n\nDue to the stabbing, security (and later police) roped off an area of about 15 square feet due to it being a crime scene.  This of course didn't help any of the crowding concerns.  The blood puddle was left untouched which is important for the crime scene, and we should be able to continue the show right?  Nope, after 2 or 3 more songs the concert was ended early.\n\nThe ticket prices are ridiculous at this venue ($60 after fees for general admission).  It's even worse knowing that the concert still had at least 30 more minutes.  Not only did I feel unsafe because of this venue, but they also essentially stole $20-$30 from me.\n\nEDIT: One employee has contacted me through yelp regarding this review and apologized for my bad experience.  I appreciate it.  I have also sent some letters to some managers and directors as well.  I will try to update further if anything happens.  All that said, the review will remain at 1 star as that was my experience of the venue.  It would take a lot to get me to return and re-evaluate my rating.  I would not re-evaluate without actually returning.\n\nEDIT2: House of Blues has responded to my letter and has sent me a gift card to compensate for my bad experience.  I'm very happy that they responded to my complaints.  Hopefully soon I'll have an updated review and a much better experience to share.",0
review_236473,entertainment,"I love Caesars palace!! but I gave them one less star because the walk to the different towers are quite ridiculously long lol. I stayed in the palace tower. But other than that, I love the location of the hotel! Right in the middle of all the fun!",3
review_161571,entertainment,"I stayed there this weekend with the date and we had a really good time. I did the upgrade, and they gave us this great room with a spa tub, and everything about it was pretty clean (one of the chairs had a slightly noticeable stain on it, but that's all). The room was huge, probably larger than we should have stayed in, but it was fun.\n\nI actually enjoyed coming here with her, especially since I'm kind of tired of coming to Vegas and got to see it with someone who isn't tired of it. Paris is about the right size for one of these theme casinos -- not too large, not too small -- so it's easy to walk around and conveniently located across the street from the Bellagio and their water show for the turistas.\n\nSome of the restaurant choices are kind of weird (outside of the Eiffel Tower restaurant, which really isn't French, there isn't a French restaurant here), but for the most part it's a fun place. \n\nThe coolest part is some of the random music acts they have off the casino -- very classy and elegant for a place that doesn't always have a classy and elegant crowd.",3
review_365938,entertainment,"Holy fucking amazeballs! it was a toss up if my friend and I were going to see Tiesto or Avicii that night in LV and just so happened that one of my friends that lives there said they were going to XS. Easy decision there. Got to the Wynn and found out that the event was being hosted by none other than Mr. Olympia himself, Mr. Phil Heath! Cover was $75 to wait in line, or $100 to skip the line. I didnt feel like waiting in line, fuck it. Get inside and theres gratuitous amounts of T & A rubbing up on you because its packed like a sardine can! the DJ was on stage pumping up the crowd, beats liberating the women dancing on tables, strip pole platforms, dancefloor, and even in the pool. The line for the bar was forever and a day...if you were a bitch about it...and prices were typical Las Vegas ridiculousness. made it from the indoor part of the club to the outdoor part between Wynn and Encore where there was a little more room to move around, dance, and mingle with the other clubbers. Didnt get smashed drunk like some people there, not baller enough like that, but thoroughly enjoyed my night with a lot of beautiful people in an environment that can only be described as electric! my wallet can definitely wait to go back, but I for one cant wait for my next adventure at XS.",4
review_574091,entertainment,"4 stars for the ambiance, 2 stars for the food. I loved the fact that the games here are free and the place has a cool vibe. I ordered the teriyaki chicken wings.  It didn't seem very fresh even though they used a good quality product. The wings were also caked in a very thick, ultra sweet sauce. The drinks are reasonably priced and served cold. The music here is a little bit weird, kinda like stuff they play at Pure or The Bank. What is really great is that all the games here are free. If I was 10 years old I would probably be peeing in my pants. I mean, I am able to beat the ol school X-men game! If I tried to do that at a regular arcade, it would probably cost me 20 dollars in quarters! I might return here for the games and drinks but wouldn't come back here for the food.",2
review_12509,entertainment,"An absolute treasure in downtown Champaign. A 150-foot screen that shows classic films monthly in their original frame size. I've seen Casablanca, Butch Cassidy & The Sundance Kid, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Top Gun, Rear Window and many other films there. They have great concessions, cheap tickets, and an original Wurlitzer organ. \n\nThe Virginia is also becoming Roger Ebert's personal project and he holds his film festival there every April. It's a great experience if you ever get the chance and the movies he picks are always awesome, but overlooked films.",4
review_613832,entertainment,I am totally enjoyed my time at P.P's. I really like how they provide the wine and other treats. The instructor was great & the staff at P.P's were very welcoming. I would definitely would go back for another painting session.,4
review_617893,entertainment,"We enjoyed this tour last weekend.  Here's a few comments to help you decide whether or not to do it:\n\nBooking was easy on their website.\n\nMeet up location was not inside as stated on the instructions after booking.  Instead, we met outside in the freezing cold (Vegas is in the 30's/40's right now) with the wind blowing hard.  Disappointing.  Then, the guide started the tour by giving us some history/trivia about Vegas (very cool) but he did it in our outdoor meeting area which was right under a blaring speaker of music that is piped in the outdoor area.  Hard to hear him.  10 steps away was a quiet serene place that he could've done this.\n\nTour guide Joel is awesome - very knowledgeable, doesn't go too fast, cares about the group's experience.\n\nWe visited 5 locations and it took 2.5 hours to do so.  That's fine, because nothing dragged on.  The problem is that I was told on the phone and by email that the tour would start at 3p and end at 430p.  I was upset that we were just barely getting to our 5th restaurant at 510pm.  We had somewhere to be at 530pm so we had to leave the tour early (we tasted the food there first though).\n\nOk - now to the food.  AMAZING, except for our last stop.  All stops had plentiful tasting portions and by the end we were full - a perfect early dinner!  The first 4 stops were absolutely delicious, and fun too.  The manager/host at each restaurant was clearly proud of their work and happy to share info with us about what we were eating, how it's made, etc.  The 5th/last stop was pizza - and it was gross.  Yuck.  My husband and I agree it was the greasiest pizza we had ever eaten....the crust was soaked in it it was that bad.  Yuck again.  Shocking that this stop was included because the first 4 stops were outstanding, using high quality ingredients and techniques.  Yuck on the pizza.  Ok - I think I've got that out of my system now.\n\nOverall - we'd happily sign up for this tour again the next time we're in Vegas....even if it means hearing the same spiel from each restaurant manager and tasting the same food because it was that good.  Oh - except for the pizza....we'd skip the last stop.  And now that we know the tour will last until 530p and it meets outside, we would be better prepared.",3
review_119791,entertainment,"Pro: You can gamble (slots) in this airport when there is a delay.\nCon: You can lose money in this airport when there is a delay.\n\nPro: Several food options are spread throughout the terminal.\nCon: None of these places are places I really want to eat at.\n\nPro: The airport is so close to the Strip that you think you might be landing on the Strip during approach.\nCon: It's still a $40 cab ride from the airport to the Strip.\n\nPro: Vegas knows how to handle a line efficiently.\nCon: Lines for everything are long.\n\nSo, it's not the worst airport I've ever flown into, but it isn't exactly awesomesauce either. However, the excitement when you land is palpable, just as the hangovers on departures are.",2
review_130090,entertainment,"This Casino may be on the strip, but not really.  It's just close enough to the actual strip for you to temp the walk, but beleive me the walk back from the strip (after a bit of alcohol) is not worth it.  \n\nThe noise in Hotel is too much to bare and the ones making the noise don't have the excuse of being drunk (they're kids).  So basically you have to deal with brats the whole night.\n\nNext time I'm in Vegas I will not be staying at Circus Circus and the only reason I gave it 2 stars is that it is better than a flea bag motel, but only slightly.",1
review_332747,entertainment,Interesting underground facility on the St-Laurent Main street.  My first time in that place for the Yelp Montreal - Bouge Bash event and I thought that it was interesting.  Could be a nice place for experimental theatre or a small band concert.,2
review_306053,entertainment,"The facilities are very nice. For someone not into competitive karting or introducing others into karting this may be a good place. You'll want something better if you know how to drive and expect a competitive environment.\n\nThe track layout is pretty good but exceptionally narrow. It makes it difficult to pass, except for when the attendant blue flags.\n\nThere isn't a lot of really fantastic karting in this area, but I can't imagine wanting to return here. It's a bit on the expensive side and provides such a sterile and predictable experience that it isn't really any fun.\n\nAdditionally, the timing loop obviously has some problems. They claim the track is .25 miles, but the best time of the week were around 15 *seconds*. So, people are averaging around 60 miles per hour? Not likely. Small nit, but I try to post times on the board and that's just another annoyance.\n\nThere is another karting place near by that I've been to probably 10 times and will continue to be my standard place to go (not naming it in the interest of fairness).\n\nBottom line: If you value cleanliness, modern registration and a sterile experience this is the place to go. If you want to put in hot laps at a place that allows good competition, head elsewhere.\n\n2 very opinionated stars because it simply isn't for me, but others may really like it.",1
review_302458,entertainment,"I've gone to the Glendale location several times over the past 2-3 years. I've also been to their Mesa location, but not in 5 years.\nI go to watch WWE pay-per-view. At least 5 times a year. I haven't tried it any other time. There's always a good crowd for wrestling events. We have fun.\nO'Sullivans is large and has plenty of seats. Lots of TVs of various sizes. Bar is well-stocked. I love Black & Tans (Guinness and Bass). They don't sell Bass, so I settle for Smithwick's, a BlackSmith. \nGood food selection. I typically don't experiment with food, I order what I know I'll like. Their meatloaf and shepherd's pie is great. Ribs are o.k. Nacho platter is loaded.\nOnly problem that I've had, and this has happened on 3 different occasions, is waitress service. First time, during a period when there wasn't a lot of customers around me, I waited 20 minutes to be served. And that was after I notified the manager. He gave me a free drink. Second time, it took 10 minutes. A few weeks ago it happened again. It was very busy and I waited about 8 minutes. Plus waitress brought me the wrong sized drink. \nI'll continue to go to R.T.

review_217432,entertainment,"This was the best club in Vegas!  It's so sad that it was sold.  Found a couple of negative reviews not surprising; as if your typical broke ass douche bag brigade, bitching about the price of cover would like a high end strip club like Scores.  Not likely.",4
review_390109,entertainment,"The music was the draw of the show by far. The skits were cute and hot. Holly Madison only makes small short visits on stage so if you are going solely to check her out, you will not be satisfied. When she is on stage she is so cute skipping about. She is slender yet jiggly at the same time, love that! Beautiful women in this show as well. I would see it again but bext time get VIP seating.\n\nMy milkshake brings all the guys to the yard...yes I want a milk bath!\n\nWARNING: IF ATTENDING THIS SHOW MAKE SURE YOU GET VIP ONLY!

review_16174,entertainment,"As if the Sonoran Desert wasn't weird enough with all its threatening vegetation, well, it just got a whole lot weirder.\n\nThere's blown glass littered throughout the garden's exhibits, each of the works mimicking a type of cactus. Strange but beautiful.\nAlso featured is live music, Apache storytellers, poets, and some guy who figured out how to make music out of a bunch of clay pots. \n\nBeverage stations are also littered throughout the garden. Making the whole event somewhat tolerable, given how it was more important for my wife to blow-off the ASU, UofA game and take our lingering Thanksgiving guests to some kind of bullshit ooh and ahh fest.\n\nOnce I was there, I got into to it, but I did have to be coerced. \nGlad I did.\n\nHere's a pic.",4
review_258792,entertainment,"They have live music occasionally.  It's a small room so it's obviously various local acts.  I happened to see a beatles cover band composed of high school students.  They were pretty good actually.\n\nThe food I've seen is pretty sub par.  I got a pizza once, it was thin and greasy.  Hot wings were really wet if I recall correctly.  Don't go here for the food.\n\nThe bar is in a separate area, thus the show I went to was an all-ages show which is nice.  Even though I'm well over 21 years old, I remember when I wasn't.  Its a shame to miss out on music because others are drinking.",2
review_430750,entertainment,"The MIM is very  impressive. Gorgeous building, great layout, an amazing amount of instruments and info. Downstairs they had features on mechanical instruments (instruments that don't need a person to play), artist features (Lennon, Clapton, Dick Dale, etc.), guitars, and an interactive section where you can play some instruments. Upstairs is where is gets impressive. There are 196 countries on this planet and 193 are represented in this museum as well as certain territories with specific cultures. Each country has it's own section with a plaque of info, musical instruments from that country, a flat screen with footage of people playing music from there with a censor that detects your audio guide and automatically plays it. Awesome! The only possible negative would be that it can be overwhelming, but slow down and just walk by each region and your audio guide will play you a piece.",3
review_239527,entertainment,"This place is so horrible. My friends and I waited for about 30 minutes to be seated, then another 20 to get our hookah. On hip hop night, it seems like there are 16 year old girls dancing on the walls. It's so ridiculous. This place smells absolutely terrible. I don't know how people out here in Nevada do hookah out here.. But being from Southern Cali, our hookah lounges are 1 million times better.",0
review_614396,entertainment,"This was a tougher hike than I expected but not THAT difficult.  We took the train up from London the night before and stayed in a bed and breakfast in Leith.  Someone had suggested we check out Arthur's Seat while we were in Edinburgh, so we left the B&B, determined to find our way on foot.  Little did we know that we were over 4 miles away, so it turned into a little bit of an adventure.  \n\nWe eventually got ourselves headed in the right direction, and once we got to the top, we scarcely got a few good pictures before the rain started pouring down on us.  We almost killed ourselves trying to get back down (how was this harder than hiking up???), and by the time we got to the bottom, we were completely drenched.  It was AMAZING and so worth it though.  The view of Edinburgh from the top of Arthur's Seat is one of the most incredible ones I have ever seen.  \n\nIf you're here, you HAVE to go.  Just make sure to have the proper gear for the weather and the terrain!",4
review_277926,entertainment,"Meh, used to be better. Crowded, crappy parking, long lines everywhere. A port a potty here and there (nowhere near enough).

review_137425,entertainment,"I actually came here to do some quick shopping at the gift store and was going to stay for dinner but the line was way too long to eat dinner and make it to the club before the guest list closed. \n\nRainforest cafe is definitely a family dinner spot, the restaurant is decorated like a rainforest with a large tank full of exotic fish to wow the children. Their gift shop is pretty cool too but its full of kids stuff with limited items for adults.",2
review_290865,entertainment,"This show was ok. The girls danced their butts off and I kept thinking wow this is a lot of cardio these girls are doing. I only found one really attractive. She had a european sexy look to her with natural breasts. Another one was flatter than ihop pancakes and yet another one had hard, fake boobs. I was enjoying the dancing but then this horrible female comedian came on. She started making jokes about how the crowd was not laughing or having fun. I kept thinking if you want us to laugh say funny stuff. Then she started just being vulgar towards people and not in a funny way. I walked out for awhile because she was getting really annoying. I came back later to finish watching the show and it was entertaining. I was given some free tickets so I wasnt too picky but I cant imagine paying 60 bucks or so to watch this.",2
review_170802,entertainment,"I think the Luxor needs an update. I don't find it especially attractive inside. Just think of what they could do to the appearance of the hotel room windows to improve the view when you look up inside the pyramid. I can't believe its still so plain and unadorned. The outside of the Luxor draws you in, only to be disappointed by the been-there-done-that interior.  \n\nI have yet to stay in one of the rooms and would like to do that, as the slanted walls and view of the inside of the building would make it interesting, but other than that, there's nothing special about the Luxor. Sure the old Egyptian motif was cheesy, but what does it have now? No personality!",1
review_157927,entertainment,"Came here for a party upstairs and had a good time.  I was really impressed with the ambiance of the upstairs, the furniture however looked nasty.  I don't want to think of everything that happened on those sofas over the last 40 years.\nWe just had some appetizers which were good and the service was very friendly.  I think it is a good location for a big get together.  They let us take over the tv and music and were very patient and kind.",2

We ride the train, then the carousel and after playing in the playground we visit the model train museum.  They have so many model trains in this air-conditioned area.  My kids go up and down the different aisles.  It is a great  and inexpensive way to spend a morning or afternoon with your kids.",4

review_443298,entertainment,"These guys are full service. I initially hired All Night to provide DJ for our wedding reception at Carmine's. That quickly expanded and All Night provided up lighting for the room and light show for dancing as well as photographer. As I wanted to up the game for all the guests coming such a distance to attend our reception, I added All Night's showgirls to appear for cocktail hour and Elvis for a dinner show. I can't even rave enough about it all!!!! The showgirls set the mood.. They were classy (long dresses) and absolutely gorgeous women.. every guest wanted photos with them and those girls were all over Facebook within minutes.. So cute! Sat for dinner, where Josh did a nice job with music, and then the grand entrance by Elvis. Elvis was the biggest hit of the evening!!! He's a true professional, great voice and look and got everyone engaged in the party and even hung around for photos.. so fantastic!\nI did all these arrangements long distance through email and all was so easy and all of the above was confirmed and arrived on time (or early.)..totally stress free!! I had the best wedding reception ever!",4
review_104747,entertainment,"I have to say that while the band I saw at Prankster Too's Jester Room was fantastic, the venue I was not all that fond of. Mind you, I can only really comment on the Jester Room as that is where I spent my entire visit.\n\nI think my biggest issue was the layout. It's longer than wider, which isn't really appropriate for a music venue. While we decided to grab bar chairs and move ourselves up in the middle of it, I'm sure people in the bad could not see the band at all. In my opinion, that ruins a small intimate show. \n\nAdditionally, the service was slow. The waitresses seemed to get confused and it took us a good half hour after we sat down before anyone stopped by to see if we would like anything. \n\nI'd go there if the band was worthwhile, but that is pretty much it.",1

review_435481,entertainment,"Yes, this place is brand new and super classy and hip, but the service is HORRIBLE!  I went here to see The Strokes at the Chelsea, and first of all, no one knew where the venue was.  We must have asked at least 3 different employees and no one knew, or they gave us false information, and the first guy we asked was super rude and condescending.  Once inside the venue, we waited forever for the show to start.  We waited for hours for the musicians to come on, and not only that but there were several fights that broke out in the pit area, and the staff did nothing to stop them!  They merely looked on from the outside and pretended they couldn't tell who the culprits were.  They were incompetent at best.  The musicians played an amazing show, but I would definitely not return to this venue again.",1

review_405077,entertainment,"AGGRESSIVE BOUNCERS!\n\nThe place would be a nice hangout if it weren't for the overly aggressive security guards.  My wife and I were hanging out with a couple of friends this weekend.  We were pretty much keeping to ourselves at the patio and hand one of these power hungry jerks decided we had to leave.  He asked me wife if she was ok while we were seated at a table.  She turned to him and said yes and went back to her conversation.  He said 'you're out of here\"" for no good reason.  I said hold on, what's the problem so I had to go too. The guy did everything he could to antagonize me, too.  After starting a loud argument with the little jerk, he got his bouncing buddies to quickly rush us out of the door with no explanation.  They were really aggressive about it, and pretty much pushed the ladies out.  My wife tripped while they were rushing us out and actually fell in the pool.  This guy was just a GOON looking for trouble and using his pay nothing job as an excuse to exert his minimal authority.  And from the other reviews on Yelp, this is not rare for this place..  BEWARE OF THESE BOUNCING LOSERS!\n\nAlso, when I managed to get the waitress to come over so I could pay our bill, she said this was pretty typical for the bouncers and rolled her eyes.\n\nWell, they just lost a customer.

It's also near a pretty sketchy area though things are being done to try to improve the area. \n\nThe interior isn't too bad considering the age of the property and with the things to do high up in the tower, it's too bad you have to pay to get up otherwise it would probably be busier. The tower that is.\n\nI didn't stay in the rooms so from what I was able to see from the parking structure to the tower, management is doing a decent job of drawing people there.

review_324673,entertainment,"LOVE this theater!!  I've been coming here since it opened. They do a lot of business yet you rarely have to wait long in lines to buy tickets or concessions. \nThey have a coffee/ice cream bar, video arcade and a restaurant. You can take the food from the restaurant into the theater. You can even take drinks from the restaurant bar into the movies. They have RSVP seats that are bigger and made of leather. We've splurged for them a few times but their regular sits are roomy and comfortable. \nI became a STUBS member which is a nice bonus. You earn points for buying movie tickets and any food or drinks. Every $100 you spend you get $10 in rewards. For our family it doesn't take us long to add up points. Sometimes I cash in my points for gift cards and give them as gifts. Plus you get discounts or upgrades at the concession stand. You also get to preview movies at times which is pretty cool. If you go a lot you should definitely take advantage of it. \nWe've never had a bad experience. The theater sits in an area (The Waterfront) that is inbetween a poor neighborhood and a wealthy neighborhood so the movie goers are made up of all kinds of people. \nIt's a cool place for families, friends, or date nights.",4

The wait staff in general were charming, funny, helpful, no stress. The pool tables looked like they were in good shape, with enough space between them to feel relaxed and comfortable. Several extra large booths line the wall, and a few partially closed Asian-inspired seating areas line the back for more intimate dining. I didn't try the food but the white brick walls, cozy couches, strong drinks and nice staff make me inclined to give a great review.

We went on 2.15.14 for the hearts picture.\n\nThe space is pretty large, but it gets packed. You are literally all jammed in the room and you feel awfully close to your neighbor. It actually was not that bad being so close together though. I would recommend getting there early to stake out a good spot. You save your spot by getting a canvas and setting it down. If you go with a group, make sure you just get their canvases too, so ya'll can sit together!\n\nThe instructor was really helpful. The picture background needed a lot of blending and looked complicated. They are really good at breaking down each step so you don't get confused. She also takes the time to walk around and give different people some tips, which was nice. By the end of the session, I was amazed that my picture did not look like a 5 year old painted it. If you're looking for something different to do in Vegas, I would definitely recommend this place!\n\nMake your reservations early though, because some paintings are really popular. \n\nThe location is actually difficult to find.

review_190921,entertainment,"SPOILER ALERT! Details of the show are in this review, if you don't want to know what happens in Blue Man Group stop reading now! \n\nBut i'm guessing that you'll continue reading because like everyone else, nobody really has any idea what Blue Man Group is about. You're usually thinking, \""Blue people? Music? They don't speak, or something?\"" Without actually seeing the show, the general details about this show are vague. \n\nThe show is (for the purpose of trying to boil it down) a comedy/music show. The three blue men are suppose to represent the internet or how social interaction works in this day in age, or are a representation of our personal insecurities. They all have their own silly mannerisms. and the audience feels safe laughing with them because they're all very curious and act socially awkward. This is the style of comedy you sit through for almost 2 hours, but I can assure you it gets confusing and repetitive very quickly. \n\nThe acts in this show include eating Captain Crunch, eating Twinkies, and eating Marshmallows. These are 3 different scenes that each last at least 10-15 minutes a piece. They eat these things while being socially awkward with one another. I swear to god, that's it. Additionally, there is a scene where they show you signs with words on them- and you read them until somebody walks into the auditorium late, at which point they bust those people out with a spotlight and putting them on the big screen. Its just a lot of cheap laughs for a majority of the show. \n\nThere is also a lot of drumming, which takes a certain amount of talent to do... but I'm really reaching to compliment the show when I say that. They drum, and they drum, they hit a few pvc pipes and drum some more. It's kinda 'neat' when they drum over the paint and the paint splashes around, but this is literally all they do they entire show. \n\nThe highlight of the show comes during the grand finale, when the Blue Men pull toilet paper over the audience. The audience is literally entirely covered with toilet paper- but again I can only use the word 'neat' to describe this. It's an exciting rush for about 2 minutes, after sitting through 2 hours of watching them eat food and drumming. \n\nI paid $55 for my ticket via travelzoo, and when I left I felt like I wasted my time... If you do see this show, know that there is NO BAD SEAT in the house, and that the poncho zone doesn't get very wet at all... At the show I went to, the audience wasn't really into it and everyone seemed confused... There was probably a time when Blue Man Group was the hottest show in Vegas, but I think it's time is up... Maybe I'm just out of touch, but this style of comedy/music show just wasn't for me =/",1

Easily one of the best values in Vegas or anywhere else as most of the machines only cost a quarter to play, unlike modern arcade games which can cost a couple bucks per credit.

review_284497,entertainment,"Wow - a lot of negative reviews on here! I'm not in agreement, but I can see the point of view of some of these people, and I think what it comes down to is what you're looking for when you go clubbing in Vegas.\n\nNow in fairness, LAX is not as 'pretty' as other places, like 'Surrender' or 'Pure.' It isn't going to win any points for ambiance, for sure. It's an older club and an older hotel and it looks it. So, those looking for 'fancy' won't find it here. Personally though, the key for me when it comes to clubbing is good music, a decent crowd, and enough room to dance.\n\nLike most Vegas clubs, my girls and I got in free, which was nice. \n\nThe crowd is relaxed and casual. Most of the time when I go out in Vegas I'm in a dress and heels. Here I wore jeans and didn't feel underdressed by any means. It's not the kind of place where you need that 'Vegas' dress. Some on here have said the people at LAX are 'ghetto' and I suppose in comparison with XS and more upscale clubs, LAX could be, by comparison, considered 'ghetto' - but I'm guessing it's people who've never been anywhere NEAR the ghetto who are labeling this place as that. I've been to truly GHETTO clubs in my life and this place wasn't really ghetto. The crowd was fine. Didn't see any guys I wanted to dance with, but that's not a necessity for me to have a good time in a club.\n\nWhat IS a necessity for me in a club is good music and this place DELIVERED. I went with my friends, all of whom grew up through the late-80s to late-90s and we were LOVING the music!! Getting all nostalgic, dancing to songs I haven't heard in a while, yet we ALL still knew ALL the lyrics. I can imagine the 20-year-olds in the club that night were probably hating on all the 'old' stuff the DJ was playing, but the 30-year-olds in there were definitely feeling it. Music I can dance to? Love it. Also a plus is that this place wasn't jam-packed. I actually had room to dance!! Most of the \""popular\"" places on the Strip are so full you can hardly move an inch.\n\nAll-in-all: It may not be anything fancy or ultra-special, but when with my friends, our most enjoyable night out in a club was at LAX. Good music, decent crowd, we danced until our feet couldn't take it anymore.",3

review_333120,entertainment,"I've been to Pointe-A-Calliere twice now.  The first time was with Abigail M., and the second was with my parents.  My hands-down favorite part is the multimedia experience or whatever they call it.  It is totally ridiculous and fabulously informative.  There are parts that are baldly racist (like the bit about the Chinaman with the laundry on the corner) and others that are blatantly sterilized (the Natives might not be happy about these new folks moving in), but I feel that they add to the charm of the whole thing.  The tech parts are impressive, and the experience delivers a ton of information in a very short period of time.\n\nThe rest of the museum is also interesting.  I would not recommend taking one of the free tours that are offered, though.  Maybe we just got unlucky, but I think that the tour might have been the most painful 60 minutes of my life.  Mr. Tour Guide had a peculiar fascination with toilets and chamberpots and told some of the worst jokes that I have ever heard (and since I have to listen to my own jokes, this is saying something).  The only thing that he told us that I found worthwhile was that, in the little 5-part diorama thingy that shows how Montreal changes, they rather hilariously indicated which of the miniature people were English by giving them little umbrellas.\n\nI would recommend just wandering instead.  The museum is very interactive and has a lot of multimedia.  It also has some great stuff for kids.  Honestly, though, part of the reason that I enjoyed this place like I did is that most of it is just plain odd.  The final exhibit (love stories in Montreal or something like that) is the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen in a museum; I think that the curator of that portion was probably stoned when (s)he came up with the idea.  The hologram people who tell you about living in Montreal back in the day are absurd.  A fair number of the representations of or information given about Natives is probably slightly racist and/or insulting.  But the museum delivers an enormous amount of information about the city's multicultural background.  And (at the risk of sounding too much like a grad student) I would imagine that the multimedia approach supports and subscribes to the obvious effort that the museum is making to show Montreal's mixed/diverse background.  \n\nI will probably continue bringing visitors to this museum and possibly will even return without them.\n\nOh, I should add that they are apparently working on expanding the underground portion of the museum to include more of the sewer and other remains.  I don't remember when Mr. Tour Guide said that would pan out, but I imagine that it will take quite a while.",3
review_507428,entertainment,Bring a pair of ear plugs or two.  I was deaf for like 10 minutes after coming out of this place.  Still don't know what all the hypes are about this place seeing there are always a line waiting to get it every Fridays and Saturdays.  The interior space is very small and you can't really dance with anyone in your group.  I'll be staying away from this place for a while before returning there again.,0
review_70788,entertainment,"This place couldn't be more different during the day than at night.\n\nLate night, you can't really beat their food specials, and the service is always excellent on the third shift.\n\nDuring the day and at night however, this place is kind of a drag. They are total nazis about carding people (even those who are obviously 30+) and it gets really annoying. I understand that you can't serve people under 21 but seriously, develop and use some judgment and common sense, and remember your customers, instead of pretending to forget someone. In general, the servers seem intent on finding ways to avoid serving you, rather than trying to help you have a good experience. Perhaps they are so focused on gaming that they view non-gamers as a hassle, if this is the case, they have done a very good job of passively-aggressively making it clear.\n\nThe menu is overpriced and fairly pedestrian, although they do offer really good specials at different times.",1
review_468767,entertainment,"I would normally rather not walk home on Lothian Road at night, not for my own safety, but because I'm not fan of dodging people trying to bottle each other. Lothian Road's also full of chains and strip bars. I mean, nothing against a strip bar, but if I had the choice, I'd rather walk through a park than walk by a strip bar where drunk men have been enjoying themselves more than necessary. \n\nI mean, you're not going to be able to ever avoid Lothian Road and it's not the worst place on earth, but there are definitely better parts of Edinburgh. It'll lead you straight down to the West-End, and is one of the routes you might take to the Farmer's Market on a Saturday. It's also the home of the Odeon and the Filmhouse.",1

review_236984,entertainment,"Polyester.  Yes, its a cheap and durable material, but its uncomfortable and stuffy and makes for giggly fun when someone rocks a 1970's vintage polyester leisure suit.\n\nThe club?  Just as cheap, but uncomfortable and stuffy.  Only, without the fun and giggles.  Regardless of the polyester leisure suits, technicolor afros, or ridonkulously flared jeans...\n\nThe decor is gimmicky and tacky, which would have been a fine fit for the themed nightclub IF it weren't executed so half-@ss...\n\nAt $40 for the \""all you can drink [well-drinks]\"" cover, the ghetto-trashtastic crowd is ALMOST bearable... almost.  For the most part, the same human refuse and deviance found in other clubs can be found here in higher concentration, less pretense, and more desperation.  Ech!\n\nThis is the nightclub for you if... 1) you REALLY need a mix of 70's/80's/90's/00's music, and/or 2) you just CANNOT deal with the bureaucracy of getting into higher-end club.

review_527280,entertainment,"I've been an anime/manga fan for 25 years, and a cosplayer for 20. I'm also a tad snarky in regards to my chosen fandom. So, seeing this new ramen-ya named Anime Ramen, I -had- to give it a shot. I went for lunch and was underwhelmed, sadly. But, i'm a staunch lover of Monta, so my expectations were very high, so there's that.\n \nThe atmosphere is fantastic, if you adore Naruto, and the current anime trends. They blast anime and video game soundtracks, which was fine, but not everyone's cup of tea. The place is trying for a \""maid cafe\"" concept like they have in Japan, but it's a bit lacking. The girls don't wear wig-caps for their head, so their anime-esque wigs look not only low-quality, but VERY messy. They are friendly enough, but seem a bit scared of things, still. My guess is for some, this is their first wait-service job, and it shows.\n\n The food is only average, to me. The gyoza tasted like frozen from a bag, and the tonkotsu ramen was okay, but not as delicious as Monta to me. They give 3, paper-thin slices of bland chashu in the ramen. The one thing I loved about the ramen? The French fried onion straws in it!\n\nBIG props to the fact they serve good boba tea! I got the almond milk tea, and it was delicious! It's good enough that is Tea Planet is busy, i'll gladly stop into here and get my fix.\n\n My thoughts, if you're a parent with a kid hard-core into anime, take them here! You won't starve, and your kid will love the experience. I promise the opening theme to Cutey Honey will get stuck in your head for days, later! ^_^",2

review_524153,entertainment,"After doing researcher on their wed site, I was excited about gathering a group of moms to play at their open gym. I called to get more information about a specific  event and was told they no longer have that event. However, they did still hold an open gym during that time.  So a girlfriend and I arrived at noon and were told very rudely that we were 30 mins early. There was no classes going on at the time and the little kids area was empty. I told them I had just called and was told 12 pm, and even mentioned the event that they no longer have. The front desk staff did not care and told us that we would have to wait. I asked about the event that was on their wed site and was told that I was wrong, even though I had checked before going that day and it was still on there. The second time going, was not any better and they were still extremely rude and very confrontational. This was my third time going and once again the staff was rude, disorganized and did not care about my business. The open gym is a bit pricey and is only a hour and a half, in which they always open the doors late and then want you to stretch for the first 10 minutes. I have a 22 month old son, so he could care less about sitting and stretching. Then they kick you out  10 minutes before its over, and have you walk across the parking lot for a free snack(small bag of goldfish). The option to stay and play for the last 10 minutes is not available and every staff member(all teenagers) told me at one time or another that open gym was now over.  I would not mind the price or the length of time, if the stuff was friendly!! :(",0

review_552042,entertainment,"Laser tag has been making a big comeback in the Vegas Valley over the course of the last few months. Firstly, King Putt Mini Golf put a Laser Force laser tag facility in their latest property in Henderson. And, even more recently, this facility opened up over on West Sahara. \n\nBattle Blast does not disappoint. There are some minor flaws, but I'll get to those later.\n\nThe facility itself is strictly laser tag (no mini golf or anything like that), and they have a few arcade games in the lobby. Nothing too terribly impressive. Would be nice if they got some classic games in as well, it's always nice to have a better selection of games while you wait for for laser tag game to begin.\n\nOne innovation this place has that sets it apart from other laser tag places is that there is actually a \""viewing deck\"" so that non-players can look down on the blacklit laser tag arena. A very cool idea I have never seen at any other laser tag place. \n\nAs far as the actual laser tag playing experience goes, it is an amazing one. The arena is nearly twice as big as the one at King Putt, with tons of rooms and several second floor areas. Interestingly, I found a lot more adults and teens playing here than kids, although there were still plenty of children to be found as well. It was kind of interesting playing a more competitive game against mature individuals who took the game seriously than a bunch of whiny brats that complain every time they get shot. As far as laser tag arenas go, this just might be the best arena I have ever been in. After each game they even pass out score cards, something I haven't seen a laser tag place around here do in a long time. \n\nThe one main issue I have is with the design of the packs/guns. The guns are a weird shape, and they often give you the \""2 hands\"" error message, even if you are using 2 hands. Likewise, the gun is kind of hard to move around due to the design of the cable connecting it to the pack (you really have to try playing here to see what I mean.)\n\nAny flaws here are minor. All things considered I had a great time. The staff are friendly and helpful, and it is an excellent facility that will not fail to please any fan of the game.",3

review_559271,entertainment,"Planning a birthday party for a child can be very stressful in this town, especially once summer arrives. You have to worry about the heat which can limit where you go and if you try to do something new each year, it's pretty easy to hit all of the birthday party places in this town by the time your kid is 7 or 8 and if you have more than one child, forget it! You are almost definitely going to some of those places multiple times! Unfortunately for my son, his birthday is in late June, right before the 4th of July, and everyone is usually out of town. This year, I had his birthday party early so he could invite his whole class before they all disappeared for the summer and I had it at King Putt. Now let me ask this, why do people not RSVP in this town? How are you supposed to plan a party if you don't know who's going to show? You just have to wing it, I guess. And wing it, I did. His whole class was invited and we ended up having 16 kids total and it was fabulous! Our host, Jessica, is without a doubt, one of the most awesomest (not a real word I'm sure but, whatever) people ever! She was super nice and extremely helpful and even got upset when I tried to help her serve food and clean up! She was great with the kids and kept the food and drink coming without me asking for anything! The kids played two games of laser tag and she was in there with the whole group as well. She was on top of it all and cleaned up the room quick as a flash! She even offered to help us bring the presents and leftovers out to the car but that's what hubby and the kids are for-to schlep things for me when my hands are full! Everyone was so nice and so helpful and the kids had a great time. It was the most relaxing party I have ever had for one of my children-and I've had plenty! Jessica made the party seem like an actual party instead of a lot of work for me, which it usually turns out to be.  It even turned out to be less expensive than I thought it would be which was a pleasant surprise. We've decided we will go there more often, just for fun and not just for parties!

They basically tell you to just bring the kids & a cake and they will handle the rest.\n\nThey were very helpful when booking the party and made everything pretty seamless.  When we showed up this morning, we were greeted warmly by our party coordinator, Jessie and she brought us to our party room and explained the setup. \n\nWe had the room for 2 hours, the first hour was basically a play hour where the kids get to enjoy all of the bounce houses, rock climbing and toddler play area.  The second hour we spent in the room where the kids got to enjoy pizza, juice and cake.  Our coordinator was with us for this time and helped serve the food and cake.  There was still time left over and the kids were able to play some more.  The bounce houses were very much age appropriate and they stagger the parties so there's not 50 kids running around rampant all at once.  \n\nFor the money, this place couldn't' be beat.  It was clean, organized and there was plenty of staff to man the equipment and make sure the kids didn't injure themselves.  I read the other reviews and think that you also need to assume some sort of responsibility, especially in a place like this, for your kids safety which should mean taking an active role in helping out.  They have a \""sit down\"" area but I tried to walk around as much as possible to make sure the kids were having fun in a safe manner rather than relying on just the staff.  They also gave my daughter a nice book and picture frame which was signed by all the kids at the party as a nice parting gift.\n\nWe looked at other similar places for our daughters party and found Baxter Bunch Playhouse to be the best value for our money.

I figured the guy was nice and I should check out a new scene. Meh.\n\nThe line was long but it was cool...moved fast. However, the SUPER smoky stuffy feel of Caesars really agitated my allergies. I think it was the low ceilings ...I mean, duh its Vegas...but it was so stuffy and smoky in there that it irked me while waiting in line. \n\nThen once I reached the top of the line, the bouncer doubted that my ID was mine. First off, it WAS! I am 26 years old I do not need to be trying to get in some lame ass club. Second, I don't think bending my ID was going to help if it was fake or not. Then he asked me if I had a credit card on me. Hahahaha. How does that prove if its me? Or if I am \""of age?\"" And, I don't bring my card to the clubs fools, like most ladies with a GOOD MAN...my MAN takes care of my drinks on date night!!! And when I'm with the ladies, I bring cash...so I don't blow it on random high caloried drinks.\n\nI'm from Cali fools..get an ID scanner (our IDs don't look cheap and can be scanned for our info in Cali, or at least a UV LED flashlight. I know, this is Nevada and many people come from out of state...at least invest in the UV LED, they use those in airports. Geez!!!!\n\nOnce I got in there, the club seemed nice... flashy, modern and with tons of rooms and bars. What I liked was there was so many different rooms that catered to different styles of music and when you walked around you can only hear the type of music in your area ...no spill over of the other room's music. The DJ playing EDM + 90's was pretty awesome too! So one star for that. \n\nAlso, the free drinks were vodka only drinks. I didn't care, its just it would of been nice to be told that when the promoter picked me up. He made it seem like all the drinks were free up until 12 AM.

review_200059,entertainment,Small club with a line outside and the cover is too high. There was a wait outside but when we got in the club was probably half full. I know a lot of places do this but it is definitely annoying. Music was good if you like new and old school hip hop. I'd consider this a mid to low level club now compared to the rest.,1

review_495926,entertainment,Pizzas great and it's open late. Perfect for soaking up drinks. Location is good because it's not packed right next to a bunch of other things.

Music album hallway is nice touch to browse while you are waiting in line.,3

review_285161,entertainment,"This place is pretty dope. The building is unique and its employees and volunteers are laid back and informative. I went here to check out the Chuck Amuck: A Legacy of Laughter exhibit and was expecting to pay a admittance fee. But nope, it was free. And I was like, \""kickass\"". So, once I was done reading, looking, and watching all the Cuck Jones stuff I went up to the person who was working as the information/supervisor of the exhibit and said, \""this place is nice, what else do you guys have and do here?' And she filled me in on the whole Wednesday open mic night thing and gave me a flyer of other events going on. I asked if they had a nice theatre and she replied with a, \""why don't you see for yourself and you can decide\"". So she hooked my cousin and I up with a little tour of the theatre and building. I have been meaning to go to one of the open mic nights there since, but haven't gotten around to it being that I'm pretty lazy and all. But overall, Tempe can hold its head up high when it comes to their center for the arts.",3
review_183027,entertainment,"Best place to come check out the view of the strip. Great music, zen-like ambiance, and friendly staff. Per the usual in Vegas, if you're a girl, entrance is most likely free. Prepare to pay $10-$20 if you're coming with your guys. \n\nI went with 2 customers, so we went outside a couple of times to chat without trying to yell over the loud music inside. Highly recommended...this place never disappoints.",3

review_134373,entertainment,"Situated at its original location inside the former Bill's Gamblin' Hall and Saloon.  Just a heads-up, this isn't the same as the rooftop club especially since they have separate means of entry.  This one's underground which can be a little daunting to walk out of afterwards due to the bright sunlight beaming right at you.  \n\nNo line so people are usually chaotically scattered around the entrance.  This is one of those places where actually knowing someone will help you get behind the ropes.  You can, however, get your Benjamins do the talking and get the bouncers' attention.  If you think that'll get you straight through the dance floor, then you're mistaken as everybody, even locals, has to pay for cover charge: $20/ladies and $30/gentlemen.\n\nThis place is usually packed mostly with the crowd from the club upstairs as they desperately survey the dance floor to see who they can persuade to take home for the night.  After that, it gets really weird so make sure you're somewhat inebriated before walking in.  Drinks are actually quite stiff but priced like any others along the strip.  If you need more than liquor to keep the night going, there are usually people going around selling \""illicit substances.\""  With that being said, DO NOT LEAVE YOUR DRINK UNATTENDED as I've seen shady people drop things on random people's booze.\n\nOverall, Drai's After Hours is definitely the best lounge in the valley to keep the party going.  This is a must especially for those visiting Las Vegas for the weekend.  Two different rooms with house in one and hip-hop at the other.  Remember to be safe and enjoy the great ambiance.",4
review_403682,entertainment,"I went here with a group of friends because we were going to a concert there (Metal Elvis, meh). We weren't expecting much but were seduced by the convenience of eating at the same place as the show.\n\nThe first problem was that one person in our group made a reservation online, but they had no record of it when we got there, despite our having a confirmation number. So, we had to wait for a table.\n\nThe next problem is that the Mint Julep I had was probably 90% simple syrup. Truly an awful cocktail (not to mention that the waitress had no idea what kind of bourbon they had).\n\nThe service was slow. Some manager type came by and gave us some kind of locals only frequent member card. Not enough for everyone, mind you. Which was fine by me because I hate that kind of crap. Don't need another card to carry around.\n\nThe group shared a plate of nachos which were OK. Kind of hard to screw up corn chips and cheese, so kudos to the Hard Rock for that.\n\nThe special that night was a portabello mushroom sandwich, which seemed to be a reasonably healthy alternative to everything else on the menu. But it was so slathered in cheese and this obnoxious mayo concoction that it really was as much a greasy, drippy mess as any burger. Came with a salad but most of the \""vegetables\"" were white, so that was a disappointment, let me tell you.\n\nWent in suspecting that the Hard Rock Cafe is nothing more than a tourist trap and everything about it confirmed this suspicion.",0
review_619833,entertainment,"This was an extreme disappointment.  I went with my wife and another couple.  We got in at 10PM and were seated in the back of the house, which normally isn't a bad thing.  Except the venue does not have arena or stadium type, elevated seating.  They are regular, armless chairs organized in rows on the floor.  So the chairs are all at the same level!  I'm 6'2'' tall and my wife is just over 5' tall and could not see a thing!  At least the music is good and loud!  \n\nI feel bad for the girls who looked great and obviously work hard at their craft.  I give a one star rating not for the show, but for the improper venue layout.  I would expect more from any Vegas show, and certainly from the Rio!\n\nShame.",0

The DJ that was there sucked in my opinion but mixed in some pop songs that I liked. The staff is super friendly and they keep that place looking clean! I liked the little \""show\"" they have.

Also, you need to have your AAA card so you can get a free sim ride.  It took my wife and me 3 hours to get through everything.  It is definitely worth going to while you are in Charlotte.",4
review_280854,entertainment,"Spent 4th of July weekend here and loved it.  Read so many good reviews going in that it seemed like it would be a safe bet.  It's definitely a change from staying at every other hotel on the strip, but turned out great.  I've always enjoyed gambling at Bills and stopping in for the cheap alcohol, especially the 99 cent margaritas, and thought it made sense to try staying here.  \n\nThe rates are extremely reasonable.  It is a really quick walk from your room to the strip, so if you need to run back up for something at any point it is very convenient to do so.  You do get use of the flamingo pool which is a huge plus.  That was actually one of the main reasons we did stay at Bills.  That pool in the summertime is worth it.  The rooms itself are fine, nothing special, spacious enough, cleaned before 11 am everyday.  Its a perfect room if you're like me and you use it to simply shower and sleep.  Overall good stay, I would stay here again, and am content with the service and stay.  Also, we never had an issue with strip noise and we're staying on the first floor facing the strip.",3

As a newcomer to Montreal, this was an epiphany - you can just go skating whenever you want! We strapped little \""bob\"" skates onto my toddler's snowboots, dragged our sled on the ice with us, and had many a great day out. After skating and sledding, we'd get some hot cocoa in the cafe upstairs, then trek home to nap. \n\nThinking about it almost makes me wish winter were still here. Almost.",4
review_567193,entertainment,"Very fun experience I must say.  There is really good people watching here because you can be sat right next to the casino floor.  And this is the only place at the Wynn that you can get a decent meal at 3AM (at least I believe so).\n\nSpaghetti and meatballs on the late night menu.  A bit on the pricey side, but hey, you can't expect any less from a top notch Vegas hotel.  I'm a huge fan of the spaghetti and meatball, but I think this place can work on their recipe.  Call me crazy but I tasted too much fennel... but it was 3AM so who knows what I was tasting.  I also found a bit of a sausage in my pasta. (I pretended I was upset with the server in that the kitchen accidentally dropped food in my pasta that wasn't supposed to be in it.  But to be honest, I was pleasantly surprised.  It's like when you get that random onion ring in your fries at Burger King.  Best feeling EVER!!!)  But the waiter said that they add sausage to their marinara on purpose for flavoring.... Hmmmmm, should I believe him??  Our server could have been completely serious, or he could be really witty and thought of a great response right on the spot.  I will never know, but I will always remember this night and that lonely sausage.",3
review_381026,entertainment,"So I was introduced to this station about 6 months ago by a fellow yelper who goes by Amy D... She has a wicked 8-10 spot on Tuesdays and I thoroughly enjoy listening to it on a weekly basis. Well, I was happened upon an opportunity... Nay! A priviledge of being a guest on this FABULOUS show and, being the attention whore that I have been labeled, I accepted.  I won't go into HOW I found myself being handed this prestigious title of KWSS Guest, but it involved a House of Clubs, Twitter, and a whole lot of begging (on my part)...\n\nThere I was... in the presence of 100% pure, raw (Can't decide which word to use \""Talent\"" or \""Creativity\"") and in a pretty bad ass studio. The Fabulous Amy and I discussed all the important topics of the nation/world and stumbled on numerous great ideas. One being a cure for cancer! Okay, we didn't discover a cure per say... but we did briefly talk about it.\n\nThe listeners were top notch and the atmosphere was professional, yet extremely comfortable.

review_119925,entertainment,"Slots, slots, slots!\n\nIt makes me laugh that they encourage you to gamble as soon as you step foot into the airport of Sin City. Sadly, like all the casinos, the stench of cigarettes and cigars also lingers over everything here.\n\nIt kind of sucks that it's a little ways out from the Strip so you have to either shuttle or taxi in, but that's just a minor complaint. You can't really get lost, what with the bajillion signs that they have everywhere pointing the way. I've heard that security can be kind of a nightmare here, but Boyfriend and I breezed through TSA and checking in, so fingers crossed it's like this every time.",2
review_547917,entertainment,"I didn't know what to expect when we were headed to this.  I was excited and looking forward to coming here our whole trip.  I did have two Groupons that basically made this B1G1F, which was a really good deal.  \n\nWe looked at the really cool fish tank they have there and we saw it on the TLC fish tank show.  It is something you must see even if you're not going to check out the mob attraction.  It's outside of the ticket area.\n\nWe showed up and were greeted by ticket staff and they were very friendly.  We took some funny pictures and we started our journey.  This is very interactive with live actors which makes this so entertaining.  You get to see everyone from a police officer, to the head mob boss, to his henchmen. (I don't want to really give anything away)  But in the end, we were welcomed to the family. :)\n\nThere is also a measum part in the middle of the attraction.  There's this really cool computer that shows Vegas from the 20s-2007.  You can see the different hotels throughout the timeline, which ones have been around since say the 50s, which ones that have came and gone and that the Flamingo is the only one that's been around for literally forever.  There are tons of facts about the mobsters, the personal belongings and various other things.\n\nWe decided to buy two of our pictures because it was very reasonably priced.  I believe it was $23 with tax for two of them.  My bf also bought a shot glass for $5.  Not too shabby.\n\nYou can spend anywhere from an hour to three hours checking things out.  We were here for about 1 hour 45 minutes.  There are coupons being handed out all the time, you can check to see if there's a yelp deal or check out Groupon once in a while also.",3
review_597117,entertainment,"I was so excited about coming here because of all the hype.. but was so disappointed. I kept getting lost because of all the different floors. And you had to take the overcrowded stairs every time you needed to go up. The elevator was only for exiting the club. It was so hard to navigate anywhere unless you stayed in one place. The bartenders were taking forever flirting with each girl customer before moving onto the next drink order. The drinks are really expensive too, cocktails around $16-$18, and a glass of champagne $22... The only good thing about this place was the decor (which reminded me of their restaurant in San Francisco), and the amount of time we waited to get in, only about 10-15 minutes considering we arrived around 11pm-12am without any promoters walking us in or special VIP/guestlist line. Another thing, my friends booked a table for the night, and you couldn't even see the stage or the dj from the table they got.",0
review_181832,entertainment,"Not my favorite Cirque du Soleil show, but it's an okay show.\n\nThere is not a lot of a story line to the show, at least not one as memorable as some of the others I've seen.  The high dives and some of the water tricks were pretty amazing, but I found myself often getting bored in the show.  \n\nThe theater is beautiful, and the costumes and makeup are right on par, but in the end, I wasn't really impressed overall.  I find that I usually forget to breathe during their shows, but this one wasn't really as such.\n\nIt was a solid show.  Definitely a good show, but for my money?  I'd probably prefer to go elsewhere on the strip for a better Cirque show.  (Make sure you use an M Life card when purchasing your tickets.  Best deal I could find on them!)",2
review_334746,entertainment,"This small church and museum on the north side of Old Montreal is the on the site of the original church founded by Sister Marguerite Bourgeoys, one of the first settlers of Montreal, and the museum is dedicated to her life.  The church is...just a church with interesting stained glass windows, stone altar, and the regular assortment of religious art, but it does have some interesting features with replicas of sailing ships adorning the chapel (it seems the chapel is a favorite with sailors).  It's the views of Old Montreal and the Vieux-Port from the church tower make it worth the trek to this part of Old Montreal.  The small museum is located in the crypt of the church and has an adjacent associated archeological site that you can also tour.  The museum would be worth the admission to a someone interested in the history of a Canadian saint (and a woman to boot), but I can't comment on the archeological site since I didn't partake of it.\n\nThe chapel is thankfully free, but there is an $8 admission fee for the museum (it's steep considering all you get is the museum and tower access for the views).  You can add the archeological site for an extra $2, which might make it more interesting (I don't really know).  The closest metro stop is Champ De Mars, but it's still a hike up a really steep hill.\n\nI say skip it if you need time for something else, but if you have the time (or the interest) then it's worth at least an hour's visit.",2
review_111268,entertainment,"I played this course several times weekly for three years in college and never ran out of money and never got bored with the course. You can see a lot of Pete Dye in this course - railroad ties, swails that are impossible to play from, so on and so forth. A very good challenge (It plays to a 73.8/131) with a shorter, narrower front nine and a relentlessly long back nine that finishes with four of the most difficult holes you will ever play. The signature hole is #16, a 248 yard par three with a forced carry over water to the green. The hole itself snakes to the right with water right and short, and the prevailing wind fights the fade you will want to hit. In 300+ tries, I've only ever birdied this hole once.\n\nThe staff is great. Always friendly and very nice to students like myself. The price is great for students, not sure about everyone else though. I've been to the restaurant only a few times, but the food was good and I would definitely go back occasionally if I still lived there.\n\nOh, how I wish I was back in college again. Being able to play this gem every time I had a chance made work+classes+malnutrition very bearable.",4

review_190918,entertainment,"I hate to be so negative towards a show that has fairly good aspects. But I just expected so much more. Coming from a show that wasn't cheap to see. Or that has been going strong for ten years or so now. But I believe someone under the age of 12 would surely give this show four stars or more. \n\nThe acts are cool. The blue men are funny. And it was a good experience. However, the acts almost seem to repeat themselves in different ways. You just hear so much about this show you kinda go in expecting to be blown away. Don't get me wrong. It's a good show for both kids and adults. But it's mainly a family show. Rather than a couples show. \n\nBut there was one particular part, that had me in big smiles. That I won't forget. Towards the end of the show, they drop tons and tons of paper over the croud. That just keeps pouring and pouring. Almost like a snow white out. I swear I was laughing like a little kid. The audience kinda just pushes the paper towards the front till it's all gone. It's really cool. But unfortunately it wasn't enough to give it more stars. Two and a half stars if I could. Blue men, change the show up and Ill be there.",1

review_345197,entertainment,"I've finally found a place in Pittsburgh that stays open past 2am! For years now I thought that there was an unwritten rule that all nightlife had to end at 2am.\n\nZen feels like a club uprooted from NYC that just hasn't been adopted by Pittsburgh yet. It's very chic inside and I like the strict dress code which makes sure everyone inside actually look like they're supposed to be at a club, not a house party.\n\nI'm not sure what the cover is since we got bottle service. It was 2 bottles for a party of 10 in the main area, which is a pretty sweet deal especially with $80 Absolut bottles on Friday night. The music didn't get good until after midnight, which is when I think they switched DJs, and more hip-hop and R&B started playing. With their hours open until 3:30am, they probably didn't want to exhaust all their good tunes too early before the crowd came in. Also, the crowd didn't get lively until 1am, which is probably when people from the other about-to-close clubs start flowing in.\n\nThe specials there were pretty decent too. $2 wells and $1 miller lites before midnight on Friday and since the place doesn't get populated before then, ordering a drink at the bar was pretty easy.",3
review_284576,entertainment,"I guess I must be old school but when I go to a club I go to dance, not to pay a ridiculous amount of money to sit in 'VIP', get bottle service, and dance around my table with the same people I came to the club with.  So I gave this place two stars for those who want to feel special and get a table.  You can stop reading this review and go to this place if that's what you're looking for.  If you want to dance, here's the 411.  We stayed at the Mandalay Bay and were looking for a Hip Hop club.  There wasn't one there so we heard Luxor had one.  The music sounded good from the outside so I didn't mind paying $50 for me and $30 for the wife to get in.  But once we got in I realized I made a mistake.  I guess it's because I'm a Californian but I would like to think I know what a good club is and this isn't one.  The main floor is roped off to give those who pay for a table 10 extra feet of room while leaving the cheapies (like me) with no room to dance.  This left a very narrow path down the middle of the club which is meant to serve as the minuscule dance floor and walkway.  The layout could be more conducive to dancing but since this club wants to focus on bottle service don't bother coming here if you just want to dance.  And the music: what I thought was good hip hop on the outside turned out to be poorly mixed music.  The DJ kept having a lull from one song to the next leaving an awkward pause between tracks.  This caused the crowd to stand around in between songs because he couldn't mix the music correctly.  Anyways... If you want to pay extra money to make yourself feel special then come here.  If you are trying to bump and grind find another spot and save yourself the money.",1

review_79358,entertainment,"I absolutely love free stuff, and when it's not free then super cheap will do. Cinemark fits the bill with it's dirt cheap movies. I mean .75 for a movie on a Monday? Wow, that's just unheard of, and the theater is pretty nice for being a discount theater. I go here as often as possible because you absolutely cannot beat the price. \n\nI've never stepped onto a sticky floor yet in this place and every chair I've plopped myself in was just as comfy as the last. The funniest thing to me, and I'm probably testing some of your ages here is that the doors to the theater always make me feel like I'm walking into Pee Wee's play house. I love it!! I'm waiting for him to spring out one day and tell me the word of the day so I can scream whenever I hear it. \n\nBut, then I'm reeled back to reality when the previews start and they tell me to be quiet and turn off my cell phone. No secret word of the day here... but as far as movies go, this is an awesome place. I don't typically eat the food at most theaters but be forewarned, if you do, it'll cost ya. It's about the same as getting it at a normal theater, but even so, you can't beat the fact that usually about 4 people can go see a movie here  for the price of one ticket at a first run theater. \n\nGreat choice for a date night, or just because.

review_313136,entertainment,"This is a review for the Big Shot ride.\n\nThe ride on a beautiful warm clear October night? Amazing. The view of Vegas and the feeling of weightlessness made this a great experience for me. I could have gone on the ride several times; alas, I just had one ticket, and a fairly pricey one at that ($18). Yes, it is scary, but in a pleasant way.\n\nThe observation deck is also worth a visit. Had we not been heading out for other activities, I would have loved staying a while. \n\nThe building had a bit of a rundown feel. The process of getting to the top of the tower was unnecessarily complicated. Get on that elevator, then go up; get off; get on another one; no, not this one; no not that one either. Oh, those people aren't going on the ride? They have to get off here. Etc. etc. etc. It took about 10 minutes to get up to the right floor and probably 15 to get back down!\n\nThey don't need an MBA to come in and analyze their organization. Just grab anyone coming down and ask about the elevator situation and figure out a way to get people up and down efficiently. It's not that hard. \n\nGreat ride, though.",3
review_532471,entertainment,"To begin this review fairly I was must mention that I am a late 80's baby so most of the music that I recall is from the 90's.  I know Gladys Knight, Diana Ross, The Temptations and some of the other groups that were \""impersonated\"" and the main singing lady, Jin Jin Reaves, has one hell of a voice and definitely a lot of talent. \n\nI left feeling some kind of way for a couple reasons:\n\n(1) I felt underwhelmed by the show after the first girl (Jin Jin) and the first group guy performance because it dawned on me that they were just going to run in the back, change outfits and pretend to be someone else - for tickets that are $60-80 a piece, I would expect more - ESPECIALLY in Vegas. \n\n(2) The vocals were mediocre once you kind of got the hang of what was going on - very glee-ish or halloween night at the karaoke bar is more like it.  Not saying those folks aren't talented, but the show needed more \""oomph\"" - they were constantly having to go thru and try to hype up the crowd where as in a good show the crowd is hyped - think Michael Jackson - when he would turn his head - people would fall out and have to be carried out on a stretcher - this was before the concert even started he just turned his head.  If you're going to have a show in Vegas I'm ready to be amazed - I view Vegas as the ultimate performing arts center.  Just my opinion.",1

review_425400,entertainment,"Food was pretty good, but I'll NEVER go again for dinner. I went to Culinary Dropout on a Saturday night -- there was a live band, but they were WAY too loud, and pretty terrible. We had to shout at our waitress, and still she had trouble hearing us and vice versa. I literally couldn't have a conversation with the person sitting across the table from me.\n\nThe \""vibe\"" was interesting. Half the fun was looking at all of the obscurely dressed \""alternative\"" crowd that was eating there. Many of the patrons seemed to give off the \""my world is a dark abyss and my parents just don't understand me\"" aura. Unfortunately, I could not share my quippy observations with anyone else at my table, given the noise. The decor was pretty abhorrent, and the restaurant was uncomfortably cold (it was nighttime in early February), given that they left all the doors and windows open.\n\nI had the trout, which was very tasty. Additionally, the pretzel bites with fondue appetizer was VERY good. At the end of the day though, I'd rather eat at Wendy's were I can actually converse, than some hipster joint where I can't hear anything other than a jazz musician (who didn't seem to fit the scene... he was the only non-white I could spot in the crowd) eating the microphone and playing the harmonica (poorly) at 10,000 deciles.",1
review_475093,entertainment,The coolest thing about this arena is suit 66 and that is Only a dream unless you happen to be a millionaire that doesn't mind spending a thousand dollars for 1 game. It's basically a combination of Wells Fargo Center (but smaller) and Verizon Center (but newer). It's design is basically ripped off from every other arena built in the last 15 years. Not to mention fans walk in front of you from the time the game starts till the end.\n\nI prefer The old civic center. At least that arena had character.,0

There were many 40+ something men going after early to mid 20s girls/women. That resonated throughout the place. I actually walked around the entire venue to see if I \""felt\"" differently, but nope it was all over. \n\nNot only that but people were indifferent about dancing in groups with strangers. I was there with my wife and she doesn't really dance so I tried to casually get into a group of 3 or 4 and there was no welcoming.

Flashforward to looking for wedding venues, when I heard we were going to check it out I was almost already sold on it.  \n\nOur event turned out better than I thought is was going to visually. It was the exact atmosphere we were looking for, we didn't want a cheesy banquet hall with floral carpets or a golf course like most people do and we didn't have a lot of money to spend on other places.  This place was right in our budget and was easily one of the highlights of my wedding. Riette runs the place and she couldn't have been more enjoyable to work with, she was easy going and didn't really put a lot of restirctions on us for what we could or couldn't do.\n\nOverall, with some family members in the wedding industry, it's hard to find things that are new to them and have that wow factor.

I bribed the dbag behind the chord to just let us in right away, cover is 30$ on that weekend, an average weekend, and the decor is ok, nothing that was really amazing, dance floor was actually pretty small, pretty much a little smaller than haze's dance floor.

review_595097,entertainment,"My friends and I always choose Hard Rock as the hotel to stay at every time we go to Vegas.  Our prior experiences were great and fabulous until the last visit last May of this year.   I was so livid when I checked out of this hotel. First of all, we stay at HR because we like the fact that we can go to Sunday Rehab without any problems and get in for free. As we checked in the hotel, we were told that the policy changed and we need book our room for Sunday night to get the same privileged we had before.  The front desk was trying to charge us the regular rate and said the Rehab entrance fee was about $100-$250 per person.  We opted for another room and managed to get in ourselves for free at the door.  We felt like they were trying really hard to get us to stay one more night and pay a higher room rate.  \n\nI was so livid when I checked out of the hotel.  One thing for sure is that I will not stay at Hard Rock going forward.  I feel that they use the pool party to act \""big and mighty\"" and lost their great customer service they once had.  \n\nNext trip will definitely be at Encore and my Sunday Rehab days is over.

But since, I got dragged from my gfs to get in, I did. The pool was so icky and warm that i felt gross in it.

review_179660,entertainment,"So a couple of friends and I decided to hit up Vegas the weekend before Thanksgiving and, seeing as I'd never been to Tao, we decided that it might be fun to check out the club everybody seems to be talking about!\n\nHeaded over on a Friday night--I suggest you put your name on the guestlist and get there before midnight. It helps, I swear. It also helps to surround yourself with a large number of girls if you're a guy, so thank God we had that cleared. \n\nFirst things first: the girls in the bathtubs? They look as if they hate their very existence and spend more time covering their boobies than sloshing about all sexy-like in the water.\n\nThe drinks? Please. Laughable at best, extremely expensive (12 dollars for a shot?!), and small!\n\nThe music is your basic hip-hop-Top 40 mix, which tells me the club has yet to go super mainstream. There's more to music than Tupac's \""California Love\"" or Kanye's rehash.  Tao would be a much cooler place if they mixed it up and threw in some electro.\n\nI will say, however, that the decor is something out of a movie. Over the top, ridiculously artificial, and a bit too overblown for my taste. The huge Buddha staring at you over the dancefloor makes you feel like praying, not dancing.\n\nIf you don't have a table (and they have millions! In places you wouldn't expect!) don't think you'll sit down ANYWHERE. Security's tight, so if you're tired or your feet hurt, suck it up.",1
review_41948,entertainment,"LOCATION: Conveniently located right off of Scottsdale Rd, not TOO far south of the 101, in central Scottsdale. It is actually part of a park with a kids' playground. Easy free parking.\n\nSTUFF TO DO:\nFor the \""adults\""-There is a train car that has been restored as a small museum with some artifacts, displays, photos, etc.  Additionally, there is a large building that houses a massive miniature train set that has villages, forests, mountains, etc. It is amazing and I couldn't stop looking! The detail is incredible and it will bring out the kid in you! The kids will be amazed as well! \nFor the \""kids\""- There is a carousel and a kiddie train to ride. There is also a large playground.\n\nVALUE: It is cheap to enter the little museum (under $5 I think?). It is free to enter the building to see the miniature train sets (but donations keep this place going so don't be stingy).\n\nAGE RANGE: Geared towards families or kids, but someone who is into trains/history/really awesome miniature villages would enjoy it as well!\n\nCHRISTMAS LIGHTS TRAIN RIDE: For a few dollars, you can ride a miniature train into a winter wonderland. Borrow someone's kid if you need to; it is pretty fun if you are a kid at heart and like Christmas lights. Might be a fun light hearted date too! Tip- the line gets INSANELY long. Line up at 5:30 to wait in line for the 6:00 ride. If you don't, there is a chance you will be waiting for WELL over an hour.\n\nSOUVENIRS/FOOD: The gift shop needs some more...gifts!! The snacks pretty much consist of ice cream and hot dogs in foil. I think a small cafe would do well in this location.\n\nFINAL VERDICT: If I had kids of my own (and if I lived in Arizona), this would definitely be a place to which I would return...and I would definitely make the Christmas lights night train ride an annual tradition.",3
review_280483,entertainment,"After my visit to Eide's Entertainment, I must say I am not a fan and was in no way impressed. A fact that was even more disappointing, considering it was the only store out of about five or so that I wanted to visit during my weekend in Pittsburgh that I actually got to shop at. Seeing how much other people love it, I feel that my unhappiness with Eide's probably needs some further explanation. \n\nFirst of all, this place is much more of a comic book store than it is a record store, something I was completely aware of going into it. However, I was still disappointed with the selection of records that the store offered. It didn't seem very diverse to me and much of it seemed extremely over priced. I ended up only buying one record from Eide's because of this. In addition, and the biggest reason I am giving Eide's two stars, is the staff here is very, very rude. No, I don't mean your typical \""I work at a record store so I am better than you\"" rude you get at some stores. The employees working on the record level of the store were just plain nasty. I saw a 40+ year old man yell at my little sister for putting a record back out of alphabetical order. Keep in mind, my little sister is about 5 feet tall and maybe weigh 100 lbs. I guess that this guy gets his jollies off of bullying little girls, who knows, but it was unacceptable. To top it off, he did everything but accuse my sister of stealing the record, because he couldn't find it. Of course he couldn't find it because my sister did put it back in alphabetical order where it went. Ass.\n\nLong story short, I will never ever return to Eide's Entertainment and I would discourage anyone else who cares about being treated with some sense of decency to do the same. These guys really need to get over themselves.",1

My boyfriend and I only decided to show up here because we were staying at Excalibur and were given a \""free admission for two before 12 am.\"" coupon. We showed up at 12, but had to wait in a line and didn't get in until 12:15. Okay, so I was hoping they would honor the coupon anyway, but figured they would at least give us some kind of discounted rate. Well, the woman working the \""cash box\"" or whatever it is just looked at us and said, \""no, i'm not taking those anymore and it's $90 for the both of you. $60 for him, $30 for you.\""\n\nWHAT?!!!!!\n\nI have been to and partied in Vegas a myriad of times and never, NEVER has some club, especially of the likes of LAfreakingX had the audacity to charge such outrageous prices for entrance. I stopped my boyfriend from handing over his credit card, asked her to repeat herself, responded with, \""hell to the no,\"" performed an About Face and started to make our way out. One of the bouncer/security guard dudes caught my reaction and our attempt to leave and stopped us trying to figure out why we were so disgusted. In hopes to keep our business, he offered to slash the cost in half. Just like that. In a snap, from $90 to $45. In retrospect, any place that obviously inflates their admission like that shouldn't have received any of our business, but since we were there already, we decided to take the offer.\n\nMistake. \n\nUnderwhelmed. The dance floor is small and ridiculously cramped. The club does offer some space, but the majority of it was roped off for \""VIP\"" or \""Bottle Service\"" that no one seemed to take advantage of. Probably because this place sucks major bolas. So you have a super cramped dance floor, and empty space you can't even use. Drink prices were ridiculous. $28 for two drinks. What kind of crack are they smoking? I may have been able to overlook all of this if the one key factor in a great club existed: Great Music. Negative on this as well. The music here was hours of the same Auto-Tuned hip hop crap that sounds like one constant stream of yuckiness. There were the occasional Biggie or Jay-Z hits sprinkled in. Enough for me to shake it for a minute or two, but then back to the same old crap. It's funny how much more your feet hurt in heels when you're busy not having a good time or not enjoying the music.\n\nWe will never ever return to this place. And I urge you Yelpers to stay away.

review_238501,entertainment,"I went to the Gallery for the first time this June and saw the American Modernism exhibit, which is made up of loans from the fantastic Museum of Fine Arts (MFA), Boston. It took about 45-60 minutes to get through the whole exhibition. The extra 15 minutes was if you were to stay and watch the Georgia O'Keefe documentary in another room. This also assumes you look at each painting and listen to the commentaries on each one that has one.\n\nI have to say the woman they chose to read some of the audio commentaries on the audio unit should be replaced. She BUTCHERED some of the artist names and concepts. Did anyone instruct her how to pronounce these words correctly  before recording or proof-listen to the final product? They could have got a art history student at UNLV who would have done a better job.\n\nThe entrance fee is a bit high at $15 for adults, but if that actually helps cover the cost of the exhibition, I suppose its okay. The museum wasn't that busy for a Sunday late afternoon though. Wynn should buy one of the original Dog's Playing Poker pictures and put it in the Bellagio to poke fun at all the people ignoring the fine art to gamble mind numbingly.\n\nNow that the Guggenheim LV shut down, this the only fine art gallery on the Strip. Don't forget the LV Museum of Art on West Sahara though. And no, the Liberace Museum does not count no matter how many sequins and sparkly things are on the walls.\n\nVerdict: When you have $15 bucks left of your allotted $500, go enrich yourself at the art gallery instead of enriching the casino.",3

From signs all down 60 assuring you that you're going the right way, to having a specific Ren Faire lane to a plethora of parking attendants, everything was organized perfectly.\n\nBefore I talk about the Faire itself, I have to say I was incredibly impressed at how disability accessible this place was. Between tons and tons of handicap park, ramps into each store, first aid people walking around with red cross flags so you knew where the first aid was, and even handicap reserved seating at the joust.

Their use of lighting and special effects does create an alluring feel to the stage that pulls you just a bit more.  Of course, one would have to be a bit open-minded to appreciate a show like this.  It's definitely a tease though and has you wanting more by the time you leave.\n\nI should mention the two side acts that were mixed into the show were the weirdest things ever.  Weird in the sense that I didn't know how they fit into the whole thing, and crazy becomes some of it was just damn crazy!  \n\nThey have two shows nightly (8:00pm and 10:30pm), except for Tuesdays.  They request business casual attire and 18 and over only.  Tickets are $59/pp.",3

review_236450,entertainment,"I was honestly shocked at just how much I wound up enjoying my stay at Caesars Palace.  Though we had initially booked a room in the Forum Tower, which I had heard was a lengthy suitcase drag from the front desk, we wound up being upgraded to the newly renovated Augustus Tower due to our room not being prepared upon our arrival.  Our new space provided a luxurious experience that included dual flat-screen TVs (one in the bathroom), a jacuzzi tub, floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the Strip and the Bellagio fountain show, a large sitting area, and more.  The room was extremely clean and well-kept.  Plus, the beds were very comfortable.\n\nWhile the hotel was large and involved a substantial effort to navigate, I found it much more inviting and less overwhelming than the MGM Grand, where I had stayed a few years back.  The Forum Shops provided access to high-class shopping, decadent restaurants, and enjoyable entertainment.  The pool area was ridiculously amazing!  When we first stepped out onto the patio, we were amazed by the large pool that loomed in front of us.  On the first afternoon, we parked ourselves adjacent to this crowded venue.  However, before heading back inside later that day, I did some exploring and discovered that there were several other pools laying just behind the main attraction, including one with swim-up blackjack tables.  So, we made sure to enjoy those additional sections on the following day.  The staff at the pool was extremely welcoming, and the cocktail list was spectacular.  My Cranberry Mojito included a bunch of ripe berries and fresh mint sprigs.  It was incredibly refreshing and addicting!  There was also a pool party occurring in a blocked off section of the yard that we could not see, but could definitely hear.  We decided not to participate, but it seemed like the party-goers were enjoying themselves.\n\nAll in all, Caesars Palace provided all of the standard amenities and more, without being as hectic and stressful as the other large casinos on the Strip.  This old classic had been revamped and ready to take on even the trendiest of hotels.",3
review_621028,entertainment,"I've been to some pretty outstanding aquariums and this one doesn't compare.  \n\nTo be fair, it has a lot of disadvantages based on it's location. It's in mall. It's no where near the ocean. This totally takes away the ocean atmosphere. It's hard to compare it to Waikiki Aquarium, Monterey Aquarium or Atlanta Aquarium.  \n\nThat being said, it's okay for what it is. The kids enjoyed the colorful and well put together exhibits.  The playground at the end helped them burn off that energy. \n\nThe fact that you can reenter all day is a plus. I'm just sad that it wasn't bigger and my kids were expecting a sea turtle.",1

To see Andy's work collected in one place and arranged in a chronology is to really appreciate what he achieved.  The building itself is a perfect showcase.  I love the cloud room that recreates the famous \""factory\"" and the room full of his Mao's. The best room is the one that shows his early career as a shoe illustrator for department store advertisements.  I wish they would issue some good Mao posters.",4
review_315886,entertainment,"A quick side trip while in Vegas. Nothing special - the chocolate factory tour is self guided, lackluster, and not really informative. I think everyone is in it for the free sample at the end. The cactus garden is cool but takes 2-3 minutes to walk through. \n\nIf you're in the area make a stop here. If not, it's not worth going out of your way for. You get what you pay for, in other words: it's free for a reason.",2
review_346265,entertainment,"In town on business and decided to get a workout in. I brought my own equipment, so I can't comment on quality of rentals, although they had a well stocked shop, so I'm assuming their equipment is adequate. If you're renting,  the performance difference between a downturned bouldering shoe, or a nice comfy flat shoe probably wouldn't matter anyways. The gentleman at the front desk seemed friendly enough, I didn't take a class since I was just there to boulder all by my lonesome, so yet again, I have nothing to say on the safety aspect or quality of beginner instruction. \n\nThe bouldering cave was sweeeeeeet! I've never seen anything like it in all the gyms I've been in. You can basically do a 50 ft overhanging climb without roping up. If you fall, you just slip on down a cushioned slide. Of course you can't exactly start over where you fell, so just don't fall... Can't say that I consistently followed that mantra. There was also a ton of other bouldering routes upstairs and down. It seemed that the mix is 65\\35 bouldering to top rope/lead routes. Although I could be wrong since I didn't get on any ropes.\n\nThe main concern here, I'm probably going to echo other reviews. The floor leaves much to be desired. There were several spots with holes in it, so you have to be careful where you step. I didn't see or feel any holes near the walls, so you will be safe falling, but walking around might be a different story. The carpet seams are also upturned and will trip you if you don't pay attention. Of course I don't go to a gym to hangout on the floor, so onto the routes.\n\nI was fairly impressed with the thoughtfulness of the routes. There were definitely some tricky moves that required some thinking. The varied nature of them was also a nice touch. There were even a few that said no feet, so campus right to the top, cool. The grading wasn't the most consistent, but it's better than other places I have been to. Another gripe though, it was very dim in there, some of the routes were hard to find because the tape was hiding in the darkness. I'm sure that I could have got a few lights turned on, but since I was the only one in there for the first hour, no need to cater the whole gym to just me. The training area was also pretty good. Campus board, system wall, power balls even a bachar ladder. No hangboards that I saw up there though.\n\nOverall I was impressed with the number of routes and that sweet sweet boulder cave/slide. The flooring needs some major work though and I'm giving 3 stars because I should only be falling on routes, and not on floor creases.",2

review_531003,entertainment,"Gates of hell is pure terror. It tests your fears, and really makes you think. My girlfriend and I went in castle vampire then gates of hell. We didn't do circus of horror because she HATES clowns. \nAnyways. We went in castle vampire first and I thought it was gonna be stupid. And it was not. It was amazing props and illusions. This house was one of the best vampire ones ever. Very well set up. AMAZING. I fell at the end because you'll see why ;)\n\nThen gates of hell came up.......  Very vulgar and provocative. My kind of scare! :) starts off with you getting pushed into a \""box\"" by yourself and listening to the devil in your ear. Then we went through it all. It was WAAYYYY scarier then last year. Longer especially. So we were walking, things popping out, getting thrown around, and SHOCKED. Yes. They had it last year and it's my fear. I almost started crying because you have to go through this scene to make it through and you get shocked more than 10 times. It hurts. Anyways it took us a while because I didn't know if I was gonna make it.  We did. Then came this vulgar. Utter rotten smell. Smelt like dead bodies. And we were in a bathroom and this girl or guy popped out and grabbed my girlfriend and out her against a wall. And pinned her on the floor. He had her there for a good 5 minutes and she was BALLING CRYING. She said the safe word \""purgatory\"" but softly so they didn't let her go because I don't think they could hear her. I got her up and he or she grabbed her again and she was crying horribly I tried to help her 6 times but the person was way to strong. We finally got her up and went through. She said it felt like she was gonna get raped. But hey she knew what she was gonna get into. Then we encountered the \""master\"" and it was amazing. Then it ended. A good 20 minute or so house. Nothing like it anywhere. I recommend. If you like getting grabbed, \""raped\"", shocked and cussed at. They call you every word in the book especially cunt. EVERYONE GO.",4

As a Pittsburgh native remembering it's first opening when it was just bboys, graff heads, MC's and DJ's doing their local thing, it's amazing to see this place has become so professional, original, and really stands-out and is positively active for the community and continuing growth of Pittsburgh.  The service is delightful on both sides (AVA/Shadow Lounge), the prices are just right, the sound system is a complete BANGER with crisp and clean sound.

The local discount was only valid for the mid level seats... not close but far from the worst. \nthe audience went wild when Penn and Teller came out on stage..that's when stuff went downhill... all of the \""setups\"" took six times longer than the actual illusion.  the absence of any monitors made it impossible to see what was going on. you can not see a bullet from 100 yards!!! or see the face of card!!!! too little content and too much talk!!! my review may have been different if I could have seen what was going on. The man next to me was trying to give his girlfriend the details of what was happening on stage (she could not see anything going on) and became frustrated and left early. \n\nI wanted to like the show!!!

review_128159,entertainment,"So we got to come here for their VIP night last week and being I had never been here before it was a nice surprise. We weren't sure what to expect but you started out in the club room with johnny depp and george clooney, a good start! They served appetizers and drinks, had a DJ and plenty of places to sit.  There was a picture opportunity as well but as with one or two others I wasn't sure with who the figure was supposed to be.  (hence the 4 instead of 5 stars).  As you continue room to room there is a different theme, different appetizers were served based on the theme and drinks to match.  there were about 4 different places to get a professional photo op and we had fun posing as some had props.  Each guest got a picture to take home as well which is a nice momento.  We each also got a Madame Tussauds small bottle of sparkling wine to take with us.  \nThere were plenty of fun moments throughout the night but the 4D superhero movie was probably our favorite part.  Its only 10 minutes but it was quite fun and entertaining.  Thanks to yelp for this opportunity and a night filled with memories that continue to make us laugh.",3

My 2-star rating has nothing to do with the quality of the show, which was excellent, but rather my disappointment in how the show was run.\n\nNever in my life have I ever paid $100 for seats to watch a performance where LATE arrivals were accommodated by ushers and allowed to find their seats once the show had already begun -- DURING the first, second, and third acts of the show.\n\nI understand that people arrive late, but in my experience, those people are always allowed to be seated during the breaks -- NOT WHILE THE PERFORMERS ARE ON STAGE AND YOU ARE BLOCKING MY $100 VIEW!!  Ugh, there were several people in the seats behind me yelling at people to sit down.  I couldn't believe how rude and inconsiderate the ushers were to allow this to happen.\n\nNever been so disappointed by Cirque before.  Ridiculous.",1

review_478649,entertainment,"We heard a lot of hype about this place being that it was all over the news and radio for being the scariest haunted house in the US. However, I was slightly disappointed for two reasons, one of them being out this place's control. \n1.) There was still a slight wait so just as our group made it to the front and would be the next batch in, we were kicked out because of a \""threat\"". Police surrounded, which made us go back out to try to get our money back. However, we were told it was a bomb threat from a suspicious package being found in a pitch black portion of the haunted maze. Apparently a little kid got lost inside as well, so they had to go find him.  And they wouldn't let us get our money back, so our options were to wait until it was ok to go back in, or leave and forfeit the $25. So we waited, took about 90 minutes (no bomb, found the kid I guess). By then, unfortunately, the fear and adrenaline has subsided, especially when the \""actors\"" also had to evacuate and you could see it really wasn't that scary. \n2.) After waiting to go in, we got to go inside slightly after midnight, but with all the rush of everyone wanting to go in and the actors being tired, we all got rushed through and finished in about 20 minutes versus the 45min we were told it would take. Also ,there was no Jacob Kell theme, or maybe I misunderstood from reading the legend on the website that we weren't going to an actual haunted house, but a warehouse decked out in scary type stuff. There were clowns, and if the theme was to mock a serial killer, I don't really know where clowns fit in. \n\nHere are some things I enjoyed: the 3D portion where you walk along a tunnel that is spinning and a wobbly bridge. That was really cool. Again, more clowns so that was really weird. I hate clowns. The pitch black maze was pretty awesome. You run into the walls quite a bit, which adds to the fun because you have to feel your way around. Not to mention there might be some surprises around certain corners. \n\nIf this place was actually at Jacob Kell's house where he murdered all those people, at disturbing and scary that would be to be on the premises, I would say it's worth the $25. Otherwise, you should go on a thursday next time when it's back when you get a large student discount, or can go in a group of 4 to save more on admission. Heard a lot of people calling in to file complaints. Maybe we'll get our money back. The whole old saloon wild west theme that you walk into before getting to the nest also killed the mood for me. I guess to me, that made me realize it's not really a haunted house, but a staged one.  Oh yeah, the $5 parking fee sucked too. Didn't know we'd have to pay for that\n\nI'd probably have more fun if it wasn't so expensive and there wasn't a fake bomb threat. That's what we get for going on halloween I guess",2
review_104360,entertainment,"This is one of those places I've driven by a thousand times, yet have never been to. We went here after dinner and my date told me that they have a nice patio for drinks. From the road, it looks like any establishment, but as soon as you get to the entrance, it's like you're walking on the set of Pirates of the Carribean! It was really cool. The outside patio was designed to look like a beach front dock with a lagoon. There are two fireplaces on the lower patio with a bar in the middle. And then seating on a deck on the outside of the bar. Inside there is a bar and also high backed booths to fit two or four people. The ambiance of this place is unlike any place I've been to before. (note...I'm new to the valley!). The service was fast and courteous and the drinks strong! There's room for large groups outside and it's a very festive crowd. I'm going back there this Saturday for drinks with friends and encourage you to go too. \n\nI haven't eaten there yet, so I can only give the place four stars, but I loved this place. If I had friends visiting from out of town, this is the kind of place I'd take them too.",3

The design of the inside of the bar is nice, but why sit inside when you can hang outside facing the spectacular view of the Las Vegas strip.

We were on a guest list and were let through, only to be sent back up the stairs because they didn't give us the piece of paper saying entry was comped. We went back up, got our piece of paper and then entered the club. TALK ABOUT SMALL!!! This club is tiny compared to others I have been to in Vegas. The place was packed with people and there was no where to sit besides getting bottle service. I understand the club's need to make money but having somewhere to sit after being on the overcrowded dance floor would  be nice. There are so many better places to go in Vegas.

We loved that the Paris is centrally located across from Bellagio and Caesars & the Forum shops, and a short walk to MGM and New York.  Our check in was easy and quick..5-10 minutes max!  Staff were friendly and professional.   The rooms were clean, quiet, and the bathrooms were large and very nice!   The coffee shop opens early and was a great place for morning coffee.  The casino was nice and a friend won money each night, including $2,000 on the last night.\nThe Bad, the views for the cheaper rooms are as you would expect, of the roof!   The lower floors had even worse views.    The restaurants are popular and without reservations far in advance we were unable to get in to either the Steak house or Mon Ami Gabi   I didn't anticipate having such a long wait to catch taxis to get to the airport, and was late getting to the airport!  (Get in line earlier than you expect).  \nThe ugly, the rooms aren't bad,  but run down.  We didn't find stains on the bed or furniture, but we did encounter stains on the floor under the ottoman, very similar to the pictures posted below. Looks like when they cleaned the carpets the furniture bled onto the carpet, could have been rust.   But it was minor over all.

review_384025,entertainment,"OK so I went here late at night at about 12 am on a Friday night right after checking out the Interview over at the theater across the st.\n\nThe security of this place is absolutely crazy, which makes sense given that when we went all the college kids were off from school, meaning party time.... which is basically what we walked into after showing our IDs to the bouncer. By this time the restaurant area was blocked off and it was just the main bar - beer hall area. They had a cover band playing what you would expect a band to play at a frat party all while wearing leaderhosen.  Most of the patrons were standing on benches and dancing around. Which in a way was kind of unexpected as I would think they stand when singing drinking songs not, Neil Diamon or AC/DC. \n\nAnyway, we walked on to the bar and waited a few to put in our beer order. While waiting one of the patrons tried to cut in front of us, but fortunately the bartender noted this and totally blew the guy off for a bit. Also prior to making our drink order, the bartender asked once again for our ID. Given the high number of college/possibly HS kids I totally got it... and also felt bad for the wait staff as a lot of the patrons seemed just so douchey.  We got our beer right away which was delicious... what you would expect from Hofbrauhaus. Now as we were enjoying our beer we enjoyed the people watching, which was quite entertaining.  \n\nAfter our one beer, we left, as it definitely is not a place for conversation. More of a place to get trashed. Now, I really don't know if this is the normal scene, but I was not that impressed. I will also say we didn't try any of their food, which is something we plan to do when it gets warmer as they have really nice outdoor seating overlooking the river.",2

review_179536,entertainment,"Everything started out smoothly for a Memorial Long Weekend night at Tao's especialy since we got in only after 5 minutes of waiting in line. Perhaps this is because we were on the guest list, though. \n\nOnce you step inside, there are many courteous doormen which assist you and guide you to the club. You feel very privileged because of them..hah\n\n\nI was really impressed by how beautiful all the people were here. I'd say for every 10 people you saw, only 1 would be off, and even then they would be at least half decent.\n\nAnyway, besides the crowd, decor is beautiful. There are also two bars. The middle level of Tao's is the Tao's Night Club, the upper level is Tao Beach, and the bottom level is the Tao Bistro. For Tao's Night Club, I'd have to say there are some cool hidden corners. There are also bath tubs with nude women taking in bath in rose petals which was kind of cool. Lighting is very dim. \n\nI'd say this is a fun place to check out but it gets old after a while. Especially if you go on a crowded night, you get the feeling that it gets clausterphobic!

A little too crowded for my taste..\n\nTips:\n* I believe you can get complimentary admission if you are a girl by grabbing a pass at the Tao Bistro (get it during the day time before you go!)\n* get there early if you want to avoid the lines. We got to the club by 10 and that probably helped us get in faster; We left the club at 1am and the lines were ridiculously long still...\n* Don't wear jeans... the people really do look at you up and down\n*There's free valet!

We got there 15min before our reservation so we had time to take a look at all the cars which was fun. This is a great unique gift for someone. \n\nThe worst part about this was the timing. They cram a lot of people into each session. Even though we were one of the first checked in, somehow we got screwed and ended up at the back of the line for everything. The last called for the ride along, the last called for the actually ride, and the last for the corvette ride along. We waited at least 40 minutes to be called for our car. That was ridiculous and really killed our mood. Then we waited almost an hour for the ride along. Overall we were here for 3.5 hours for only a 7 lap ride and a 2 min ride along in the corvette. That really felt like such a waste of half the day. I realize they only have so many cars and drivers but if they can't handle the amount in each session, book less people. It really took a lot of our energy away when we sat around for an hour and a half doing nothing. By the time we were finally done we had zero interest in waiting around for the video and just left.

My drink was pretty strong, which certainly alleviated my losing streak at video poker. The food took at least 20-30 minutes to come out even though the bar was pretty much empty. I liked how they put your food on a cutting board if you're sitting at the bar. The portions weren't as big as I thought they would be given the prices they charged. Our server/bartender pretty much ignored us after Mike got his food so we hightailed it to Harrah's sports bar to watch the game.",1
review_201735,entertainment,"Movies not in the main Harkins Theatres are shown here. Most are great & meaningful. As of today, I have seen every movie playing at Camelview until Friday:\n500 Days of Summer\nThe Cove\nFood Inc.\nThe Hurt Locker\nPaper Heart\nAll these movies left me feeling great because I know the time I spent watching the movie was worthwhile. I have learned a lot with each movie and have decided to become a vegetarian as a result of seeing Food Inc. and The Cove.\nYou can't beat the free Medium popcorn ($4) everytime you go to Harkins as long as you wear or bring your $24.25 Harkins T-Shirt in the wrapping as well as the $1 refill on a large souvenir cup. This really differentiates Harkins from AMC for the loyal moviegoer. I only go to AMC when it is unavoidable.",4

review_223418,entertainment,"Pretty great music venue - been here a ton of times.\n\nThey have two levels which is nice for those who want to be in on the action and then those who want a more laid back approach.\n\nThere are two HUGE bars on the lower level - so you are always close to a new drink.\nStaff is pretty nice, I've never had to wait long at all. and the drinks are cheap!\n\nDownstairs area is pretty large and fits a ton of people which is great.  The only thing is the big sound/lighting box basically in the middle of the floor - can kind of get in the way, but doesn't bother me too much as I'm usually pushing my way to the front and in front of it.\n\nSound is pretty great - never had any complaints like at other venues I've been to where you really cant make out anything.\n\nBathrooms are meh...but honestly I've seen WAY worse at a venue.\n\nOverall - a Charlotte staple in the music scene.",3
review_201069,entertainment,I called to check for locals deal and was told I had to go to some zoo something or other.com site to buy locals tickets. This site did not have the MJ Immortal tickets so I went back to Mandalay site and bought my tickets through them (which brings you to ticketmaster). I got a mailer that stated local specials and had the MJ show which had no expiration date. I went to the ticket counter the night of the show and showed them my tickets and the mailer and explained what the lady on the phone said (that the site she sent me to did not have the MJ show but here is this mailer) the sales counter person told me the locals special ended on the 23 (I'm standing there on the 26) and that because I bought my tickets from ticketmaster (where Mandalay site sends you) and didn't call to buy (which I just explained thoroughly I DID) they would not do anything for me. I'm sorry but that is just very poor customer service if you send out a mailer you should honor it and your customer service phone people should know when your locals deals are available!!!!! Poor job Mandalay!!!!,0

review_467215,entertainment,"Talk about an absolutely awesome time! I used the Living Social coupon ($25 = 1/2 off) and went with my visiting family on a tour and we were all blown away by the fantastic time we had! Get over looking nerdy ...it's WORTH IT! I highly recommend this for visiting family and friends- I literally couldn't stop laughing and smiling, we all agreed this was our favorite activity of the week. The tour will take you all through the little nooks and crannies in Charlotte and shows off some fabulous art and history. It is very easy to maneuver however I myself would not bring my own grandmother but agility varies from person-to-person. Our tour kid was a younger guy ( Tremane?)  he was patient, knowledgeable and overall an awesome guide! \n\nBe forewarned they are only doing weekend tours right now - so plan ahead. My only complaint is the woman I made reservations with was SUPER rude...she became very snotty with me when I tried to inquire about reservations over the phone and actually yelled at me saying she did not have her calendar in front of her (why not? I called your business not your cell?) do not make my mistake and call, just email. She frustrated me so much I almost cancelled...but luckily once we got there the staff was wonderful.",4

Lastly, there is a dog park attached at the southern end for those who are looking for a place to take their pets. Be aware that they are building a police station at the southwest end of the park.

review_462551,entertainment,"At 9 dollars per person, Clark County's outdoor shooting park is good place if you want to \""unload\"" some stress and shoot some targets. The facility is very well maintained and offers areas for rifle, pistol, shotgun/skeet, as well as archery. The price for the rifle/pistol range is more than reasonable and the store offers firearm rentals, targets, eye/ear protection, ammo, and most everything you may need for your shooting hearts desire. The rifle range offers up to 100 yard distances for precision shooters. Tables and stands are provided and bays are very clean. Place is great for zeroing a new rifle and practicing your marksmanship. \n\nThat being said, the place has more rules than most other shooting ranges. New timers must first obtain their yellow pass to shoot by first watching the instructional and introductory video to ccsp. Rso's are always observant about range safety and are quick to enforce range rules. However they also offer tips and tricks to new shooters and are available should you have any questions with your firearm. \n\nPlace does get busy during the weekend or at peak hours. Also as a tip, you should know and be very familiar with how to clear and safety check your weapon before coming here.",3

We had a fantastic, relaxing time. \n\nOne of the things that I loved, too, was their consciousness that they are not ON the strip.

review_62511,entertainment,"The Wedding Room is a fantastic place to hold a reception, as we did just a couple days ago!\n\nPatty is amazing to work with.  I simply cannot praise her highly enough!  She is professional and helpful.  The first time we checked out this reception hall I thought it looked kind of cheesy, but I walked away from it thinking that Patty feels like a favorite aunt, and wishing that she worked at a higher-end place so we would feel more comfortable booking it.  When we got home and looked at our finances, the budget actually made this place look better and better.  The deals they have are amazing!  for $3000, we got the hall, the linens, plates, food, cake, DJ, and coordinator (you can guess who that is!)  The other places we looked at had us paying twice that much just to rent the hall and have a dinner.\n\n Although we were worried about the room looking a little strange, and also being attached to a bar, when it gets all decked out (and they sure know how to dress the room!) it looks great, and the bar next door is great for that uncle that needs a little down-time or wants to check the scores, and doesn't intrude on the wedding at all!\n\nEveryone we worked with in conjunction with our reception was really great, the food was delicious (hard to do!), but covered in cheese.  The meat was cooked properly, the chicken wasn't dry, the salad crisp, and one of my bridesmaids was SO impressed with the Donna's potatoes she  wrote a thank-you note to the chef on a napkin!  \n\nThe cake was fantastic, and looked and tasted better than I thought it would!\n\nThe DJ was enthusiastic, and (quelle suprise!) has even won Best DJ awards for Las Vegas in 2011!\n\nI was so impressed with the way everything turned out, I didn't have to worry about a thing or come to anyone's rescue.  Thanks to the team at The Wedding Room, it was the first time on my wedding day I  could just relax and really enjoy myself.",4
review_185632,entertainment,"The first time I stayed here was in 2004 - about two years after it opened so everything was still new.  I've stayed here one weekend each summer since then.  It's hard to believe that it's been 8 years since my first visit but what can I say, I LOVE this resort.  \n\nThe valet, front desk and the bellhops were the nicest, respectful and most helpful people.  I can't say enough good things about them, so very friendly!\n\nMy last visit was for three days over Labor Day weekend and I was happy to see that everything inside of the resort is still in impeccable shape.  The pool area however was not as shiny as usual.  The umbrellas needed some repairs and the chairs were all sun bleached.  Another thing I didn't like was the inconsistency in the \""pool rules.\""  In previous stays, you weren't allowed to take the inner tubes out of the lazy river but this weekend, everyone was hording their tubes by their chairs, not only making it difficult to walk around but also forcing many people inside the lazy river to walk instead of float, it looked like a zombie walk.  Also, I like to bring a cooler bag with snacks and drinks because I'm literally at the pool from sun up to sun down and I won't pay $12 for a drink every time someone gets thirsty - everyone got ONE $12 drink a day, that it!  I've never had a problem with  bringing a cooler bag before but this year, some of the staff would allow it and others would not.\n\nI really like the packages that the resort offers, I was able to save a lot on Wi-Fi and resort fees just by going with a package - plus I got a $100 resort credit which was amazing.  I definitely recommend going with a package.  Also, if you're going to stay longer than one night, I recommend bringing a cooler - you can save a lot on drinks and snacks.  The resort offers a nice little market where you can pick up snacks but you're going to pay three times more than you would at a grocery store.  You can use ice from their ice machine to replenish the ice in your cooler.  It's easy to rack up a large bill at this resort, cutting corners helps.",4

To be honest, I've never even heard of this casino before and thought that it would be old and run down. It was probably old but it was huge, like a real casino. There were multiple bars and numerous restaurants. The front desk person was receptive and friendly. The lobby sofas were the most luxurious part of the casino. \n\nMy room was unexpectedly roomy. It looked like it was remodeled except for the old tubebox tv. The beds were very comfortable. On the other hand, the bathroom sink was clogged so whatever was in it, floated for hours. Pretty gross. \n\nThe hotel demographics is definitely a mucho older crowd, not my primary choice of people to hang out with. Overall experience here = meh, I've experienced better.",1
review_128895,entertainment,"My husband and I came here to gamble during our stay in Las Vegas.  Never again!  The service was just all around terrible.  We got carded about 10 times probably.

The guy that was there carded us, and then 5 minutes later he changed shifts with an older lady who carded us again right in the middle of our game!  Kind of ridiculous I thought.  She was just absolutely terrible.  She was rude and just so cold.  I think her name was Beth or Mary, from Colorado.  When we were finally done with gambling, she rudely told us to give us her chips to switch them out and she just simply threw the chips down at us and didn't even bother to say \""have a nice day.\""\n\nI can't imagine what this place is like as a hotel.",0
review_494413,entertainment,"I always wondered about this club and was excited to get tickets to see Kaskade for the second time here on St. Paddy's Day.  My cousin saw Kaskade here during his crazy set on NYE, he warned me to get bottle service next to the dance floor to make the best of the show, but I figured we could all just eventually get on the dance floor like other clubs, but boy was I freakin' wrong!\n\nFirst off, we got there around 1030 and got in right away, but the dance floor on the main floor was already ridiculously crowded and wouldn't let people into it already.  You can't stand around anywhere around the border of the main dance floor because all you can do is keep walking.  Outside of those walkways you can't really enjoy anywhere else inside because it isn't the dance floor and the main attraction effects don't even reach that area.  Basically, if you aren't set up for bottle service surrounding the dance floor your night is pretty much shot (unless you like standing around outside just listening to the music and watching the screen of the POV camera set up right behind the DJ)\n\nThe crowd that was there that night clearly didn't really know who they were listneing to because most of them seemed to be ignoring the music, and the few that did know the tracks being played or who the main DJ was for the night were outnumbered the vast amount that was just there for the scene.  What was hilarious was the amount of people who would run into our group looking for drugs or asked if we were looking to buy one of the escort girls they were pimpin' out to the random folks in the crowd.  Honestly, that was where I seriously found myself really close to walking out.  If it wasn't for the fact that I really enjoyed Kaskade's set, regardless of where I was standing at any given point of the night (since we were told to consistently keep moving)\n\nThe club is separated into three areas, a tiny ass Hip Hop room and a random spot called The Library, which I have no clue what its main purpose is.  Those other spots could be used in a different way since I feel that most people are on the main floor regardless.  Oh, and beware of all the stairs that you have to climb to get to the main club, and other floors.  It's going to be a journey!  However, the stairs are a great test of sobriety for those leaving the club at 4am.  I bet there are tons of photos and experiences of folks falling down them.\n\nIt really would take me a ridiculous amount of convincing to come back here and try this place out again, and the only way that would happen is if our squad gets bottle service that night.   However, I definitely would try this spot out as a DayClub, I'm assuming the experiences are different.  However, as a nightclub, this place is freakin' bananas.  The bouncers here I give props to, since they definitely doing their best to do what has to be done amongst all the craziness, but I feel that some of their work can be cut down by letting people go in N out of the dance floor.  Closing the dance floor does not help with the capacity on the floor.  I can easily see someone getting trampled if an emergency just happened to occur (which i hope never does).  \n\nLike I said, I'm down to go back and try this place out with no reservations in the daytime, but at night, its gonna take some convincing.  Until then, the nightclub gets the ending my cousin gave it at the end of the night, \""This Club is Whack!\""",1
review_258215,entertainment,"The light shows at night are the only reason this is a three star attraction.  Because other than the golden nugget, Fremont street is pretty bad.

We were there on sunday and they played a lot of 70's music (doors) which is alright by me.  \nMy wife and I stood in the middle of the street in awe of the light shows.  We just havent seen anything like that before.  It was even more interesting to stand at one end and watch so you could take in just how long the show is.  \nThe bad....well, fremont is considered old vegas, and apparently old vegas is dirty, smelly, and full of bums, alcoholics, and impersonators.

review_356556,entertainment,"This is place is like a stop, a stop where you get off if you want games. Hence Gamestation.\n\nGamestation is very well stocked, convenient game shop. Unsurprisingly it offers all the latest games, but more importantly a good selection of reasonably prices second hand games (which are often on sale). Its for this reason that Gamestation has also seemed to me better than its seemingly rival GAME. This Gamestation is particularly large and also offers retro fun, and video game spin off merchandise like T-Shirts and toys, which if you ask me are overpriced and marketed to a special kind of \""collector\"".\n\nYou might think that GAME, literally mere paces down the road, might make for stiff competition, but don't be fooled. GAME now owns Gamestation. If you want small independent game shops, you have to look hard. Fortunately Edinburgh has its very own \""Chips\"" on Nicholson Street.\n\nThe only real competition that Gamestation has is the online market, particularly second hand games from Amazon and Play, but as its stands it managing to compete on that front at least. And at least here you can browse, speak to real flesh and blood people, and sometimes come across great deals you weren't expecting.",3

review_75298,entertainment,"Recently caught a show at the (relatively) recently renovated Rex Theater, marking my first show there. I have to say, I'm a pretty big fan of the venue. As you enter, to the right there is a bar area and to the left a stage: A small, square room with a slightly slanted floor and a balcony behind it. Ideally the slanted floor should give shorter people in the back a better view, and I have to say that while I am a taller person, the view from the back was excellent, giving a full view of the stage.\n\nThe house lighting is decent and the soundsystem is LOUD for the space with great bass, which makes it pretty good for dance music and such. Unfortunately, I spent most of my time too close to the stage to actually hear how it sounded, so I can't comment on it being any better than loud.\n\nDidn't really notice the staff, which is always a good thing. They get a fairly decent variety of shows here as well, working with Grey Box Productions. Apparently they do some non-music events.\n\nDefinitely worth catching a show here, in a town with quite a few venues worth missing a show at.\n\nOh and venue capacity is probably about 500-600",3

I sat in the front and acted like I knew what I was doing.... but I didn't. It was fun anyway! Now you aren't supposed to get in the water and swim, and you probably don't want to anyway because yuck-o; but this doesn't stop water from getting onto you. Your rear-end will get wet in the kayak for sure.\n\nNext we tried the HYDRO-BIKES. The best invention ever! Riding a bike on water?! It was almost biblical... I felt quite stable and safe up out of the water. You'll never get wet on this thing unless someone rams into you. It's a bit hard to steer and control, but doesn't take long to get used to. Sooooooo fun.\n\nLastly we decided to paddleboard, which is something else I've never done. I stayed on my knees for a bit because I was honestly a bit horrified. I felt like I'd surely tumble into the water and embarrass everyone... plus, I was having a horrendous time trying to steer. No matter what I did, I just kept drifting further out to sea... For about 2 whole minutes I felt very dramatic and like I was probably lost forever. But then I got over it and stood up (easier to paddle for sure, duh), and rowed my way back home!\n\nA seriously fun time on Tempe Town Lake was had, and I thank Tempe Town Lake Boat Rentals for providing us with quality equipment, awesome service and staff (they held onto all of our belongings and even took several pictures of us being all sporty), and great prices. Woo!",4
review_556274,entertainment,"Such a great dog park!  They regularly rotate 3 areas of the park for big dogs and little dogs, so if you haven't been in awhile, you might be headed to a different area.  There's a couple fruit loops that frequent this park, but I've been to other dog parks in Vegas, and there's plenty to go around.  So happy I live across the street from this joint.",4
review_179982,entertainment,"This place was PACKED. We went late and kind of on a whim and so had to pay $20 cover but whatever. Literally, though, pressing your way through all those bodies was stressful. I thought the size and different levels were cool but I wasn't nearly drunk enough to enjoy it all. \n\nThe dance floor was a nightmare. Don't get me wrong, I had a good time, but there were SO MANY BODIES. And a couple incidents. Like some nearby rando definitely snuck his hand under my skirt and then smirked to his friend about it. And I got cornered by this black guy who wanted to do the most ridiculous dancing ever. On that note, if it weren't for the creepers/crowd the dance floor would have been my favorite in Vegas so far. There were crazy lights and if I remember correctly maybe even bubbles floating down from time to time. That and I was really feeling the music. \n\nBy the end of the night, though, I was so exhausted and delirious from my aching feet that when this guy walked up to us minutes after we left I immediately snapped \""What did you say?\"" when in fact he hadn't said anything at all yet, even though I would swear to this day that he had. He was all butt-hurt and walked away and I didn't even have the energy to feel bad about it. LOL oh well. Then outside the hotel some short a-hole named Amillion (I kid you not) spent like 20 minutes hitting on me/trying to get me to come back to his room at the STRATOSPHERE. Yeahhhh I'll pass on that buddy. \n\nOverall: \nDancing + Music + Venue = yes\nCreepers inside + Creepers outside + TOO MANY PEOPLE = no thanks\n\nBut worth a visit if you ask me.",2

review_381935,entertainment,"First and foremost, I would like to express my great gratitude to our very own Community Manager, Misti Y, for coordinating the LV yelpers to watch this show.  5 Stars for Misti Y. Woohoo as good as it gets! \n\nNow, back to the show. I was really disappointed. Regardless if I was 10 minutes late, I felt that the show wasn't Cirque du Soleil. I have seen Mystere a zillion times and each time I am always amused as if it is my first time.  Zummanity is my favorite.  Viva Elvis felt like it was a Jubilee show or something else other than Cirque and I was not in awe at all. \n\nTrust me I like Elvis. When I was a child back in my home country, I believed and grew up thinking that I was coming to America to marry Elvis Presley (little did I know then that he has been deceased for many years! LOL!) So I was a little crushed last night when the show wasn't really what I expected to be.... I expected Elvis Presley and not a bunch of singers and dancers lip syncing to his songs.  Even the acrobats were not up to par as what Cirque is all about.\n\nThe music production was also diluted because of how old the music was and each time a different song would come on the levels were off and at one point, it became really loud which almost blew our ear drums. \n\nThe things that I liked were the jumpers dressed in super hero outfits and the fact that they showed Young Elvis alot, still I wished that Cirque worked their magic and brought him back....maybe my expectations are high but it is Cirque du Soleil!!!",1

I hate driving downtown and really am not into drinking and driving especially since a drunk driving conviction would mean loss of my job.  Once on the train, I was happy to see the trains were still in perfect condition and like new.  My biggest complaint is the honor system for paying the fare.  I sometimes feel like I am the only one paying the fee.  I had never had anyone ask for my ticket until tonight.  Two uniformed Mesa police officers and someone I think was a light rail employee came into the car and starting asking people for their tickets. The best moment came when this guy in the back  did not have a ticket and the officers removed him in a most impolite way.  It was great!",3

review_374825,entertainment,"I stayed one night at Aria, on opening night, and checked out most of the bars and common areas in the place.  The room was quite nice and very high tech.  Like the rest of the hotel, decor is muted and brownish.  Walking in, the curtains open to do a reveal of the view over the strip (Bellagio is a few buildings away) and the other City Center buildings/pool. Music started playing etc...it was actually very cool. You can customize everything and save your profile so the temperature/music/lighting etc will be ready for your next visit.  You can also do fun things like set your wake-up to: warm up to x temperature, gradually turn the lights up, open the curtains and play 80's pop.  Ha!\nThe bathtub is killer and the shower sucks...they took the water conservation shower-head a bit too far.  Products kind of suck but they'll bring you free hairspray and other extras...i.e. lots of selection.\nBed, minibar, desk, all great, room was quiet with no traffic noise so i think the windows were well sealed and built.  \nThe hotel is overall a bit boring...very brown and tan, someone said it felt more like the Hong Kong airport which I have never seen. It's nice, but not as cool looking as the Wynn's, Bellagio.  But, it's more relaxing too.  Kind of reminded me of a more grown-up boring Palms and THEHotel.  The lobby and common area lighting is a bit bright and not sexy.  \nThere were some nice looking shops, a colorful snack store, Union Bar was cool, Gold Lounge was great, City Bar too.  I'd love to try the Michal Mina restaurant...which had a wicked cool cactus garden in the hallway outside.  The casino looked appealing and not too garish or loud, very tasteful.  \nThe gym was nice, though the selection of cardio equipment annoyed me.  No decent ellipticals for example.  The treadmill was cool though; it had an adjustable fan to cool you off which is great in the dry weirdness of vegas.  Machines were very nice, staff was excellent.  The spa looked great though I only went in to get the fresh fruit and juice. \n\nOverall, I wasn't blown away but the place is classy and tasteful, probably very appealing to yuppies.  Rooms are new and very nice so if the price is right I'd definitely stay there over Venetian, Bellagio or other aging more trashed hotels.  I'll check out the nightclub Haze when it opens too.\nSince we were there celebrating opening night, I received some complimentary desserts in my room.....and the chocolate creation was one of the most outrageously delicious things I have ever tasted!!  They have a really famous pastry chef with a french sounding name, and a fancy chocolate/candy/cake store in the casino.  The chocolate was all shaped and dusted in gold, and the white chocolate had silver glitter on it....and it was SO, so, so good that I took most of it home for my husband, which is something I NEVER do.....save leftovers let alone take them on a plane home...it was just that good!! Check out the chocolate shop!",3
review_179819,entertainment,"This is an awesome club!  If you have a group (we had 7 guys for a birthday party weekend) get a table and bottle service.  Tao's VIP service team is the best in the city.  We got a table up at the Tao Beach pool area with access to the regular club as well.  Our two waitresses were total sweethearts and everybody in the group had a ball.  Things got pretty blurry as the night wore on, but that will happen when you order 4 bottles of Goose (that's Geese)......",4
review_159694,entertainment,"Here is all you need to know: if you want to stay out and party all night and not sleep in your room, the Palms will suit you. As it turned out, I wanted to get some sleep. The floor that I was on featured two rooms of loud partiers. Security eventually came by and tried to shut them up, but it was a night of restless sleep. Upon checkout I mentioned this to the desk clerk. He was clearly not interested and I think wanted to tell me, \""It's the Palms, get over it!\"" While the rooms aren't terrible, the features of the hotel, including the restaurants, do not make a stay off the Strip worth it.",1

Like most clubs, it's rotating da but when we were there, they weren't good.

review_343011,entertainment,"This review is for 2 parts - the Day club/brunch and the Night club!\n\n1) Day club brunch: My girls and I showed up for the day club (dancing only, no food) on St. Patty's day and was promptly whisked in. The biggest drawback is the layout of Lavo (the first floor at least). The majority of the space was taken up by diners (with amazing smelling food) and thus left almost no space to dance. My group of 8 found a small space underneath the dancer girl in bathtub (don't ask...she was hot though). \n\nMusic was solid (mostly house). Drinks were standard price ($14?) and the free green ish being passed around was an added plus. Green foam sticks, green glow sticks, green shamrock head gear - the works! We were next to the go-go dancers and we could not stop drooling at this one mixed Asian chick. She was weeeeeerking it! I'm in love. \n\n2) Returned later that evening with our cute little Asian promoter. She walked us in, got us a table near the bar and a round of drinks! We started dancing on the couch before a bouncer stopped us ... and told us to dance on the ledge instead! There is a cushion on the couch that can be removed and the sweet waitresses told us to keep all our purses in there! So accommodating :') Music was mainly hip-hop, so definitely got back to my roots. \n\nLavo is a solid part of my Vegas club rotations :) Definitely check it out!",3

My husband and I held our wedding at the Ravella. We got an amazing package that included use of the wedding chapel, spa services and hotel rooms. The staff and the wedding coordinator were so friendly and accommodating. All of our guests raved about the hotel and its amenities. We stayed in Vegas on Friday night and so many of our guests wished that we had stayed at the Ravella both nights. The guests that did stay both nights were glad that they did. The resort grounds are beautiful and the spa had great deals that many of our guests took advantage of. I would highly recommend this hotel to anybody that wants to have a relaxing night away from the Vegas strip. It was also a great place to get married, the chapel was beautiful and the spa was super accommodating",4

This small casino on the 50 ish floor of the new fantasy tower of the Palms is really amazing. Yes, there are bunnys, and yes there are expensive drinks and bottles, but hey this is Vegas and its redundant but always necessary. The elevator factor is kind of a bummer just like moon, where you can't get in or out easily one must wait for one of two elevators to get you out of there, but if you prepare and know your going to devote a couple hours to it, its worth the scenery!!",2

review_319334,entertainment,"In watching a bunch of shows in Vegas one thing is evident... audiences know talent when they see it. Terry Fator has loads of it for a guy who not only has exceptional ventriloquist abilities, a pretty good singing voice, and up-to-date comedic material. Terry has been doing this for 5 years on the strip and with another packed crowd last night it goes to show you the added charm will hopefully keep him around for another 5 years. \n\nAs many others have said.. in the beginning he did start off with an original song of his to show that he indeed CAN sing to prove a point. Then he goes into a stint with his turtle sidekick leaving for Hollywood. In my mind this was heading into \""cheesy\"" territory. I can only imagine what it would've been like to bring a hot date to this show and have her give me that side glance and in her mind say \""This damn fool brought me to the Vegas muppets show..smh\"" \n\nAfter getting past the opening act, I then realize why Terry Fator is not just a one man headliner, I realize why the darn theater is named after him. Some of the best acts were on the way and what started with a half a smirk when into a full on laugh out loud episode. The jokes didn't seem redundant and they really were meant for all ages and groups. He toed the line of being crude but never to the point where people mistaken his show for Absinthe. For the most part, the jokes can perhaps fly over the head of kids and yet there are jokes strictly for kids. It was a great balance. \n\nOne shtick that I have seen on Youtube was even funnier in person. The Elvis was the closing puppet and rightfully so. The entire bit was pretty much the 101 of comedy and Terry flawlessly delivers it. The crowd was thundering at that point. \n\nFor all the talent that Terry Fator has, I believe he has some duty to give back to others. I believe you can call it a relief act in dedicating two songs to a child who passed away and military. I respect Terry for making an effort to change the pace of the show for the betterment of a cause, but those two segments completely brought the energy down of the crowd. You can tell the life was slowly sucking out of each and every one of us as the song kept going. Like the opening song.. somehow his originals are just not interesting for the audience. But that's where talent again shines as he does not fail in bringing back the laughs and applause with the proceeding act. Some performers can lose audiences for good but Terry does it with no regret and knows he's got the audience in the palm of his hand. \n\nAll in all.. I would say a really great show, that can be cheesy (sometimes for the better of the show) that displays pure talent and skill. At the end he got a standing ovation from everyone. Get past the beginning and his originals and you'll still have a great wholesome performance from one of Vegas' best showman!",3

review_182985,entertainment,"This is the private club inside House of Blues at Mandalay Bay.  The d\u00e9cor and ambiance in this restaurant are top notch.  When you add in the view from the balcony, this is the most visually spectacular restaurant in Las Vegas...nothing else even close.  The service is also outstanding and if you are an actually member of this private club (I was a guest), prepare to receive very personalized service.    You will feel like a rock star whether you're eating, drinking or just smoking a cigar (yes, they sell them to smoke on the outdoor balcony) at this awesome restaurant.  The food is also really good, but not as \""stand out\"" as the ambiance and service.  It is an expensive place, but if you're a member, you'll receive a 20% discount...but it's still expensive.  I had the lamb shank which was delivered without any room for improvement.  Our table also had sides of creamy spinach, macaroni and cheese, and risotto.  All the sides were delicious.  My wife had the pork chop, which she thought was a little dry and over cooked, but still flavorful.  The members we went had the pork chop (which he also thought was dry, but flavorful) and the horseradish crusted tenderloin (which she thought was slightly overcooked).  Overall, the food was really good, but there is room for improvement.  Food-4 stars, Ambiance-5+ stars, Value-4 stars, Service-5+.  I know my average is not really 5 stars, but I'm giving the Foundation Room 5 stars because the ambiance, patio view and service were unsurpassed.",4

review_606613,entertainment,"I had high hopes for the \""new\"" Gold Spike.  Last time out, it was a run-down casino with little excitement inside.  Now, it's a nicely renovated gaming establishment.  By \""gaming\"", I mean the bag toss games, giant chess & Jenga, etc.  No casino games that we could find.  That was a bit puzzling, but we accepted that soon after arriving.\n\nThe place wasn't crowded by any means, but all the games were occupied.  That created a very strange atmosphere.  What do you do there when all the games are taken up?  Belly up to strangers and declare \""I got next!\""?  Meh.  Sit at a table with a beer while you talk a game waiting for folks to leave?  Hmph.\n\nThis place has a lot of promise.  The concept is solid, but the execution needs to be worked on.  There's a lot of open space for people to mull around, but there's nothing to DO for those folks.  There could easily be some blackjack tables in areas, or some slot banks.  Clearly, gambling isn't a priority here.  And that's fine, but it feels strange.  More games (bags, shuffleboard, etc.) could get more people to stick around longer.  We hung around for one beer, a game of bags, then blew out of there.\n\nThe crowd tended to be more of the younger, \""hipster\"" crowd.  Perhaps if that's your thing, you'd rate this higher.  I yearned for more availability, more fun, more action, and some excitement.  The band that was playing was pretty decent.",2

So I checked in and went to the bar.\n\nI was disappointed first of all that the bartender needed me to walk to the front desk (or concierge?..can't remember exactly which one) in order to redeem the coupon...and then come all the way back.  However, I was more disappointed when I got there and the supervisor REFUSED to help me.  She apparently was closing out and leaving and told me to come back in the morning.\n\nRegardless, I asked her to please find a way...after a long drive I really just wanted to relax for a bit and take advantage of an offer that I was excited to use...this was to no avail.  Further I was VERY frustrated at the fact that the coupon explicitly says 'valid until 1:58am'...it was only 11pm.  \n\nI really did not appreciate the fact that I was treated this way ESPECIALLY by a supervisor.  Her demeanor was overall rude and annoyed despite the fact that I was calmly explaining to her my situation.    \n\nI've never had someone that is in charge of hotel operations huff and puff at me as I talk, it was really bizarre.  \n\nIn terms of the room we had, it wasn't bad-for 100 bucks a night it was a good deal...we only stayed there 1 night though and headed to a suite at Aria.",1

This is needed because without any better way to describe the crowd, I found them scary at times.  I was not too crazy about the music here- the first two hours we were there, I swear the DJ must have gotten his hands on my freshman year playlist (let's just say that I graduated more than 5 years ago).

I did like the view from the club, it is beautiful to see all the lights away from the strip. Music was OK. At one point the DJ was playing oldies??? what??? \n\nBut on a positive note the bartender was awesome. I never waited more than a minute to order and get my champagne. He was cute as well. I also like that you have access to the playboy club. I didn't get to spend much time down there but it looked like a lot of fun.",1

I've tried many other studios, and i have to say that this one is probably the most consistently great yoga studio in pittsburgh. The staff is friendly and the instructors are knowledgable. It's a killer workout with an added bonus of being a much needed stress reliever. Namaste!",4

review_179874,entertainment,"Saturday night of Memorial Day weekend was HORRIBLE!! We had to wait in line for about 30-45 minutes. Then right as we enter we were directed up several flights of stairs to Tao Beach. Uhhhh we didn't want to go here, we wanted the club! We go straight to the bar and it's complete madness and so with the dance floor. We manage to find the way downstairs and there's a line for that too! \n\nMost of the time there we stayed in the smaller room playing more hip hop. The DJ was the worst ever! He would start playing a hook to one song then right as we were starting to get into the groove of things he would change it to a different song. Seriously?! You're really going to just play only like 10 seconds of a song??\n\nWe tried to go into the main room but that was just a disaster and ended up back in the smaller room. This was my second time at this club and I remember it being pretty crowded but this was waaayy out of hand. I'm sure they were way over the capacity. \n\nYou can guarantee I'm never coming back here!",0
review_181536,entertainment,2.5 stars\n\nBest thing about this place is its view!!! Cons are that is off from the strip as it is located in the Palms hotel. If you are not a guest of the hotel expect to pay to get in EVEN IF YOU ARE A GIRL!!!! Girls $20 and Guys $25. Bouncers are very friendly and helpful. Drink are over and cover are over priced. Not too busy. Smaller venue. Thanks but no thanks Ghostbar.,2

review_133433,entertainment,This is fun casino; its kind of old and run down a little but they have a lot of fun events here and it always draws a crowd. \n\nThe Roller Derby Events are here; Andrew Dice Clay is here as well as their comedy club (I've been to it a half dozen times or so and have seen some good acts at the club) I can't speak to the rooms but the staff I've encountered are always very accommodating; their Valet service is convenient and very fast.  \n\nTheir food court deserves a solid B rating the food selection is top notch (but could be cleaner as many people trash their tables and walk away) I've eaten at three of the different stores here and was pleased with the quality and price. \n\nThey have a mini Pinball exhibit on loan from the Pinball Hall of Fame that is good for kids and fun for the adults who are tired of playing the slots. My High scores stay on the machines and that makes me very happy. \n\nLooking forward to my next trip here as we always have a blast!,3

review_381669,entertainment,"Solid-ish sportsbook, if you're not drinking or eating. Lots of screens, seating isn't exactly comfortable but there are two or three different types of chair styles to pick from as well as booth-style seating along the back wall.\nNothing different from any other 'book for placing your bets. Sometimes you'll luck into a free drink coupon with your bet though, which is a plus.\n\nBut the bartenders in that particular area are surly and rude- coming up to get a drink to two guys standing together, one rolled his eyes at me and gestured to the other bartender when I tried to place my order. Not sure if he was the bar back and not the bartender proper, or if he was off the clock, or just didn't want to deal with me, but an eye roll is not the way to handle that.\n\nAnd $9 for a bottle of Corona is bullshit. Expected, but still bullshit.",1

Our pilot didn't travel the balloon outside a short block radius while all th other ballons got a ton of altitude and distance.\n\nI would never suggest a hot air balloon ride to anyone in phx. Save it for Sedona or some other location that is much more scenic. I would suggest staying on the ground and watching them in the sky.,0
review_356740,entertainment,"As a resident of Edinburgh, I thought it was about time I discovered some of the more out of the way parts of the city.\nOverall, I was slightly disappointed with what could have been a very interesting tour of Mary King's close.\nThere's far too much emphasis on the amateur dramatics of having guides dressed in period costume and sound effects rather than historical facts and the wider use of the area (the fact that parts were used as an air-raid shelter during WWII was barely mentioned).\nMaybe having two different tours, a \""spooky\"" and a \""factual\"" with the relevant commentary might be a good compromise?\nParts of the tour are VERY badly lit, particularly some of the doorways and areas with steps, the floor is also very uneven in places. I appreciate that the darkness adds to the atmosphere but our guide's statement that \""your eyes will get accustomed to it\"" was negated by the relatively bright lighting in some areas/rooms. I had a small torch with me, to help my wife and I navigate some of the potential hazards, but was asked to turn it off. A couple of the other members of our group were walking with the aid of sticks and looked like they were having great difficulty in places (which our guide missed/ignored).\nIt was disappointing to not be allowed to take photos during the tour...which seems a bit petty when they have bothered to set up scenes such as the plague doctor visiting patients and dressing rooms with artefacts...you do get to pose for an infrared photo, standing in Mary King's Close, at the end of the tour (with the option of buying an over-priced copy from the gift-shop).",2
review_280196,entertainment,"Dirty Pretty is a fun place to go to, especially to listen to some live music. To be honest, I do not compare it to bars such as Suede, PCL, etc, because it is simply not the same. \n\nIs the crowd similar? Yes. Younger, more Scottsdale-like. Yes. If you don't like that \""vibe\"", I would suggest to stay away as you will most likely not be able to look past that. If you can look past the lame stereotype, I think you will have an awesome time.\n\nThe music is awesome. Live and loud, the way it should be. Last time I checked I like my live music loud.

Good drink specials with local beers on tap, service was very slow, had to wait a while for the waitress to come around for the order and refills.  The food itself was very average to below average, bland and not exactly fresh.  Would be a fun place to watch a game, have a few beers, eat elsewhere.",1

review_207360,entertainment,"Gilley's really was a lot of fun.  They have a good deal on a bucket of beers and the food is decent (although expensive for what it is).  The best part about Gilley's is definitely the mechanical bull.  I popped my mechanical bull cherry here; I was really nervous but it was a lot of fun, I was even able to stay on for a good minute or so.  \n\nWe went to the Bikini Bull Riding contest they have on Sundays, and even though most of the girls seemed like legit volunteers, I know at least one of them worked there.  She's blonde, and they pulled her out of the crowd and she said it was her 21st birthday and that she hadn't ridden a mechanical bull in a very long time.  She then proceeded to strip down and ride the bull like a pro.  She hasn't ridden it in a very long time?  I saw her there the night previous to that riding it and then doing some well-choreographed line dancing.  This girl clearly works at Gilley's in some capacity.  Which is fine, I understand that they need to have some kind of a \""show\"" for this type of thing, but what bothers me is the girl made it to the final 3!  What if she had won?  You're going to give the cash prize to an employee?  I'm still skeptical on whether this contest was rigged or not.  It's a shame.",2
review_418687,entertainment,"As a local I try to avoid the Strip at all costs, especially on the weekends.  Saturday, I made an exception and came to Gold Lounge at Aria for the first time.  The reason: my cousin was turning 30 and had driven out from San Diego for the weekend.\n\nTo be honest, I read a couple of random reviews prior to writing mine, and I have to say... some people are harsh! They complain about prices and about bouncers/hosts discriminating based on looks.  HI. Welcome to Vegas! Get over it.  If you cant afford $15 drinks and $20+ cover then you're in the wrong city or hanging with the wrong crowd.  That being said... on to my review.\n\nI arrived around 130 am and had no problem getting in.  I mentioned I was local, they gave me a little ticket thing and I walked right in.  I saw 1 large bar, a smallish dance \""area\"" and several tables (all \""reserved\"" of course).  The music was decent (hip-hop and radio hits) when I arrived but switched to some annoying house-y techno an hour later (I guess they had switched over to their after-hours theme).\n\nMajor Downsides:\n-Nowhere to sit and cool your heels even though they claim to be a \""lounge\"".  They kicked my companions off a \""reserved\"" table even though the prior occupants left a good half-hour earlier and no one else was waiting for bottle service.\n-Unisex restrooms...and only 4 stalls.\n-annoying switch to house music \n\nUpsides:\n-no wait and no cover... at least for me.\n-I didnt see any priority placed on girls dressed like hoochies. There was a nice mix in the crowd.\n\nBottom Line:\nI had an alright experience. Not stellar. Not terrible. But I'm a n9ne girl at heart; I'll stick to my clubs and lounges at the Palms ;)",2

review_341809,entertainment,"You can't miss strolling through Vieux Port and Vieux Montreal on a visit to the city.  It's not spectacular, but it is something absolutely lovely.  Just the walk through Vieux Montreal is soul-warming itself (loved the narrow streets, and old cobblestone paths), and then arriving at the Port is a pleasant ending to the walk.  I was there on a sunny day in the tail end of summer, and it was filled with rollerskaters/bladers, bicyclists, joggers, walkers, a military band, pets, and simply a great vibe to be in.  The narrow park that lines sort of the center of the walk along the port, is also beautiful this time of year.  Lots of green and orange.  \n\nThe port/water itself is just like any other bod of water.  There are navy ships docked, and also an apartment complex across the water that used to be the \""projects\"", but are today, luxury apartments. :)",4

Why yes we say who doesnt love a free ride.  We get there he hooks us up with a suburban and drives up back to our hotel all for free.  We tipped him about $40 for his help but u cant beat that service.  I think the shuttle driver gave him the impression we were staying there and we didnt confirm nor deny.  But talk about service.

review_452438,entertainment,"It's nice to finally see a live music venue that's in the mid range capacity wise. For too long it's either been a choice of the larger Corn Exchange or smaller Liquid Rooms. As the name suggests this building was formally a gorgeous art deco theatre/cinema. Thankfully it's new owners have restored or kept the original fittings which makes the place feel classier than a hell of a lot of other gig venues. \n\nThe stalls area makes up the main standing area of the venue which is great as it slopes down towards the stage making it much easier for short people like me to get a good view even towards the back. The bass is pretty epic in this place too; at my first gig here to see Explosions in the Sky I could actually feel it reverberating up through the soles of my feet. \n\nIf you don't feel like scrumming it in the standing area there is seating available in a balcony area upstairs. However this is often reserved as a VIP lounge so don't count on actually getting up there. The 2 main bars downstairs are well staffed so you don't have to spend too much time away from the stage in order to quench your thirst. (Though the drinks are a touch on the expensive side.) \n\nObviously a lot of reviews will be won or lost on the quality of the acts playing, thankfully they manage to secure really decent acts. The last gig I saw there was M83 who were brilliant and just shone in a more intimate setting like the HMV Picture House. \n\nOf course if your favourite band in the world is playing you probably aren't going to care where they play. You'd still go even if the place wasn't as nice as here. At least here you get to enjoy great music and a great venue.",3

review_201833,entertainment,"So my aunt is visiting from small town Ohio and its restaurant week and I wanted to take her somewhere really cool that would knock her socks off. I hadn't been to the Compass Grill since it was the Compass Room like 10 years ago. But its a rotating restaurant and they sure as hell dont have those in Ohio! \n\nI made reservations through Opentable and requested a window table for our party of 4, which was honored. When we arrived we valet parked because really where do you park in downtown Phoenix? At that point it sure would have been rad if they would have told us it was going to cost $11 to valet! I have valeted my car at numerous restaurants around the valley and its always been complimentary if you were eating at their establishment....Clearly the Hyatt nor the Compass AZ Grill believe in this. (Minus 1 star right there, its like charging a cover to step foot through the doors) \n\nService was generally pretty slow, and there were hardly any tables there, I am going to say that there were MAYBE 15 other tables. The food was decent but far from mind blowing. It was really pretty average and I am glad we went during restaurant week so we didn't have to pay the higher normal prices, because I would have been pretty upset over the meal. \n\nWe put our dessert orders in when we placed our whole meal order (You get 3 courses during RW) After our dinner plates were cleared it took over 20-30 minutes to bring out dessert, kinda crazy. BUT they were very tasty, I will give them that. \n\nAll in all it was an OK experience. I didn't have a terrible time but I will probably never go back either. Its cool to take out of towners to because the place rotates and you can see the whole city (Go just before sunset, its wicked!) Also as you rotate there are little plaques posted telling you about the buildings and scenery.",2

Their food was fast at the cost of tasting like being under a heat lamp for three hours.  For being mostly empty, it was mostly under-served.  Even the TVs were on the fritz.    Worst of all, most of the cafe is shut down!  Not that I really like NASCAR, I'm just saying.  \n\nThat the Sahara is now known more for a baby-sized burrito than Louie Prima makes me a sad person.",1

No lie, the bartender touched me, with a fake arm.  You know, the ones you buy from Halloween stores that have blood on the top like it was chopped off.  Fitting right?\n\nCome to Jekyl and Hyde were everyday is Halloween, for realz!

I squabbled a little, but hubby happily dished it over and we got our tickets. Vegas is particularly slow in March and the weather was eh, so there was not a line. When we went to board our Gondola, the couple in front of us (who was getting off of the gondola) was raving about how great it is and how they got a private ride because there wasn't anyone else in line. Really? I can understand having to pay an upcharge if you want a private ride, but everyone should have to pay not just some. I did not think it was fair.

Booked a corner 2 room suite. I had one room to myself, 2 kids staid in the living room and 2 in the other bedroom. \n\nWhy so good with kids -- the pools. Other hotels have little gimmicks that are fun for a few minutes but the wave pool at Mandalay was enough to entertain this crew actively all day! The lazy river pool is fun as well especially swimming against the current.

The Golden Nugget goes for more of the glitzy/opulent vibe while we are more fans of modern/clean/simplistic, but we could appreciate the decorations for what they were. Terrible tv channel offerings, but I suppose most people are out gambling and boozing it up and aren't like boring old us, who were in bed by 10pm.

We went to their Eiffel Tower Restaurant for dinner at the recommendation of a friend. I requested the Beef Wellington. The waitress had never heard of such a thing. Really, true story.

review_551000,entertainment,"This was a tough 4 star for me. Could have been a 5-star, but for 2 things.\n\nPros:\nGreat atmosphere. Not a KISS fan, but loved the black lit course and the music/vibe.\n\nModerately difficult course. Some challenges, but not Phil Michelson level.\n\nRound of golf and a beer for $13? One of the best deals in Vegas far as I am concerned. Plus, $2-3 for additional beers. Nice.\n\nFree Game for the loser in your group. I am terrible so that was me and it made me feel good about getting beat.\n\nFriendly, chill staff. Always a plus at a place like this.\n\nCons:\nNeed a place to put your beverage down while playing other than the floor/obstacles. This is a disaster waiting to happen. By putting beers on the floor, they can potentially spill onto the course or on the obstacles. Just a bit awkward really.\n\nThere was a kids' party while we were there. I fully understand that these kiddie parties are vital places like this. But it is a bit distracting and annoying when some of these rug-rats are running as your feet when putting and their bewildered soccer moms are looking at you like 'why are you in my special child's way of going 9-iron on a putting course?' (sorry I rambled, but it wasn't pleasant for a few holes).\n\nI would certainly come back again.

review_123272,entertainment,"This is the new default theater for the wife and I as its the closest to our home. We've been a handful of times and at all various hours and days of the week. \nAs far as Vegas movie theaters go, I'd say this one is pretty average and slightly mediocre. The location is pretty good for a in casino theater because its pretty quick and easy to get to. Its a good location inside the theater because once you get up the stairs and see that the only other things in that area are the day care and the arcade, you are usually greeted by the \""fresher\"" air because of the lack of smoking.\nThe ticket prices are about average. Not the cheapest (see the Henderson Cinedome for cheap first run movies) and its not the most expensive. They don't seem to offer any discounts, at least my wife who is a student hasn't gotten one by flashing her ID. The theaters are pretty clean, and never insanely busy. I've found that at this theater parents are bit less likely to bring their young children to an R movie...maybe its because the daycare is right next to the theater? This theater does have the Real 3D if you are in to that. \nThey have the two sided concession counter, which I've only ever seen one side open, which can be a pain when you have to wait to go through the popcorn line just to get to the cashier. \nThe only thing that I am not a fan of is the ticket line. Even when its busy on a Friday or Saturday night, they never seem to have more than 2 people working the ticket counter. I don't really know if I've experienced a slower ticket counter. \nIf you are looking for top of the line technology and service, this is not your place. If you are looking for an easy theater that is not as crazy busy as Town Square or Red Rock...this could be for you.",2

review_28021,entertainment,"I'm not a big bowler, but when friends want to bowl, I'm down. I've been to this location a few times and I'm not impressed. Where do I start?\n\nHOURS: You'll see hours listed here on Yelp, and some different ones on their website, and some on the door to the business, but when you actually go in and try to bowl the employees tell you earlier times. They informed us that management is trying to save money so they have the employees close early. It was disappointing to think we had 2 hours to bowl according to the website, then actually have less than an hour. \n\nPRICES: We bowled on a Saturday night for $15/person which included 2 hours of bowling and shoe rental. It went slightly into the fun ultimate bowling or whatever they call it here. The kind w music, fun lights, etc... We had some beer at almost $20 a pitcher, which is kind of expensive. On Tuesday, we weren't really sure what the price was. It kind of seemed like the employees weren't sure how much to charge us for only being able to bowl for 45 minutes because they were closing early. They decided between each other to charge us a total of $10.66 for everything (2 people & shoes). They didn't know how to ring it up though, which led us even further to suspect that this was just a price they made up on the spot.\n\nLOCATION: Unfortunately this alley is located in a questionable part of town. On Sat night there were some creepy looking people loitering in the parking lot. I imagine that if the INSIDE attracted better people, then the outside wouldn't be as creepy.\n\nSo...I'll probably try to find a nicer bowling alley nearby if possible and will encourage friends to go elsewhere too.\n\nIf your'e the owner or manager, please read on:\n\nI saw several ways that an employer could cut costs to save money without having inconsistent hours. \n-Turn some lights off: if people are only using 4 or 5 lanes, and you're not allowing them to be spread out even if requested (we requested a lane away from other rowdy bowlers but were given a lane RIGHT between them) then turn lights off on the other 90% of the lanes not in use. Or turn off every other one for 1/2 the building. I don't know how the electric is set up, but it might be worth getting it set up to be able to do this.\n- Cut staffing down: There were more employees working than lanes being used. That's ridiculous. 4 people working to run credit cards, hand out shoes, and spray them down after they're turned in? That's a 1 person job IF that person knows what to do. Maybe 2 are needed for safety and for the instances where one has to walk down a lane to fetch a ball or something. If the concession guy is closing early, that's a whole additional person who is being paid to stand around, but isn't available to make you money.\n-Turn off the video games early: that sucks tons of electricity and if nobody is even remotely interested in using them why have them on? You could leave a sign saying to ask an employee if you want to use the games and they'll turn them on. \n-Turn down the AC: it was freeeeezing in there. I think the temp could be turned up at least 4or 5 degrees which doesn't seem like much, but in a place that size might be a huge monetary savings.\n-Prevent theft: I think in order to prevent people suspecting they might be getting ripped off, and to prevent employee theft, you should just have listed prices and signage that gives that info in black and white. It made us uncomfortable to just have the employees throw out a price that seems random like $10.66 for 2 people for 45 minutes.\n-Offset the cost of operation by selling drinks and food! When we were there, the concession stand lights were off and they stopped serving everything at least 1/2 hour before the closing time which was an hour and a half before the posted closing time. Nobody had the opportunity to buy overpriced bowling alley food or beer. Big mistake management. Big.\n\nI never think that closing early is good for a business. You're the boss though and I guess you can do what you want, but at least have some respect for customers by listing times as \""may vary by night and number of customers at employee discretion\"" so that we have fair warning that we might not get to stay until the advertised times. It sucks to arrive somewhere to find that out.",1
review_597047,entertainment,"In one night I checked out three clubs. Hakkasan is the third club my friends and I visited and am I glad we went!\n\nTommy Trash was the DJ of the night.\n\nGot in free... I don't remember how...But we did. Got to ride in the elevator to go up and from there, there are stairs. The security are nice but don't mistake one for a random guy that wants to hold your hand.\n\nDrinks are expensive. Already learned that you should PREGAME. Water = $9, WHAT? And no they do not offer a cup of water.\n\nIf I remember correctly there's two to three floors. To get access to their stage you need another wristband. With the DJ playing there's a block off like a concert with security guards making sure nobody passes that line.\n\nLoved the lights and there were dancers! They had cool outfits on but I couldn't see much since I'm tiny.\n\nMain dance floor in the middle, there are ramps/stairs to go to to get to it.

review_580276,entertainment,"I so badly want to love this place ... The concept of having a restaurant and gaming area inclusive, being a supporter of bicycles, and literally RIGHT around the corner from my residence sounds like the perfect neighborhood bar! \n\nHowever, I am disappointed in the service every time I go. Watching paint dry is a faster process than ordering a cocktail, and the bartenders seem more interested in each other than the customers. I loved the cocktail named \""Room service\"" but I only had time to order one before my bill came at midnight; I showed up at 1030 ... Then, I was charged for 2 drinks on my tab!!! I'm not sure what their hiring standards are, but I've gone to the Yard different times of the day and have been utterly disappointed in the service Every.Single.Time. It really is quite a shame ... If they are going for a hipster version of \""Dicks\"" where they treat everyone like crap as part of the experience, then I wish I would at least get a paper-made hat with a clever saying on it!",1

My husband really wanted to go here so I humored him and we did just that, luckily it was after 9pm on a Thursday so parking was easy enough to find and we didn't have to pay, but any other time I can see the HUGE draw back. \n\nThere were the drunk pretentious Vegas/LA type people who are only their to drink and be seen. Most of the shops were closed, except for the food and beverage scene. Not impressed at all. Pricing like that of The Strip, which I guess means it is normally overrun with tourons. If I want that experience i'll go a few blocks over to Fremont or down to The Strip. \n\nNOT going back if I can help it.",1

If you're into rock and roll and want a fun quick excursion from the strip, this def fits the bill.   The mini golf itself kinda sucks just an FYI.",3
review_317336,entertainment,"There is a lot of hype about this place and although it is a good time, it is not very different than any of the other pool parties in Vegas, but with a lot more expense.\n\nOne piece of advice though, DO NOT OPEN A BAR TAB ESPECIALLY IN THE CABANA BOTTLE SERVICE AREA.  They will over charge you for drinks that you either did not order or that are different than the posted menu rates at the venue and shown on their website.  This is how the waitresses make their money.  Do not tip before you get the bill.  They will add it to your bill anyways and deny the cash you forked over earlier in the day. If you dispute the charges, they will threaten to arrest you with Vegas PD at the premises.  You do not need this kind of argument at the end of what you thought was an enjoyable day.  And the MGM will not get involved to help settle the dispute unless you charge your bill through your room.\n\nSpread the word fellow Yelpers, its not worth the trouble or expense.",0

review_412342,entertainment,"Haze is small, dark, and crowded, much like every other club in Vegas that's not Marquee or XS. I think my experience was much more fun than some of the other reviewers because there was no cover and the promoter gave us a lot of free drink tickets. Without the tickets, the drinks would have been pretty expensive.\n\nAnyways, the club was super tiny and hot, but I went with a fun group of people, so we had a good time just dancing stupid. Met some friendly people, took advantage of the drink tickets, and had a fun time. The go-go dancers were kind of funny. I think they were trying to be sexy, given that they weren't wearing very much, but I guess I find the idea of go-go dancers to be kind of hilariously absurd, so there's that.",2
review_200104,entertainment,"A group of eight of us was wandering the streets of the Strip, wondering where to go, and all of a sudden somebody approached us and told us about The Bank. Having received wristbands (guys $20 with \""free\"" drink), we walked over and got through the short line quickly. \n\nThe entrance is enticing: once you pass the whole ticketing charade, you go up a steep escalator toward an ominously dark area. As you walk ahead, you hear the music and the people. We headed straight for the bar to retrieve our \""free\"" drinks, and the bartender obliged. \n\nIt wasn't too crowded for a Saturday night--then again, it was only 10:30. But people were standing around in the upstairs area and dancing around on the downstairs \""dance floor.\"" At one point, there were two gogo dancers who just seemed so awkward. One looked like she didn't feel comfortable at all, while the other looked like she was trying to convince her friend to dance. They would \""dance\"" for a few seconds, and then walk toward each other and talk.\n\nMeanwhile, the music just sucked. I can't even describe it, other than that it wasn't anything that I've heard or anything that people can really dance to. So I opted to sit down, but at last was told to get up because all the tables/ booths are for reservations only. So... No seats at all. Great.\n\nShortly thereafter, my patience grew thin, and I just left. Definitely not a fan.",1

review_399001,entertainment,"Was in Vegas this weekend with just the GF for some quality time.  Started off Saturday morning right where we left off Friday night, her shopping and me scrounging around the stores to find a place to sit and trying to find something interesting to play with on the droid.  After what seemed like days, she was finally done,  We decided to hit the pools.  We figured it best to bypass the wild Tao Beach/Wet Republic/Rehab day pool parties in favor for something more mellow with a bit more class and service.  Plus, guess who wanted to do some more shopping after?  Azure seemed to be the call.  We walked up to the front entrance and were told that all seats were sold out, but we could do a day bed for what I recall was $750.  I told the gentlemen at the door that I don't think we can order $750 of alcohol and food in 2 hours and finish it.  He then said, well, for $20, you can go inside and hang out, women are free.  I paid the $20, and we walked in.  Sure enough, the place was mellow.  There was a smaller jacuzzi style pool on the top level and as you walked further in, there were 2 larger pools inside.  The vibe was mellow, but the music was very good with even a live performer playing the saxophone in sync with the mash up mixes.  Well, sure enough, there was no place to sit.  So, I asked one of the people in charge again if there were any seats left or cancellations.  I saw lots of empty seats that said reserved and things were getting late being around 2:30 PM.  Azure closes at 6 from what I recall.  So, a representative told me $100 for each chair or $200 total for the two of us.  I told them that was too much and declined.  Suddenly, the price dropped to $50 each.  Odd?  Well, we took the bait and enjoyed a few hours of fun.  The quality of food was good albeit pricey.  4 drinks and 3 dishes later, we had hit the $100 dollar requirement.  Tax and tip finished us up for about $140.  We tried all the pools inside, and I must say that the furthest pool in was FREEZING and no one was in it.  The middle pool was about the right temperature, and our small jacuzzi pool was on the warmer side.  I think that Azure is good for those who really dont enjoy large crowds and like a bit of privacy.  I feel sorry for groups of guys I saw hanging out in the cabanas.  Lots of bromance going on there.  In Summary:\n\nPros - Good food and service.  Music was excellent and private VIP environment\n\nCons - Some hustling with the chair prices.  Food and drinks pricey.  Pools need temperature help.  Bromance situation and lack of much eye candy.",1
review_235083,entertainment,"Pappas Park Lanes is one of those places we all grew up with and now is an icon - never to be repeated again.  It's not just an old bowling alley, it's an institution.  We all grew up with places like this as a kid and when we return as adults, it feel comfortable...like returning home briefly until your parents start meddling in your life and tell you to get a real job or join the merchant marines.  \n\nCompared to many other places in town, the prices really aren't that bad.  There's ample parking, room for groups, and the inside is 40+ years old.  Strike City is definitely more modern but you must pass a credit check in order to play a frame or two.  No thanks!\n\nA surprise at Pappas Park Lanes is that the food is pretty good...no, it's really good.  People from work would tell me that some would go there just for the food - which I didn't believe until this week when I enjoyed the barbecue pork sandwich.  I couldn't find any sauce so with just coleslaw, I tackled the large sandwich.  It isn't The Rock Store but I would rank it among the better in that part of town.  \n\nThe burgers are made fresh too...like with hand-formed ground beef instead of a frozen puck that so many restaurants serve.  \n\nWe recently spent an afternoon bowling and really enjoyed the staff, food, and the fun.",4

Going on an off night can be a good bet because you'll be able to get a table but there will still be plenty of people there, just not fire-hazard amount which you can find on the weekends.

The layout of the swap meet  is mind-boggling and it is very easy to get lost.  Several vendors had music blaring way too loudly and/or  were speaking through microphones at an ear splitting level.  It gave me a major headache.  I was surprised that they only had two food vendors and one was the movie theater concession stand,  The prices were horrible and the offerings were frankly pretty lame.  I settled for a crappy hot dog (can't remember the price) and a large soda which cost $3.75 with no refill.  This place could do so much better.

One time we let it spin for 30 minutes. \nSo I called, thinking I'd get a person to buy tickets from and tell that the website wasn't processing orders. No. They have an automated system that wants to know where you live and your phone number and who you think you are trying to buy tickets from them.

Now, with that being said:\n\nLines of sight are absolute shit at Encore Theater. Sound is fine.\n\nI wanted to get that out of the way. (Moving on ...)\n\nThis venue is where Garth Brooks performs (Lorde, is he awful) and where (Spoilers) Jon Secada may be preparing a run at a Las Vegas residency. I have heard them both perform at the Encore Theater and while not particularly seeking obstructed view seating (and my tickets made no mention of it), I happen to be batting 1.000 for suffering through some obstruction in my view for shows here.\n\nIn the balcony section, the lip of said structure (not to mention the cowboy hats) may not allow you to see ole' Garth when he is not singing (which is 80+% of the show) or when he is singing (basically, you see nothing, depending on which row you are in). No mention of this anywhere in the 500$ or so ticket. Warning: Seats may have shit line of sight. Let me be clear: I do not mean parts of the stage. I do not mean the extreme corners of the stage. I mean front and centre, right where Garth sets up to talk his nonsense for an hour. The view of that is obstructed. Great venue (sarcasm). \n\nIn the orchestra section, if one is seated to the extreme sides, the corresponding side of the stage will be missed. Not really unexpected, but for the caliber of theatre this is supposed to be, and the ticket price, one would think that a concert venue inside the building named after a man who reportedly is so involved with everything being built to perfection and exact specifications, would have been designed more thoughtfully. \n\nIn sum -- Encore Theater could have been built better. \""Meh.

With spectacular views and plenty of room to roam, the terrace rooms are your own private get-away in the heart of Vegas. The pool areas and amenities are also great! When I first walked out by one of four pools I felt like I was on a cruise ship in the middle of the Caribbean. Warm weather, pool tables, ping pong, foosball, drinks, hot tubs, and a huge pool with plenty of relaxing seating.  As a person who enjoys the night life but also spending quiet time in my room, this is the perfect place for you.

I'm a dolphin nut, so I rarely pass up the opportunity to see dolphins.  it's kind of nice to see them just swimming around and not doing tricks or anything.  I did wish there was more information about the dolphins to read or listen to or something.  Instead there was, of all things, a snack stand, and a gift shop (of course).\n\nThe biggest pull at the time of our trip is that one of their dolphins has given birth.... and there's a baby dolphin!  I've never seen a baby dolphin so that was awesome... I wish I'd gotten a better photo of it than I did, but it was cute.  \n\nPast the dolphins you enter the original Secret Garden.  They have white lions, which is quite a rare sight, white tigers, regular tigers, some alpacas (wtf why?) and a leopard.  I understand that behind the chain link fences are dangerous animals, but I wish they had some other type of barrier because the chain link fences were nearly impossible to take pictures through, but I tried.\n\nOn the way in to the big cat (and oddly placed alpaca) area, standard Vegas protocol dictates that they have some employees and a \""photographer\"" hustling your party to pose in front of a green screen to take a photo (for sale in the gift shop!).  As a side note, the number of green screen souvenir photo opportunities in Vegas was ASTOUNDING.\n\nAnd as you leave, of course, you have to exit through the gift shop... and the only exit back into the Mirage walks you right past the dolphin gift shop.\n\nOverall, it was worth it for me and my friend.

review_422323,entertainment,"Came here exactly a year ago for my annual trip with my buddies. We liked Baby's and Body English, but this place was lame. We got bottle services and were crammed into an after thought of a booth. The outdoor area was a joke being slightly larger than a townhome back patio. As a frequent guest of the Hard Rock I was quite disappointed in this place. I'll be staying there again this month, but will walk on by Vanity.",1

My regular order is  the pound of wings for $5 and then usually a Three Olive Vodka special. Lots of combos there, and all are tasty.

review_181928,entertainment,WHOAAAAA!!!! I left this show in awe! My goodness!!! What a GREAT production.  The acrobats were astonishing.....the story was very interesting & beautiful....we sat close to the front so we could feel the heat whenever there is fire shooting out.  It was great...well worth the ticket price.  I cannot wait to watch the rest of the Cirque productions in Vegas.  I left super excited because we did not know what to expect since it was our first time watching a Cirque show.  Wow is all I can say. WOW!,4
review_573049,entertainment,"Yes, the showroom is substandard - all seats on one flat level, hard to see, even though the stage is raised.  And yes, some of the dancers were terrific - obviously very talented, well trained, and giving their all.  But the reason you go to an Abba show is to hear all their terrific hits.  Unfortunately, the four singers the night I went were mediocre at best.  As much as I love Abba and all their terrific hit songs, I didn't enjoy this show at all because the quality of the singing was so weak.  There are almost countless options on the Strip.  Don't go to this show.",0

review_642955,entertainment,"Will Automatic Slims break the curse of the revolving door here at the NC Music Factory? Stay tuned.\n\nI went to check out Automatic Slims last night. This spot was formerly Halo.... which was formerly the Garden & Gun Club. Warning: pay attention when you walk down the steps. There's kind of a hidden last one. I saw at least 5 people miss it last night.  \n\nThis place kind of reminds me of an Alley Cat (reminder the old Republic?)... only with way better decor. Retro and rock n roll. It looks great. Super fun stuff. The DJ booth is set inside a trailer looking contraption. Matt Bolick was controlling the tunes last night. I'm a fan of anyone who plays Warrant \""Cherry Pie\"" complete with the video. The back room has pool tables. It looks like a Sailor Jerry ad that has come to life. I dig it.\n\nThe ladies are all done up like 1950's pin-up girls. They look great. I love it. I don't really get why the bartenders are in plaid skirts. Doesn't fit the vibe. I would put them in chaps or cut-off jeans shorts. \n\nI do have to tell this funny encounter. We ordered a round of shots. We asked for Sailor Jerry, pineapple and Red Bull. Bartender said okay... do you want them separate or mixed? Giggle. \n\nUnlike its predecessors, I think this place will benefit a lot from the Fillmore. It's the right vibe for pre and post concert drinks. Best of luck to Automatic Slims. I'll definitely pop in for a drink(s) whenever I'm Music Factory-ing it up.",2
review_119979,entertainment,"There some basic criteria I use when rating an airport: 1. Is it worse than Laguardia? 2. Is it clean? 3. Is it easy to navigate? 4. How are the food/retail options? 5. Do the employees make things pleasant or stressful? Vegas airport passes all these test except for one, being easy to navigate.\n\nI wandered around like a tourist in time square while trying to find baggage claim. It was horrible... I eventually found out that you have to take an airtran to baggage claim, which makes no sense in my opinion. Upon arriving at baggage claim, it was another 10 minutes to find out which of the many carousels was for my flight. Not fun. I should preface this by saying that I NEVER usually check my bag, but was forced to because I was one of the last people on a full flight...\n\nOther than that debacle, the airport is pretty awesome. Lots of great shops, good restaurants, efficient security line and a brand new look and feel. If it weren't a maze, it would be very close to perfect.",2

review_130081,entertainment,"Cheap Hotel and Casino. But There's nothing special about this place. I like how they have an amusement park in the hotel and an medium-size midway (games) for the kids. But definitely one of the lower- rated hotels in Vegas. \n\nThe rooms were good. They were clean and maids clean the rooms pretty well everyday and they change our towels when needed. One thing I didn't like was that the walls were pretty thin. I could hear the neighbor's conversation. \n\nAlso, I wished these rooms had more security or at least the rules are enforced better. We requested non-smoking, so the receptionist put us on the non-smoking floors. But our neighbors were smokers! and we could smell the smoke seeping through our doors. We called the front desk to complain and they told us that they were send security up right away. But nothing happened... we still smelled smoke and no matter how many times we complaint, we never heard or saw security take care of the matter. \n\nAlso another thing that I disliked was how anal and rude most of the workers are. I thought that the staff at the midway were suppose to be kid-friendly, but no they scare away the kids. They barely speak to you and they give you this stare that makes you want to give them a 10-foot radius. \n\nOverall: It's cheap, but i think that you can stay at the better hotel for about the same prices if you look online for deals.",1
review_508519,entertainment,Insert Coins is definitely a fun place and a cool idea.  I wish it was less club-like and kept their drink prices a little lower.  I understand that going out is a different experience for most people than it is for me.  This place is more about being seen with the cool kids than what I would call an authentic good time.  So if you're into it you can have a couple $10 drinks and be like the kids on TV.,3

review_180311,entertainment,"More like 2 and a half stars but I rounded up.  I've only been here once but in my opinion, one time is enough.  So if you don't want to take my opinion then stop reading.  \n\nTao is located inside the Venetian which is a gorgeous hotel.  I stayed at the Palazzo once, which is adjacent to the Venetian and absolutely loved it.  Tao does not live up to the Venetian name.  It is pretty, don't get me wrong, lots of things to look at and a nice cool smoking balcony area, for those of you that smoke.  I don't, by the way.  You enter in through the restaurant then go up the stairs to the club itself, so it is somewhat awkward because you see patrons trying to enjoy their dinner while hordes of girls and guys are walking in ready to party.  \n\nTao is small, so therefore it gets insanely crowded.  If you do not have bottle service you are stuck in the crowd, and trust me it gets very packed, to the point where it is hard to move.  If you have bottle service, you are a lot more comfortable but here comes the question, if bottle service is worth it?  There's an upstairs portion with tables that only people with table service are allowed to go up to.  It is considerably less crowded than the dance floor.\n\nThe good things about Tao is that there's open bar for ladies before a certain time and that's why I rounded up my stars. \n\nSide story: I got accused by the bartender, who was a girl, of passing on drinks to other people, because I wanted to get another drink after she made me one like 5 minutes or so beforehand.  I finished the drink so fast because it was pretty much juice with a splash of liquor but whatever, it was free so I'm venting, not complaining.\n\nThe off thing about Tao is their upstairs bathroom.  Whoever designed them really had no clue about drunk people.  So it's a clear glass door that gets frosted when you lock it.  So clearly if you're drunk you might forget to lock the door, which is what happened to a friend of mine.  Luckily we saw that she didn't lock it and stood in front of the door hiding her.  No free shows tonight!",2
review_136646,entertainment,"Our host for the weekend recommended this club for our bachelorette party.  \n\nFirst, we had to wait about an hour for the male review show to start.  They had us waiting in the gentlemen's area, so we got a chance to see the girls work it.  It was interesting.  Got to chat with some of the girls, they seem really nice.  I only saw a couple that had really nice bodies and were really pretty.\n\nFinally our show was about to start.  We got in there, and we were 1 of 3 bachelorette parties there.  The room felt really empty!  We left the show after our girl got her strip dance.  It wasn't anything to write home about.  There were 1-2 hot guys.  Most of it was just annoying that they kept coming to ask us if we wanted a lap dance.  When we said no, they laughed at us and said we were a bunch of lesbians.  Whatever!",1
review_541689,entertainment,"As a lifelong car buff, I was looking to fulfill a dream by driving an exotic on a track. Prior to this, the most exotic car I ever drove was a brief spin in my friend's dad's AMG SL63, an amazing car, but couldn't do much driving on the street. With the limits removed on the track I was admittedly nervous. The toughest choice was between the F430 and the Gallardo, however, I chose the F430 as I felt RWD would make for a better track experience than the AWD Lambo.\n\nThe day started out great. We were warmly greeted at the gate. Registration was easy and the instruction was thorough and brief. I waited my turn and upon finding out that the Green Gallardo was a RWD model I thought of changing my mind, but then looked down at the Ferrari logo on my shirt(which I purchased at the museum in Maranello) and stuck with the Ferrari. \n\nNow on to why I chose 3-stars for this review. \n\nWhen the driver returned from the previous ride, he got out and I was in. After taking a couple of brief photos and barely having time to adjust the seat, we were off. The ride itself was fun, however, the guy in the yellow Lambo in front of me was going way too slow! It wasn't until the ride was over when I told the instructor that I ride a 600cc supersport bike that I found out that I could've started ahead of the guy in the Lambo, instead the experience was nearly ruined. The instructor was great at explaining the track during the ride, however, I wish he would've asked me prior to take off what I drive and what my level of experience/comfort is. To top it off, as quick as I got in, I was out. I was hoping for the experience to include spending a little more time with the car to get a feel for the interior, check out the engine and controls, etc. \n\nAlso, just a side note, as these cars are part of the Global Exotic rental fleet for liability reasons we were required to drive the F1 transmission in auto mode and drive with the top up. Despite the auto mode, the shifts were still very quick and it did not take away from the experience. Having the top-down would've been cool as well as I've owned 2 convertibles(a Firebird and Mustang, neither of which were anything close to as nice as this F430), however, this too did not take away from the experience.\n\nOverall the experience was good, but there's still room for improvement. I hope for next time that they can spend just a few minutes surveying us on our level of experience/comfort prior to taking off and to give us a couple of minutes to really soak in the \""OMG, I'm in a Ferrari\"" feeling.",2

review_30441,entertainment,"Love South Mountain Park. It is such a great place to get some exercise and enjoy AZ! I take my dog for a trail run about every other week and always seem to find a new trail to explore (that may be because the trails aren't marked very well, but I can always find my way back to the car). I have to say the maps at the trail heads are a bit washed out, so before the \""smart phone\"" I had a difficult time determining how far I had actually hiked. Now that I have the cardio trainer on my Droid I can see I was padding my workouts juuuuust a bit... :) \n\nTrails can vary from easy to intense, depending on how hard you push yourself. You can get a great workout or enjoy a nice stroll, makes it a great place to take out-of-towners. \n\nParking is good in the summer (of course) and decent in the spring and fall. Expect to walk a bit to the trail head, especially in the winter - but that is what you are there for! The only day I CONSISTENTLY have trouble parking is Superbowl Sunday... is Camelback Mountain closed on that day? :)",4

Since my best friends and I will be in Vegas at the end of Aug, I figured I'd contact this company to see about VIP entry.

I figured it'd be nice to be walked in a club or two we were interested in going to without waiting in line.\n\nI filled out my info on the site to get a call back on VIP Entry. The next day I received a email from Greg asking me to answer about 5 questions to see what we were looking for etc. At the end of the email it also said that I could call or text to schedule a time to speak. Because it was a busy day at  work&I couldn't get away from my desk, I filled out the questions and texted Greg and asked him when a good time to talk would be. \n\nThis was 5 days ago...with no word from him or anybody else at the company. I guess what Elizabeth D. said was right! They don't want to be bothered with us common folk, who don't want to spend THOUSANDS on bottle service. LOL!

review_422252,entertainment,"This is my second Rock n Roll Half Marathon and all I could say afterwards was Seattle is way better! And no this is not just my hometown bias....I mean Seattle had hills and I still preferred that over the flat Vegas course!\n\nThe good:\n1. Easy access to health and fitness expo prior with no parking fee.\n2. Running at night with all the lights from the main Strip.\n3. Weather was nice (not windy, not cold).\n\nThe bad (this list is long):\n1. Running bag with little to no goodies/coupons.\n2. More expensive registration fee than a lot of other cities.\n3. Difficult to find parking near the start line, thus needing to walk 1-2 miles to just get to the start.\n4. Rubbing elbows with people for the first mile of the run due to the amount of people per corral.\n5. Poorly lit or unlit roads near Fremont street...first off it's ghetto there and second  off now I'm going to trip and potentially get injured =(\n6. Post-race snacks after the finish line were lame!  They didn't have bottles of water right after the finish line...you had to walk quite a ways before finding a bottle.  And in terms of the snacks, I mean at least throw in some bananas.  At the Seattle one there was a plethora of snacks and even jamba juice.  They had beer....but honestly I'd prefer a banana over a beer after a long run.\n7.  The medals were not consistent.  I ended up with a nice one, but my brothers ended up with some jacked up looking medals with faded print and colors.  However, they did say they would replace the medal after my brother took a picture of his and sent in an email.\n\nI know the amount of people at the Vegas run is 30k plus, a lot more than other cities.  However, the novelty of the Strip lights wore off pretty quickly.  I think it's a more difficult run since there's little visual stimulation on a straight course at night time.  Only positive for me is that I shaved off 10 minutes from my last PR =)",1

We were very impressed by the decorations, but thought overall it was a bit small and boring. We asked two of the gorgous playboy bunnies to take a picture with us. They looked at us up and down, and then proceded to talk to eachother. Shocked I asked one of them if they would take the picture of us with the other girl. They agreed, but the bunny didn't even smile in the picture, and the one who was taking it didnt aim the shot, so the bday girl was cut out of the picture. They handed the camera back, and the one girl joked to the other \""you didnt even smile\""!!! We couldnt believe how rude the girls were. We imediatly left the club, blasting to everyone we passed not to go in. I will never set foot in the playboy club again, or let anyone I know go near it.

review_319693,entertainment,"I just adore the Strip District, especially on a beautiful day.  You can spend the whole day just browsing the quirky stores and sampling street foods.  The more this place changes the more it stays the same.  Depending on the day and time of day the Strip morphs into different things.  Family friendly during the day with awesome ethnic food and proprietors, eclectic shopping and amusing sidewalk entertainment.  As dinnertime approaches some of the stores close and other food venues open. Into the night, add a few bars and nightclubs.  My favorite time to go is on a weekday, (Less crowded & cheaper parking)  either get there at 10am or get there after lunch at 1pm.  Since I do not live in the city I always try to get out of the Strip by 4pm to avoid the traffic on my trek eastward.  In saying that, weekends here offer a more amped up and exciting visit.\nThere is never a dull day in the Strip, always something to look at, try, buy or just sit streetside and people watch with a cocktail.

See all my reviews here on Yelp.  (link: http://www.yelp.com/list/my-favorite-cirques-las-vegas)\n\nFor me, this show was lacking... well, CIRQUE.

(On a positive note, the singers are really good.  To which, this review would have only gotten one star without them.)\n\nNonetheless, if you paid and did not get a REFUND due to the pyrotechnics malfunctioning, the breakdown would follow:\n\n - $10 for the tribute video, one would pay at an Elvis museum\n - $40 for a good Vegas lounge act with no headliner\n - $40 for a Cirque-lite side show\n\nThat's a total of $90 for 90 minutes with no intermission, which leaves you in the nose-bleeds section of this show.

review_166188,entertainment,"I was pleasantly surprised with my most recent stay at Treasure Island. I was under the impression that TI was an old fashioned hotel with old school rooms. I was extremely wrong. The rooms were rather large with modern decor. 100x better than when I stayed at the Luxor. Room service is pretty quick...30-40 minutes as opposed to a normal hour wait for food delivery service. The pool was nice and the bartenders friendly. The DJ spins the music super loudly so dont bother bringing your iPod (I could barely hear it when I tried).\n\nAll in all, this place is A-OK and I would definitely not mind staying there again.",2

The food is rubbish (their spin on Tex/Mex or Mexican) and the noise will make sure that all audible communication between you and your friends will stop completely.   I don't get what genre their appealing to either and what is all that weird signage crap on the walls?   Another review said this is like spring break in Mexico?  I didn't get that impression - more like another Vegas attempt to be hip...,1
review_601819,entertainment,"I'll start off by saying I've never really been a huge fan of these types of clubs. You know the ones where they judge you on if you have female genitalia, how much professional work you've had done on your ankles or if you have had your brows waxed in the last five minutes. I went with four girlfriends so they let me in right away. I mean I was the only guy and I was \""bringing\"" four girls in. (Disclosure: they actually brought me in). The bouncer tells me he likes how I roll. I look to the right and there is a line of desperate guys just waiting to get in. I smile at them and just walk in. Decor is awesome. There is a pool for the outside and a kick-ass club  inside. The DJ was pretty good and people seem to be having a good time. I'm the kind of guy that would rather go to a dive bar though. You meet the most awesome people, drinks aren't $10 a piece and it's trashy. I love trashy. This place was great for Scottsdale/Phoenix Metro Area. If you miss your LA/Vegas clubs, this is the spot to go! I just don't like to be judged because I usually do the judging. Just kidding!",2

A beautiful greeter handed us both a mini bottle of Chandon champagne that was chilled and lovely. Our seats were perfectly positioned  half way back in the middle and at a cute antique table and chair set no less!  I don't want to spoil the show for anyone with plot etc. but it was so fun and entertaining.  Again as you have heard from any review of Absinth, if you have sensitive ears towards foul language or sexually explicit material run don't walk from this show!   I loved the entire experience and would go back again and again and again!  Oh and Serendipity is right in front of the venue so grab a delicious dessert after the show!",4

If you are going with a group who love hanging out by the water or love swimming, this is the place for you.... It's fantastic... This is the first place that I would pick to stay in Vegas... The casino is huge... watch out  and pay attention on where you go cause it's easy to get lost in here, did I mention that everywhere in the casino look the same? :)",3
review_208454,entertainment,"Saw Def Leppard here- this show was one of the best shows I have ever been to! The venue is amazing- The Joint is small enough to allow everyone- even the people in the very back- to see the entire stage up close! Glad I stood in the back- the floor seating was pretty tight, and there is plenty of leaning room in the back, where you can still see the whole stage and the 3 screens showing great shots of all the guys. Def Leppard still rocks after all these years, and they have never sounded better. They play a new setlist every night before they reach intermission, after which they play the entire Hysteria album. Definitely a once in a lifetime event!! Had an amazing time, wish I could have gone to more than one night!",4
review_273510,entertainment,"Make no bones about it, this is the eye of the storm when it comes to party hotels in Scottsdale... Indigo is surrounded by no less than 38 relatively high-profile bars, restaurants, and nightclubs within stumbling distance which has it's plusses and minuses... Let's start with the plusses: The entire staff is incredibly friendly. You won't find any sarchasm here. The heated pool is excellent. The communal lobby/bar is excellent, especially if you know about the hidden door. The isolated work out room is amazing, and hardley ever used. The shuttle service is beyond par.\nThe minuses: On busy weekend nights, the entire building is surrounded by a maelstrom of activity until right around 3:00am... I spied security guards from some of the surrounding nightclubs smoking crack in the alcoves, and the noise level, while ignoreable is constant. The hallways, especially in the morning are very active, and the doors seem like they were designed to slam very loudly. The food in the restaurant is bearable, but is nothing special. The patrons all seem to expect this, and with the website name, how could you not understand the concept? The rooms are for the most part quite clean, although the grout in the bathrooms needs more maintenance. The shower in the \""disabled\"" room that I saw had a bathtub with rails instead of a walk-in shower, which seemed backwards from most other \""disabled\"" rooms I've ever had the pleasure to stay in.\nIf you're a hipster, this place is totally for you. if you're not, go stay at the Hilton down the street... Although I've stayed there, and was really annoyed there to the nth's degree in comparrison...",3
review_365464,entertainment,"Beautifully decorated, impressive pool outside, and clean bathrooms. My friends and I weren't really vibing with the music though and the club was waaaaaaay too packed. They must've been over capacity because we were honestly packed in like sardines in a can.",2
review_504242,entertainment,"Cons: I like hip-hop but what they played when I went on a Saturday night recently was basically the hip-hop that I don't really like- like the 'Bubble Butt' song and 'wiggle wiggle' song. It was seriously bad hip-hop and rap like that for most of the night. The drinks were $12 each, but were watered down, and I do not drink with any regularity so I was surprised when after two drinks I was still not feeling tipsy. Cover was $20 for girls. The floor was sticky, wet, and dirty and since they kept showering confetti on the floor, there was a combination of spilled drinks, dirt, napkins and confetti on the floor that led to your shoes sticking to the floor, tissue paper and napkins sticking to your shoes, and if your dress or pants were long, the hem of your clothing ending up totally disgusting by the end of the night. \n\nPros: cover charge was only $20 as compared to $50 for girls at Hakkasan nightclub, which was our other option; it was cool to be on the rooftop and under the Eiffel Tower replica, the lighting and decor were nice, and we did not have to wait in line to get in. The only staff we interacted with were nice enough. Overall I had a decent time.",2

review_72835,entertainment,On my way to Vegas there where bulletin boards advertising free hot wings and $100 free slot play with membership of their club. So I was like why not. I haven't been and I heard it was a nice casino and hotel. The casino was nice with hardwood floors like their restaurants and a nice change from the usual tacky carpet print. But the casino is small. And the hot wings are not free. It's only free after 12am-6am. Talk about false advertisement. I played for free and left because if I was gonna eat hot wings from hooters and pay for them I might as well eat them at home.,1
review_160444,entertainment,"Not worth the price!  The casino reeks of smoke!  You have to walk through it to get most places and you walk right through lots of smoke!  Very noisy!

review_214522,entertainment,"As a child of the 80s, I just was expecting more from the magician we grew up watching on TV through the years. Instead, the theater was so small, I felt like I was about to watch a local spoken word talent.  David Copperfield was so arrogant, it was sad to watch. Everytime he finished a trick, you could hear crickets in the audience and he had to clap his hands together and yell out to us \""ok clap now!! yay!! clap!!\"" Sure there were a few of us that were a little slow to catch on to some of what he was doing (ie, being told to hit a beach ball towards the back of the room yet some people still couldn't resist to hit the ball towards the front). David was sure to pick the young skinny girls from the audience who didn't speak much English and then made fun of them on stage because they couldn't respond to his questions fast enough. He played a video of him escaping from a pit of fire while suspended in the air but the video quality was so bad, I could swear it was an act he did 20 years ago. I know he meant for us to all be impressed after we saw the video but honestly, we're they're to see him perform live, not videos of him that we could youtube from home. His showmanship was really lacking. He really didn't put the effort in to wow us at all. It was like he knew he already had our money so he was just going through the motions and doing the tricks, reciting the scripts and reading the cue cards. There was 1 awesome trick that really astounded us though the middle of this act. When he made the old school car appear out of thin air, our jaws dropped. I think because this was in the middle of his act, we all thought \""oh good, it's getting better now.\"" but then it just fell off from there. My advice: save the car act for the end of the show because everything else seems so dull compared to it.",1
review_194093,entertainment,"Le Reve is definitely an appropriate title for this show. Set in the Wynn, it's a bit out of the way of the central part of the Vegas strip, but it's worth the walk over. \n\nMy friend and I were lucky enough to score front row seats (splash zone) to the show right by the main stage entrance/exit. Warning: You will get wet, but who doesn't want to be splashed by muscular men wearing tight pants? Exactly. Anyways, they story line to this show is amazing and just so heartwarming... it gives you that funny feeling inside. \n\nThere are tons of aerial acts in this show as well as synchronized swimming portions (since this is a water show). Lights, sounds, and actors just make the whole setting real. It's pretty fun sitting in the very front since many of the actors come by and become very interactive with the audience.\n\nAll in all, it's a great show! If you're looking for a more intimate Cirque venue on the strip, this is probably the show for you.",4
review_504247,entertainment,"We purchased tickets for the New Years party. $100 ea. we arrived at 9:30 and stood in a short line which we thought was to get us into the club. Once we got to the front of the line we were told we needed to stand in another line to get our wrist band. The line extended well past all the strip entrances and into the heart of the casino. We found the end of the line and waited for about 20 minutes. After a quick calculation of how far we had moved to the length of the line we realized that we probably werent hound to make into the club by midnight and if we did would have packed standing room only and no drinks. We walked back up to the front of the line to try and find someone that could assure us we would make it in the that the event hadn't been over sold. There was one poor sole trying to check ids and put wristbands on the people in our line, we left. I won't come back and it really bothers me that I feel like I was scammed out of my $200.

THEY WILL TRY TO SAY \""YOUR NOT GOING TO GET IN B4 11, SO JUST PAY ME $30 TO CUT THE LINE\"".  DON'T DO IT!  Just wait.  We were at the front rope and they still tried to run that game on us.

We did not pay and we were one of the first people inside.\n\nInside the place is REALLY nice.  Drinks were expensive, but I guess that's just Vegas.  DJ had skills but he mixed in rock and other genres with the hip-hop.  BOO!!!!!!  Crowd seemed very phony and fake and just stayed to themselves.

Only good thing about this place was the DJ's skills (not his music) and the bathroom attendant who said \""Enjoy your piss\"".\n\nMoral of the story, if you really want to come here, then get free passes on the street, get there by 10-ish, go straight to the front and DO NOT pay the bouncers to be let in.",0

review_377736,entertainment,"In a place where money is everything, there are few things left in sin city that are actually free, without consequence. Free casino cocktails are courtesy of losing wages, complimentary rooms are through earned player points, and the pirate show at Treasure Island ... ought to pay it's spectators for being the cheesiest reoccurring show on the strip. The Fountains of the Bellagio on the other hand, are about as good as free gets.\n\nFor those not in the know, these fountains provide a water show of synchronized streams of water pulsating to a random song two times an hour and four times an hour after 8PM. The best time to watch is at night as the light beams emanating from each stream provide a real spectacle not to be missed.\n\nThese fountains don't discriminate. Everyone is allowed to watch. Crowds aren't really regulated and each show features different songs. Each are unique, fun, and beautiful. It has become synonymous with the Bellagio and dare I say more popular than some of the live Broadway-like shows up and down LV Boulevard.\n\nThere are shows all around the world that do something similar, be it in a mall or even at the Burj Khalifa in Dubai. But few have a place in my heart like the Fountains of the Bellagio, easily the best outdoor show on the strip.",4
review_611888,entertainment,"Before I continue, I would like to say that this review is regarding only the arcade portion of this GameWorks. After hearing everyone's excitement about the new GameWorks opening up and seeing the sign posted inside of TownSquare for over a year, I thought this place was going to be spectacular. I was definitely let down. \n\nFirst of all, the space for the games is just too small. You could run through them all in just a couple of hours. That is, if you get a chance to play them at all. It's always crowded with so many people and sometimes you'll find parents just taking up the chairs for the games to watch their children play.\n\nSecond, not only are the cards/points extremely overpriced for an arcade but, the self help kiosks don't even work and when we went to inform the employees at the ticket counter, they just shrugged and said \""They never work\"".\n\nThis brings me to another point, a lot of the games are ALREADY broken! Why pay so much money for all of these points if everything is shut down? Ridiculous.\n\nLastly, if your children play enough games to earn enough points for a certain prize that they want, don't let them get too excited. A couple of my friends spent just enough money to win enough tickets to get the LEGO pillow that they've been eyeing for a while. As soon as they reached the 1,500 ticket mark, they went to redeem their prize. Then, the employees told them they don't even have the LEGO pillows in stock. Though a few different colors of them were hanging on the walls.\n\nI wish they could just open up a reasonably priced arcade. From now on, I'm sticking to the Pinball Hall of Fame.",0
review_597128,entertainment,"Jeesh.... I had really high hopes for Hakkasan Nightclub before it opened. PR was great. DJ lineup's were great. Plus MGM is the hotel I stay at every time I go to Las Vegas so I was very excited.\n \nAnywho... first time I went to Hakkasan was a Friday night. I arrived really late but I still wanted to go clubbing. So might as well check out Hakkasan. It was around 2:00AM... and I was thinking entrance fee might be cut. But once I got in line... they said the entrance was $80.... wtf WHY IS IT $80 at 2AM when everyone's already inside and basically wrapping up the night?! Ugh... seriously? Welll I had no choice and paid that damn expensive ass entrance (Mind you it was 5 girls, 2 guys uh.. okay should have been like $30) . Walked inside and NO ONE was dancing. The music was okay... but the crowd was HORRIBLE. No one looked like they were having fun. No one drunk. No one trying to just have a good time. Damn.. wtf did Hakkasan put in your drinks? No matter how shitty the club, at least a few people are having fun. I found myself going back and forth between the hip hop stage and main stage, trying to catch some good music and good vibes. It was so horrible I couldn't take it anymore, left around 3:30AM. What a waste. $80 for 1.5 hours. Damn, I got jacked.\n\nSECOND time... I wasn't even planning to go. It was my baby cousin's 21st birthday. So we got all our family to come to Vegas and party together. Had a room at MGM, but still didn't even plan on going to Hakkasan. We reserved a table at the LIGHT at Mandalay... but when I was walking to my room on Saturday, a promoter from Hakkasan stopped me and tried to sell me a table. Eventually, I agreed because he said he would give us a table for $1000. So we made an agreement, got each other numbers, confirmed, etc etc etc etc bullshit etc. So I went back up to my room, informed my family, and we all got ready and went downstairs. The MINUTE I get to the table line (mind you, I was still texting the promoter WHILE GETTING READY AND GOING DOWNSTAIRS), he texts me \""bumped all tables to $2500, better go to LIGHT\"" What the FUCK?! This story might sound a bit familiar because Anthony P. jotted down my story in his review. He was with me and my family... GOOD JOB HAKKASAN. YOU JUST PISSED OFF TWO DIE-HARD YELPERS.  God.. boy did I loook stupid in front of my family. In the end, we went to LIGHT at Mandalay Bay... thank god my promoter TOMMY pulled through at LIGHT and got us a table for the ORIGINAL price he offered. Thanks TOMMY you were great..... but screw you Hakkasan. You SERIOUSLY came close to RUINING my baby cousin's 21st birthday. 21st birthday... Las Vegas... COME ON. get your shit together.",0

review_205461,entertainment,Considering the cover charge I expected more from this club...way more. It's comprised of only 2 small rooms with a narrow balcony walkway connecting them together. The bar was shoddy at best and looked like it was just thrown together by some amateur/aspiring bartender. It was definitely something you'd see at a frat party. Most people's liquor collection at home is better than this. The crowd was mainly comprised of older men in their late 30's/early 40's. The older men were constantly eyeballing the younger women. I guess that's a good thing if you're a girl who idolizes Anna Nicole and plan to go after some old dude's pension. Save your money and go to Rum Jungle instead.,0
review_183488,entertainment,"I really wanted to like this place because it was close to our hotel and me and the crew got hooked up for free.  It was a Saturday night, we bypass the line and go directly to the bouncer who completely hooks it up and ushers us right in - free of charge.  Once we got inside it was a completely different story.  It's Vegas so I completely expected the normal wasted drunk Vegas crowd, but what I got was a bunch of slobs so drunk they could barely stand.  Upon entry a guy was sitting in the hallway with his head between his legs looking like he was on the verge of heaving that awesome buffet he spent $30 on.  Next in the main room, the place is a great size, but the dance floor next to the DJ was completely overpacked. \n\nEveryone knows that the people don't make a club, the music makes a club, so immediately I was excited when I heard that DJ Skribble, was gonna be spinning around midnight.   The music up until midnight was a mix of Top 40 fused with Electro/House (which is all good), but the DJ seemed to have a trigger finger and only played about 20 seconds of the song...(HATE THAT!).  Then DJ Skribble was up, it's now 12:30...what a complete let down!  The music was just bleh...and it didn't help that the club was swamped with wasted sloppy people, flailing their limbs and singing along (I'm sure they had a great time!)  Needless to say, I stepped in glass twice and decided after the second 60+ year old creep didn't take NO as an answer, it was time to leave by 1am.  \n\nProbably won't be checking this place out again, but if you have nothing better to do and you are staying at the MGM...this might be a place you could stop by.",1

There were three or four lines wrapping around the entire \""square\"" with no clear signs for VIP or Guest list lines. When I asked an employee which line I should get to, the way he answered made it seem like someone had pissed in his corn flakes or something. Attitude much? (See number 5 down below)\n\n2. Layout. Stairs=Not cool. Also, the bathrooms on the ground level: who the hell puts \""yin\"" and \""yang\"" on the doors instead of women/men (And no clear symbols either) While waiting for my friend outside, I redirected several guys who nearly walked into the female restrooms. \n\n3. Crappy music. Benny Benassi was headlining at TAO but didn't show up until around 1 or so. But before that in the different rooms had some shitty remixes.\n\n4. The crowd. I don't know if maybe I went on an \""off\"" day or anything but nobody was dancing! What's up with that? Benny Benassi was supposed to be there but it didn't seem like the crowd was hyped up or excited as all. Everyone just seemed like they were standing around \""being cool\"". It almost felt like a middle school dance. Awkward!\n\n5. Service/Employees. After my friend and I decided to leave, I discovered that my id (thankfully just my college one) and hotel room key had somehow fallen out of my wallet. I went back to ask for help but the promoter I talked to was so unsympathetic and rude to me that it made me cry. Virtually every employee I asked questions to in TAO was either rude or not helpful at all (except for the elevator guy, who was just helping out at TAO and regularly works at LAVO). \n\nEven though my friend and I paid no cover and had the open bar wristbands, it was by far the worst club we went to in our Vegas trip.

review_182686,entertainment,"Visit number two to the OG fine dining restaurant in Las Vegas.\n\nIt's been here for a while, and actually is a great deal in comparison to the restaurants out there. Am I ever lucky enough at the roulette or craps tables to shell out $350 at Joel Robuchon? Not really. So Picasso it is.\n\nIt is a restaurant in a museum. It's strange dining with Picasso paintings. It's not overbearing though, and doesn't really hit you until you take a picture in front of one and review it later. And the food is great too.\n\nOrdered the 5 course degustation menu.\n\nAmuse Bouche: \nChilled white asparagus soup with almond and chive garnish; Smoked salmon with caviar.\nLoved both dishes. \n\nFirst Course:\nKing crab salad with apple vinaigrette.\nQuite tasty. Light and elegant. The sweetness of the crab came through well.\n\nSecond Course:\nU-10 Day boat scallop with potato puree.\nSurprisingly heavy. Last time, I had this dish was amazingly light and fluffy. This coin-sized scallop ate almost like a steak. Though, it was still quite good. I remembered it as the best scallop ever, but I guess I'll have to revise my thoughts on this one.\n\nThird Course: \nFoie gras with Peach garnish, with Muscat reduction.\nI loved this dish the first time I was there, I loved it again. Hands down, they can make the best one. Somehow. Coupled with a Royal Tokaji dessert wine from Hungary made this so brilliant.\n\nMain Course:\nRoasted lamb loin with vegetable ragout.\nHonestly, this was a miss. I wished I had ordered the turbot. I believe the strength of Serrano's dishes are in seafood. I missed the boudin that I had last time. I missed the lobster salad. Oh well, maybe next time.\n\nDessert:\nTorte with cherry mousse and cherry sorbet.\nTasty. Black forest cake, taken to the nth level. \n\nStill 5 stars though. For the food price relative to the market, it's still one of the best deals for fine dining in Vegas. View is unbeatable, seeing both the Bellagio fountains every half hour, and dining with Picasso paintings.\n\nOut of the 4 trips a year I make to Vegas, I'll probably be back, about once a year.",4
review_389544,entertainment,"I went here for a Birthday party and I was not really impressed. They have an arcade for the kids in the main entrance.  That can be good and bad. I went up to the bar and I started to gamble and I literally had to wait 10 minutes to get offered a drink. Bartenders were too busy talking to other employees or using their phones. The party was upstairs in the balcony area. In my opinion, drunk people and steep ass stairs do not mix well together. The idea is nice but I am not sure about trekking down those stairs after a couple of beers. As for service; I was not really satisfied. Maybe it was because the waitress never came back to take our food order. Maybe it was for the best because when I looked at the menu it was waaay overpriced for what seems to be your typical bar food flair. Two and a half stars - rounded down to two.",1
review_184899,entertainment,"I had a lot of fun here, but I would never pay a $30+ cover. Especially when the drinks inside are so expensive as well. Very pretty though! Fairly good music. Fairly spacious, lots of room for dancing, at least. The awkwardly standing off to the side space is kind of lacking. . .\n\nI got around the cover by texting a promoter who kept liking my photos on Instagram. Hashtag that shit and see what you can get for free. I got my friend and I on the guest list here, a free drink, and stamps to XS, which is also in the Wynn I think. Details are fuzzy, excuse me. The cover for XS is $50+ and that's just ridiculous. I'm basically only writing this review to give everyone the Instagram heads-up. Again, hashtag that shit and see what happens.

review_300331,entertainment,"This was the first club I've been to in Vegas, so I have nothing to compare it to. A guy gave us bracelets on the street so we thought we try it out thinking it would be free. We waited in line about 20 minutes at 10:30pm on a Saturday night. We get up there to discover that we had to pay $10 instead of $20. I guess this is common for all of the clubs. So we paid the $10. \n\nWe ordered $10 mixed drinks that were extremely watered down. I wanted to drink water in between drinks and asked for a glass at the bar. This has never been a problem at any club/bar I've ever been too, but the guy insisted I pay $6 for a tiny water bottle. Ok I get it, those are your rules. It doesn't mean I have to like them.  \n\nWe quickly discover that we cannot sit anywhere in the club. I guess this is also common knowledge at Vegas clubs, but since we didn't know it was a big shock to be told you have to pay a small fortune to sit at a table. We did find a ledge to sit on so that was better than nothing. \n\nThis club redeemed itself by playing awesome music. At that point I didn't care about everything I just complained about above. The club was packed and the dance floor got crowded, but it wasn't so bad because we had some personal space dancing. They played a lot of old school songs (like from Jock Jams awhile back) and newer remixed songs. \n\nI probably wouldn't come back here, but at least I have an idea of what to expect at other Vegas clubs.",1

Local ladies are free to get in, my husband had to pay $10. \nThe atmosphere inside is kind of tropical, and dress code was business/party casual. The dance floor got crowded pretty quick. \nThe music was very rhythmic and I couldn't stand still and danced the whole night. The crowed was mixed. Tequila shots are $8 each for a small shot, ugh how I hate the expensive drinks in Las Vegas. Anyway, it was nice to try out this place and we had a good time. Will I be back? Maybe.",2
review_292817,entertainment,"I have always been a fan of the Wynn..... and hated that the Palazzo was so great.  Lol, it is a wonderful hotel.  I stayed here awhile back and had the best time.\n\nThe Room:  The room was Las Vegas Luxury in all its grandeur.  It was very room and stylishly decorated.  The bed was wonderfully comfortable and hard to get out of.  It is a dangerous trap, sleep on the floor otherwise you will never leave the room.  The sunken living room was a nice touch. This is where they have the Wynn beat.  I didn't want to like it, but I was forced.  We had a view of the shared pool with the Venetian.\n\nGrand Lux: Yum! Just what you need after a long night of drinking.  They had a buffalo chicken wrap that was very appetizing.  It was like The Cheesecake Factory, I Believe its owned by the same company.\n\nConcierge:  loved them.  I stayed at MGM before and their concierge had NO hookups.  Not here.  This guy got us in Tao VIP, great restaurant reservations and any show we wanted to see.  \n\nPool: it was hot as hell, I was melting like the wicked witch. But the waitress was wonderful..... never had a problem ordering another drink.\n\nGreat hotel, nice place to add to your Vegas hotel tour.",4

It's basically a huge cube that looks the same in every dimension... It's completely unorganized, even for VIP.. this place doesn't make any sense to me..\n\nTo me it's a wannabe version of some of the major clubs out in Vegas and it just doesn't compare... \n\nYou can't even tell where the line is, it's that ridiculous... Once you get inside, the isles near the bars are so darn narrow and the dance floor is nothing special either.. \n\nIf you're looking for a kick ass club in Vegas, go big and spend the same amount at Tao or Tryst.  Leave Jet behind... It's garbage...",1
review_231487,entertainment,"Love this park! There are so many different areas to explore.\n\nI absolutely love the running/walking trails. My favorite is the 1.5 mile loop trail around the desert dunes. They really did a nice job with informative signs and info about the dunes. My only complaint is that there is only one area on the trail that has shade. Very well maintained.\n\nA large portion of the park is undergoing renovations. so a lot of the park areas are roped off. Hopefully they will be done soon.\n\nThis park has something for everyone. Fishing, disc golf, basketball, volleyball, tennis, playgrounds, and numerous picnic tables and pavilions. This place also has the largest dog park in Las Vegas. This place is also not overrun by the homeless and has a police station on premises. \n\nA great place to bring the family and enjoy a nice day in the park!",4

review_406043,entertainment,"So beautiful! This park is the perfect place to come to pretend you are in the middle of nowhere and admire the great natural beauty of Arizona. Even before entering the park it's easy to feel like you've left society and heavy development behind, because all you can see are rocky mountains and miles of cactus and all you can hear is nature. My boyfriend and I did the North Trail, which was very scenic. There are trail markers around & a trail guide at the beginning so you can do a self guided tour, but most of the stops were kind of boring or the plant that was supposed to be there was dead. I think it would be really great for kids, but adults can probably skip it. My only complain about the trail (and it's really not a valid complaint) is that the entire trail is flat so it was too easy. The park is really well maintained, as in the bathrooms are clean & stocked with toilet paper and soap. The rangers are really nice & helpful and will definitely help you figure out a good trail for you.",3

review_626078,entertainment,Great casino lay out really gives you a nice vibe home town feel as far as the rooms go they are a modern room witch are clean and nice but I am not amazed with service and I am not the type of guest that wants special services all I want is the mini fridge to be open not locked and room service food that I ordered made McDonald's chicken strips look like a 5 star grommet food (I have pictures posted ). If it was cheaper then other luxury resort then I'd shut up but when I'm paying the same price as Palazzo or Caesars then I expect service to be somewhat close. I hate to complain because I'm in the service industry but Jesus Christ I ask for simple things and I don't believe it's up to par to compete with other major resorts SLS In Beverly Hills makes this resort look like a 2 cent Vegas escort.,0

review_281998,entertainment,"We used to really like this place, but lately they keep disappointing us.  \n\nGood things:  They have all night drink specials, so if the game goes past happy hour, its not a big deal.  Lots of TVs, good atmosphere, good food, never overly busy to accomodate a group.  Their food is pretty good and drink prices are fair.  Some of the wait staff are nice.\n\nBad things: They've changed their menu a little bit so some things aren't included in happy hour appetizers anymore- throw some chicken tenders or something in there please.  A girl can only eat so many chips.  They need to get more beers on tap- that's just weird for a sports bar.\n\nBut my biggest complaint.  If I'm coming to a sports bar, it's to watch a game.  Don't take 15 minutes to get it on the TV.  And if there is a group of 5-10 people sitting in front of a TV cheering on our team, don't change my channel.  This has happened a couple times at this place.  And it's not like there aren't a million other TVs that nobody is watching- this place isn't that busy.  They need to get a more organized process for managing the TVs.  Most sports bars walk up to the TV, point at it, and ask if anyone would mind if they change it....sounds fairly simple.  And seriously, if we start screaming when you change the TV, don't fill 5 people's beers before you put my game back on.",2

review_130116,entertainment,"Okay, this is the first hotel I ever stayed at in Vegas and guess what... I was a kid at the time. So I am writing the review from a kid's perspective (and also a little bit from my parent's perspective).\n\nA lot of reviewers have given this hotel a low star rating and not without reason. The hotel & casino is not the BEST hotel/casino in Vegas and may actually be one of the worst for adults who want to party and gamble a lot, but if you are traveling with children and want everyone to enjoy their time this is by far the best hotel.\n\nWhen my family stayed here (back in the 90's) my siblings and I practically lived in the amusement park. We got a 2-3 day pass and spent most of our waking moments there. We rode all of the rides, watching the \""street\"" performers, ate the junk food, played the games and had a grand old time... while my parents enjoyed a cocktail/beer and some light gambling (they aren't big drinkers or gamblers so they were satisfied) and some ALONE time. They didn't have to keep an eye on us because the four of us were in a fairly secure environment and were able to look after each other so they actually got a little break during their vacation (we were traveling around the country via RV for 3 weeks prior to Vegas). They were even able to enjoy a dinner together, as a couple. It may not have been the flashy, fancy Vegas but it was special to them nonetheless.\n\nPlus, the circus that takes place in the neighboring tent provided my youngest sister a special outing with just her and my parents while us older kids laid around watching TV (something we WANTED to do).\n\nThe pool on the rooftop was pretty disappointing because it was small, cramped and HOT. Sure it was the middle of the desert in the middle of the summer, but the boring concrete hole did not please us at all. We stayed for a total of 5 minutes at the pool and called it quits.\n\nThe hotel is situated at the end of the strip (well almost. Not as bad as the Stratosphere) so it does limit your mobility if you choose to venture from the Circus Circus grounds. We decided to hop in the minivan and make the journey down the strip to Excalibur (clear at the other end) to watch Medieval Times, but traffic was a nightmare. Needless to say, we would have been better off walking the 4 miles. LOL\n\nThe rooms weren't fantastic and there were problems even back then. So I can understand why people would be complaining about the rooms now.\n\nSo maybe things have drastically changed for the worst in the past 13 years, but for a family spending just a few nights in Vegas it was the ideal location.",2

review_401110,entertainment,"I must preface this review by saying I grew up in New Jersey and frequented Atlantic City countless times.  Perhaps gambling and gaming have different rules here in Pittsburgh then in AC but.... one super downfall for this casino; you pay for your drinks.  WHAT !!! In AC, if you are in the Casino and playing you will get free drinks.  You give a good tip to the server and drink all night.  Well here, you pay for your drinks, not much ($3-10) but still it makes the night more somber.  One of the perks to gambling is the free drinks, well FREE is a misnomer but, you know where I am going with this.\nThat being said, it is a very small Casino in comparison to Atlantic City and paying for drinks ... well .. that sucks.  \nI did win a bit at craps and left the Casino ahead, so I guess it is a win for me.  \nIm not a gambler so not sure Ill go back anytime soon but, I can say this, if they offered free drinks like AC does, I may be inclined to go back just for a day of fun.",1

Working downtown, I've learned the place does a nice weekday lunch business too! \n\nI've always had great service here, the staff is friendly and patient (I'm indecisive). There's a great selection of wraps (Chicken Caesar was fresh and light), baked goods (my croissant was buttery and delish) and coffee drinks galore. As a Starbucks loyalist (I will not be judged!) I rarely veer from my beloved cup, but I can vouch for the iced coffee here. Strong, just like I like it. But my favorite part about the place is the environment. You can slap your iPad on the counter and eat there or grab a couch or table seat and get comfy. Go more than once because your eyeballs won't have time to capture everything in one visit. There are zines in the back, flyers for local events up front and an art gallery down the hall.

review_468445,entertainment,"I am definitely a fan of the Las Vegas County Saloon! LVCS is located on Fremont Street on the second floor above Hennessey's. There's a small banner advertising the Saloon but if you didn't know what you were looking for you'd probably miss it. LVCS is a great music venue that caters to niche markets in music. The venue seems to host a lot of metal, punk, and hip-hop artists. I just recently went to see Nile at LVCS. \n\nThe stage at LVCS is small but allows for a more intimate experience with bands. The drinks are expensive,  but are on par with the prices you'd pay at the House of Blues at Mandalay Bay or the Pearl at the Palms. There was a promoter who was passing out 2 for 1 drink passes that we were able to use at the bar inside the venue. Since my husband and I are accustomed to paying $10+ for a beer at concerts, we were pretty stoked we could catch a break for once. The bartender was awesome! She was slammed but we never had to wait longer than a minute to get our beers.\n\nLVCS has a great view of Fremont from the concert area and the outdoor smoking section, so there are plenty of opportunities for people watching. The bathrooms were clean but I almost slid off the toilet because the seat was unhinged- but no worries because this is a freaking metal venue! \n\nSecurity lets people get pretty rowdy in the mosh pits, which is cool. Ticket prices are extremely reasonable and much cheaper than the venues in casinos.  Again,  love this place!",3

We brought only our phones, id, and some cash since we knew how strict it was. \n\n....We were nagged by security quite a bit (don't sit in front of the reserved area, make sure your towel fits the line of the outer ledge..) and didn't drink anything since it seemed like a pretty good waste of money. It was fun watching people prance around in all their naked splendour, but we left in about an hour.\n\nI just felt so hemmed in by all the restrictions though! I understand, but it was just a lot of work and feeling like a criminal to just dip in your feet!",1

review_409392,entertainment,"Matt Goss has a terrific voice and is quite a showman.  His show had a couple of spot on covers and some of his original music as well.  I would imagine that he will go on to bigger and better things.\n\nThe whole ticket/seating issue was a pain.  The tickets listed a 10.00 start time, but not so - after standing in line from 9.30 on we were finally seated a bit after 10.00.  We also found out that while the tickets are classified as general seating, all of the good seats have a 2 drink minimum.  The guy handling the seating was a bit of a snake.\n\nThe opening act is a bit confused  and jumbled with both an airline and James Bond 007 themes.  That confusion continues throughout the show - it is a small room and very small stage, yet he has a 6 piece band, 2 back up singers and 4 dancers.  \n\nThe music is very good and while the show is pretty tight there are times that there is just too much and it overwhelms Goss.\n\nSo, all of that said, you should definitely see Matt Goss if in Vegas .  He puts on a one heck of a show.",3
review_506385,entertainment,"ENJOYED THE SHOW!!!\n\nWent on a whim not really knowing what to expect. Had heard it was \""raunchy\"". We found it very entertaining! A bit raunchy at times but not as bad as we expected. We are in our 50's and were not offended even though my wife is a bit of a prude (and a minority!)! We sat in the back section on wooden bench seats but found the view perfectly fine. In fact all of the seats nearer the stage were small wooden folding chairs and seemed very cramped in comparison.",3
review_366638,entertainment,"Maybe it's my fault for not doing my research before choosing a place to spend New Year's, but my experience last night has guaranteed that American Junkie will not get any more of my business. \n\nLike almost everyone else who showed up early, I assumed their flyer advertising free cover before 11 and a free champagne toast at midnight was legitimate. What I found instead, was that the management lied, (they even admitted it to our faces), and guys were now $20 to get in. (girls would be $10 after 10)\n\nHalf our group (mainly the girls) had already gone inside when we discovered that the guys we were with had to go hunt down ATMs, coming back to a line that was poorly-managed and about 2 hours long. \n\nAm I stupid for planning around a NYE flyer? Maybe. I'm new to Scottsdale and apparently not savvy enough to realize that some clubs in Old Town will just flat out lie to their patrons. They know they'll get hordes of rude douchebags knocking down their doors to come inside anyway. WHY?? Why was I even there and why did I give them my business? Never again.\n\nOh, and the inside was packed like sardines. They let in so many people that fights were breaking out left and right, getting a drink was hopeless, and bathroom lines were a half hour long. People were hopping the fence to get in, sick and tired of the line outside. But those in our party who had to wait so long to get in were disappointed anyway.\n\nWe stayed till midnight, thinking JUST MAYBE the bar would keep one promise they'd advertised all over their website, and pass out flutes of champagne. Nope.\n\nThis would have never happened in Downtown Phoenix. I know it's just a bar, but honestly people, we need to hold places accountable for deception. My friends and I planned a night out that got ruined... and half our party left, fed up with the situation.\n\nDon't go to American Junkie... it is just that, junk.",0

review_487114,entertainment,"I came here today (a Sunday) with my whole family (two adults and three teenage kids) to see a movie. We walked in and the place was completely empty, regardless of the fact that it was a Sunday night-- no customers present. Anyhow, we went in and proceeded to buy tickets but were refused because all viewers of the movie had to be 17+ because they serve alcohol in the theater...? Despite the fact that all of the teens in our group were chaperoned by parents, some were aged 17, we were still refused. This seems like a dumb concept 1. Considering the poor location of the theatre that once went out of business (that still receives very little business) and 2. That the nearby iPic theaters admit viewers of all ages to their cinemas even though they serve alcohol. When we asked the lady at the ticket counter why the teens in our kids couldn't be admitted with parental supervision, her response was rude and abruptly cross. Regardless of their \""policies\"" or regulations, of which similar and better theaters don't have, we took our business somewhere else. If you are looking for a family environment, please look elsewhere.",0

review_160479,entertainment,"I've been to the Bellagio a few times and it's always fun.  Located at a great spot on the strip.  Seems to be the epicenter of great spots; restaurants, shopping, etc.  The fountains out front are gorgeous and if you are unhappy with your room they will move you somewhere you like.\n\nMy friends always get a room with a fountain view.  They usually have a drink and watch the fountains before heading out for the night.  One other thing we usually do is reserve chase lounges at the Cypress pool.  It's not cheap, $75/day, but it's worth it.  Great service and staff, and no jockeying for chairs.\nIf you're a gambler the casino is supposed to have the best odds in Vegas.  I don't know about that but the dealers are friendly.  I'm not much of a gambler so you'll have to see for yourself.\nIf you've never stayed here I encourage you to give it a shot.  If you don't like the smell of flowers when you enter, the 2 story chocolate fountain might get you.  Whatever your flavor, The Bellagio, while not cheap, is worth the visit.",4

review_490587,entertainment,"Science and Technology museums are amazing places. They give you the same feeling that Disney World gives, the feeling of absolute amazement. And the Centre des Sciences de Montreal is the perfect example of that. \n\nThe museum is full of interactive exhibits. Both for the kid and the adult. Though it does appear their main demographic is the age group full of wonder (e.g. Kids). But that does mean adults can not enjoy it. And there s a sweet pedulum ride for those under 250lbs. Plus when I went there were dinosaurs. Who does not like dinosaurs?!  \n\nBut there are some cons to this place. The first has to be the price. While it is definitely worth paying for. It is not worth 13 bucks. The exhibits are nice. But not that nice. It appears that they want to watch the IMAX movies. Which is nice. But I don't want to spend my whole day in the museum. When it is located in the Old Town. Which is just fun to walk around. \n\nBut even with all those perks and problems. It is still worth a visit.",2
review_160189,entertainment,"Ever since my first trip to Vegas I've wanted to stay at Bellagio. It may be past its prime as THE luxury resort/casino, now that the Wynn and Aria (etc) have opened, but I have a weakness for European-style elegance. In fact, \""stay at Bellagio\"" is on my bucket list-- right between \""visit New Orleans\"" and \""see a movie at Hollywood Forever Cemetery\"".\n\nThis March I siezed the opportunity, thanks to an Expedia deal, and booked 2 nights at the Bellagio. I was sure that using an online booking service would mean that we would end up with a lousy room next to the elevators and overlooking the parking lot. I was so surprised when our room was located on one of the higher floors and had a wonderful view of the pool area. The room was lovely! Entryway with tile floors, huge bathroom with soaking tub and glass shower, large marble-topped vanity, plush beds, massive lighted armoire/entertainment center, push-button blackout curtains. \n\nCheck-in was swift and courteous. In fact, every staff member we encountered was nothing but pleasant and friendly to us. From the maintenance man who fixed our in-room safe (it just needed a replacement battery), to the valets and bellhops, to the random employee in the halls. We were always treated as VIPs, even though we're far from high rollers. \n\nNot only was I able to cross this item off my list, but I thoroughly enjoyed the experience!",4

Lets face facts, the igloo was old, tired, and for those of you who wanted to save it....why? \n\nI gave the \""Con\"" only four stars because traffic after a game is a nightmare. We were stuck inside the Marriott's parking garage for forty-five minutes after the Pens stunning 3-2 victory against the Boston Bruins, saving their offensive outburst scoring 3 goals in the last five minutes. The new arena is surrounded by two lane streets, so traffic builds up quickly.\n\nThe Consol Energy Center is bright, airy, lots of room to walk around, there isn't a bad seat in the house, and tons of food choices. I had a mushroom burger from Burgatory, and like the restaurant it was delicious. The sound and visual effects are amazing and the team is great. \n\nAll in all of the four new sports venues in town, PNC Park is still number 1, but the Consol Energy Center is a great place for Hockey, wrestling matches, basketball games and concerts.

review_399140,entertainment,"12/29/11.\n\nI probably should rate with one star, but at least the organizer TRIES, by providing free wine and service.\n\nI have attended quite a few of the weekly Thursday events. Each Thursday the organizer selects a different venue (he's picked one venue twice, since I've started going), provides his own 2 wines (a red blend and a white blend, both quite good), and the venue usually will create/provide especially priced bites to eat. So far, UNTIL tonight, all has been quite good.\n\nTonight I went because (1) the chosen venue this evening was very close to my condo (2) since the venue, the Ovation Room inside Green Valley Ranch Resort, does not have food to provide, there was an offer of 15% off dining at ANY of the restaurants within Green Valley Ranch Resort if you show the wristband provided by Rock N Roll Wine.\n\nWell, we tried to use the 15% discount at Hank's Fine Steaks & Martinis. The \""suit\"" there told us that Stations Casinos had NOT authorized the 15% being offered by Rock N Roll Wine. (See my separate Yelp review of them. I'll never return to another Stations Casino ANYTHING. I'm done with them.)\n\nAnd if you go to the Rock N Roll Wine Facebook page, you'll see a few other attendees who attempted to use their 15% discount, to similar response from GVR management.\n\nSo I think I'm done with RNR Wine.

review_127221,entertainment,"Let's be honest, Excalibur is 20 years old (1990 - 2010), it's not the latest and greatest on the strip and is starting to show its age a little bit. It's on the south end of the strip and is almost the last stop. You're not going to get the all the action of say Caesar's in the middle of the strip, or all the bells and whistles of a newer casino.\n\nThat said, you're not going to pay for all of that either. I paid $44 a night and had one of the best experiences you could hope for at that price. The room was clean and had perhaps one of the most comfortable beds I've ever had. The check in was smooth and quick. The staff was friendly. I even got a couple of coupons for free drinks and games.\n\nAll in all, I would highly recommend Excalibur to anyone who's looking to travel to Vegas on a budget.",3

Unfortunately the bouncers wanted to let the girls in right away and have the guys wait in some huge line so they could 'keep their numbers even'.  HELLO Dumb@$$... we are a group of mostly couples... no one is gonna let their date go into the club an hour before them.  F**kin idiot.

Parking is $5?  What?  I should have parked across the street.\n\nNow the tickets are not just the price you are quoted, they are marked up by a $3 service charge at the box office.

There is a concrete floor, poor paint, and nowhere to sit.  The drinks are way over priced ($7 a shot for Jager!!!

review_635690,entertainment,"Pork Rinds and Fried Chicken ? YES PLEASE ! The New Brooklyn Bowl in Vegas is quickly gaining popularity because of its concerts and location at the Linq entertainment area. However, you do not want to miss out on the food because it may be the best part of Brooklyn Bowl and if you time it correctly you can still see and hear the music for free and skip the price of a ticket. Simone and I timed our dinner just right so we got to hear the nights Band rehearsing their set before the concert that night and although it was loud it was still pretty awesome. While taking in the sounds we drank a very good Drunken Palmer drink which was basically Sweet Tea, Lemonade and lots of booze. After starting those, our appetizers of Potato Knishes and House Fried Pork Rinds arrived.  The Potato Knishes were good and reminded me of fried mashed potatoes but with a lot more onion flavor. They were served with sour cream and mustard and were enjoyable but nothing compared to the Pork Rinds. The Pork Rinds are all kinds of fabulous (and fabulous is a word I try not to use often). Man, these things were crispy and salty and crispy and salty, and did I mention how crispy they were? They were like bacon on steroids. They were topped with crumbled red onion and Queso Fresco Cheese and had the consistency of a cheese doodle.  They were  light and airy so they were not overly filling and by the time the entr\u00e9e arrived they were just about gone.  For the entr\u00e9e, we had Fried Chicken and I'll be damned, it was just as good as the Pork Rinds.  These guys in the kitchen know how to fry themselves up some good eats. The chicken was not heavily breaded and was coated with Matzo meal and then fried, so it didn't seemed as greasy or dense as the well known KFC chicken we have come to love (or hate).  We ordered a mix of Dark and White meat and both were equally good in flavor and moistness (that sounded really dirty).  I think they were eight pieces of chicken and we were able to finish half of them. The rest were great as leftovers for breakfast a few mornings of our vacation.  The waiter suggested that we dip our chicken in honey and habanero oil that is house made. We took him up on the suggestion and sure enough the combination was delicious.  What a great meal. We skipped dessert after gorging ourselves on fried food but maybe next time.  I would definitely recommend Brooklyn Bowl for some great food and great music.",3

Nathan put on a truly stunning karaoke display. His opening number was good if not great, Twist and Shout... complete with the Ferris Beuler treatment. It was clear at this point that Nathan had the show after the first set. After some discussion and careful planning it was set... Nathan was going to bust out the Big Dawg for the second set. Now this is the point in the show that an artist has to let everything hang out... To take chances and hope for the best. Its on... \n\nTrey Anastasio of Phish once said in an interview that there were 2 artists that he has seen that always had the audience completely locked in and focused on what was going on, on stage. These 2 artists were Frank Zappa and Jerry Garcia. Trey has obviously never seen Nathan Simpson perform Lets Get it On. Some like to call this the human magnet others just like to call this EPIC! After a miscue on the opening line, Nathan rebounded nicely and served up a gem. By mid Getting On, a stage that was occupied by Nathan was now occupied by 4 other people, 3 of which being female and one of which being fucking hot. By the time the last notes were played we all just sat in awe... Thanks Nathan.",2

review_199924,entertainment,"Really not feeling this place. Music is ok, dance floor is so so, pretty small. Had bottle service over here and the waitress kept coming by and topping off our drinks trying to get us out of there as quick as possible. They do this at every club in Vegas but at this one the waitress was a little on the rude side. It's the only club I been to in Vegas where we had bottle service and did not enjoy it.  The music wasn't all that great either. It's pretty small for Vegas club too.  Never went back!",1

Need 10+ for that. \nWe got there and my mom did a shot at the front bar. After gearing up in the warm black coats & boots we headed in. Everyone really enjoyed themselves. They made good drinks and played fun music. \nYes, I snuck a disposable camera inside and took pictures when the employee with a camera had her back to us. \n\nI would definitely go here for a fun time.

review_409030,entertainment,"C'mon. This is MGM... one of the best casino/hotels in Vegas. And they house this? MGM should be ashamed. Granted, I could see this at the Excalibur or Luxor (and that isn't a dig; I love staying at the Excalibur), but the quality doesn't match MGM. It is way overpriced. There are coupons that shave a couple bucks off of it, or you can go with a package deal. Either way, CSI isn't worth it. It takes about 10 minutes to go through. You have these sheets on clip boards, and you go through \""evidence stations\"" that are crowded with other people. These \""stations\"" are like tiny puzzles that any moron with even a second-grader's logic could figure out. This might be good if you have 6-12 year-olds that happen to like the TV show, but this is not an attraction for adults or older teens.",0

I had a really fun time in kahunaville (their bar) and recommend that Kahuna Mama drink!! \n\nThe location isn't the best because its almost at the end of the strip, but in all reality it isn't bad.. it's just a little walk up towards Caesar's Palace and the Bellagio area. Plus.. you get to see some interesting things on your walk.. ;) \n\nIf you are here to party instead of having the classy visit in a penthouse this is a pretty cool place. It has good views (if you get the right room) and you will run into some fun people. \n\nThe pirate's/sirens show was out of commission when I was there--boo to that. \n\nThey have a pretty cool casino and it's actually pretty big--I got lost getting back to my room. Yikes! (Maybe that was the alcohol.. ha)\n\nI stayed here while driving across the country with my friends & it was our best night across the states... so hopefully this is helpful!

review_508199,entertainment,"My now fiancee booked the a sixty minute Gondola ride for his proposal to me this past Sunday at sunset and it was amazing!!! Our gondolier was amazing! His name was Angel and he was very nice and cordial. First he  set up some great sparkling water and deserts for us to enjoy during the trip and supplied us with blankets to keep warm in case we were chilly. Then, we set off for our cruise, we kissed under the replica of Ponte dei Sospiri which was sooo sweet. As we progressed he pointed out all the lovely mansions to us and even sernaded us as we gently floated along the current. The best part was the proposal, apparently he suprised not only me but also my finacee. He placed the wedding proposal in a bottle that floated along the top of the water. As I discovered the bottle my finacee passed a camera back to him. We have pics of EVERYTHING, pics of me reading the message in the bottle proposal, pics of my fiancee placing the ring on my hand and even of our kiss shortly thereafter. Angel was amazing, now we have the whole sequence of events on film and my family and friends love seeing them. He again serenaded us before returning to shore and it was wonderful! We also need to thank Anne of Gondola Adventures because she helped plan and organize alot of the details as well. Anne and Angel are wonderful, it was the most perfect proposal in a hidden gem of a place. No one could ask for better service. We very highly recommend Gondola Adventures. I can't wait to go back for your anniversary!",4

review_367051,entertainment,"I have lived in Phoenix my entire life, and for some reason I never knew about Lookout Mountain. I guess I had heard the name, and definitely knew the area, but it never occurred to me that there were hiking trails there. It wasn't until my Dad told me about his recent hike up the Summit Trail, that I realized what a hidden gem Lookout Mountain was.\n\nThe Preserve is a great location for North Phoenix residents who'd like a moderately easy hike that offers a great 360 degree view of the city. You can see skyscrapers from downtown (preferably a better view when the brown cloud isn't so distracting) and even a view of the Cardinal's stadium in Glendale. \n\nThe hike itself isn't too difficult. It's a quick and steep hike to the top -- only a little more than 1/2 mile, but much easier than Piestewa Peak and definitely easier than Camelback Mnt. The Summit Trail is rocky and not much to see as far as vegetation and scenery, but once you make it to the top, the view is wonderful.  The elevation is about 2,000, which is comparable to the other major mountains in Phoenix. And, if you'd like a more leisurely hike, there are plenty of other trails in the Preserve area to enjoy.\n\nOverall, I'd say Lookout Mountain Preserve is another fantastic hiking choice for taking kids, dogs, or visitors to so they can enjoy the weather and scenery that Phoenix offers.",3
review_184911,entertainment,"Please people really? Club is beautiful. 1 star for that. Way overpriced and catered to all the VIP bs. Yeah you're so cool for spending $1,000's on some juice and a bottle of grey goose. The dance floor is not very big for the size of the venue. Waterfall is bigger. What is up with all the clubs playing techno music? It sucks. The drinks are way over priced and the waitress had to have a card prior to bringing us our drinks. Four of us girls were sitting on a bench and were asked to move because it was becoming a VIP sitting area. Nice huh? We just paid $20 cover and bought $100 worth of drinks within 20 minutes of being inside. Get your poor  butts up because you are not valued here is how we felt. We will never visit this club again.

review_576083,entertainment,"This place is beautiful. It's 1/2 outside on a rooftop with nice views, and 1/2 inside with also nice views! I loved the split because if the weather isn't pleasant you can always do inside, but if the weather is nice you have the rooftop patio option. :)\n\nGetting in and up is fairly easy. Look for the sign hanging in the walkway near Gringos. There's a man standing there who'll check your ID and mark your arm. There wasn't a line and he was nice! Then you're allowed to go inside to take the stairs or an elevator up. \n\nOnce up, it's pretty chic and somewhat dim, like a retro penthouse. Now although this place was decorated and presented nicely, the attire of everyone there was way too casual. Most everyone wore pants and a tank top or shorts and it was a Saturday night, come on people! The place was great though despite the odd crowd.\n\nInside is a long bar with couches against the large glass windows with lovely views. There's also a dance floor thank goodness. But the DJ only played electronic music, no hip hop. :(\n\nThe bathroom was interesting. The ceiling was covered with black and white images of famous icons like Elvis, Monroe, Hepburn, Clooney, etc. Not sure about the men's of course. Should of popped my head in there. :P\n\n Outside is more of a mingle type atmosphere. To me that's boring and I'd rather dance, but I'm sure many people like that option. You can mingle and talk inside but the music is kind of loud (more of a club atmosphere in there). Outside is more of a lounge vibe, where you can lean against the edge of the rooftop and talk romantically to your significant other or person you're trying to pick up, whatever floats your boat. But it's nice regardless.\n\nObviously, I liked this place and will be back. :D",3
review_610544,entertainment,"I tried a kickboxing class- they offer your first one free, they then gave me a free 2 week pass.  The staff was very friendly and the people attending were a good diverse group people of varied fitness levels w/ the majority being women.  The class I attended was kickboxing on a Monday at noon.  It was a great workout & music that fit in really well.  \n\nAnother reviewer commented on all the empty space and that they should fill it w/ more equipment.  However, this space is used during different phases of the classes taking place so that actually makes sense.  But when you first walk in you do feel like it is kind if empty so I can see why that was mentioned - but it is actually a good thing & all of the things one actually NEEDS to get in / stay in shape are there.  \n\nThe only thing that I could suggest is the option of mats for the floor work portion of class.  Also, the gloves they gave me were kinda stinky... I would suggest buying/ bringing your own . \n\nOverall, I plan to go back- it has what you need & seems more friendly & less boring than the usual /typical gym.",3

We took our daughter to check out the shark reef @ mandalay bay and were done in under 45 minutes. The place is small and felt cramped compared to other aquariums. The only \""cool\"" factor was going through the tunnel in between the tanks. If you are desperate to kill sometime with your family then consider the aquarium for a visit.

Sure, you might have to buy a few days in advance to get the optimal seating, but hey, the early bird gets the worm. Just don't be the late one.\n\nThe tickets, concession stand items, and the beer were all reasonably priced. Every employee was extremely friendly and even more professional. We got to our seats (which no one took, woo hoo!) and were instantly impressed with the reclining seats and tray. Took me a few minutes to realize that the tray moves so that my snacks can be right in front of me. Boom. Even more impressed. About halfway through the movie I realized that no one had asked me to move my seat so they could get passed me. I looked up and saw that even if I was fully reclined, there was still more than enough room for people to pass without even touching you. That took the cake for me.\n\nI am never going to any other movie theater. Ever.\n\nThe perfect cinematic experience.",4
review_48977,entertainment,"Absolute great place to learn or just squeeze in a quick 9-hole round. Clubhouse serves a great lunch/dinner, live music at nights later in the week, and ice-cold Hopshock always on tap. Service of the pro shop and the restaurant is pretty good.\n\nThe best part about Shalimar are the lessons from Tyler and Paul. I was a TERRIBLE golfer when I started earlier this year. My swing is starting to get there with their help and I couldn't be happier. Buckets are reasonable priced to work on your swing, and a 9-hole round with cart is pretty cheap (especially now).\n\nFootGolf is a great idea and fun to play. It can be challenging at times for actual golfers to play around the big groups, but if you check their schedule on when the FootGolfers are allowed, they are easily avoided. Heck, buy a 6-pack from the clubhouse and play a round of FootGolf for yourself and see why the popularity is growing.\n\nAll-in-all, I love going to Shalimar. I have made it my home course while I am learning to play the game and I would recommend it to others.",3
review_309516,entertainment,"Bless me Yelp for I have sinned. \nIt has been two and a half months since my last review.\n\nTo be honest, I haven't really been going anywhere. However, I did make it to CR last week and decided to come talk about it.\n\nI had been here a few times prior, but it was always on the weekend in the evening. At this time, this place pretty much sucks - that is unless you like to wait in line, hang around with the type of people that would party at a country/rock nightclub located in a strip mall, deal with bad service, and have no place to sit. If that's your bag, then go here and fill it up.\n\nThe other day, I was there on a weeknight right around 7pm. I even stayed for a few hours and ordered food and drink with someone. We don't have a great idea of what the food is like because we only had salads. My Caesar was merely okay. I would eat it again. The other salad was reportedly good. Our drinks were pretty awful though. Margaritas made with cheap liquor... gave us both headaches. They also didn't taste very good. \n\nOn the other hand, their menu had many greasy deep fried things or meaty beef things that sounded like they might be good. The service was good - but that's got to have everything to do with the fact that the place was pretty empty. That didn't stop them from playing Mtv from the 80s - from Bon Jovi to Billy Idol. \n\nThis place also had a bull that I suppose could be ridden by drunk college kids. It wasn't operational while we were there, but I can't imagine it being as entertaining as Saddle Ranch. Having been to the one in LA and the one in Phoenix, I can say that few places can really top or rival the tragic humor that is watching Saddle Ranch bull riding.\n\nBasically, Cadillac Ranch is a generic strip-mall restaurant/bar that has decent service (when it's slow) and edible food. This place has a theme that's a combination of a few different things - none of which accomplished to any sort of accuracy. It's just really average.",2

It was entertaining but I didn't find it riveting like I like my Vegas shows to be. It was more of a concert with dancing than a show I felt. It was literally just playing Beatles songs (which sounded awesome) with performers dancing/acting out the songs. I felt like I was at a concert more than anything. I've been to Cirque du Soleil shows before and this one was eh. The costumes weren't as creepy/bizarre/eye catching as I thought, there weren't as many stunts as I expected and they weren't that extensive. The stunts pretty much just consisted of swinging from the ceiling, climbing ropes, roller skating and jumping around.  And I am a Beatles fan, I knew all the songs & was singing along. It was good but I just felt unsatisfied and a little disappointed, I think my reaction was, \""That's it? This is what the hype was about?\"" There were cool parts- like in the beginning when this creepy looking guy with a tea pot was walking around pouring the steam brewing out on people's heads or when a large sheet came down covering everyone and the ending (parts of the show were trippy).

This was a dive bar,obviously catering to students. Since there was a basketball game in about an hour, there was a variety of ages present at the bar. If there was not a game, I'd venture to say that my boyfriend and I would have been the oldest ones in there (and I'm not even 30 yet yikes!). We barely made it in the door because all of the St. Bonaventure fans must have found out about Peter's being extremely cheap and they were hunkered at the bar and all of the tables. Now my boyfriend had been there before and while we did get our first beers downstairs (although it took at least 10 minutes to get served), we carried them upstairs and lo and behold, there were maybe 5 other people at the upstairs bar so we just stayed up there and had another drink after the first. I don't feel the need to ever come back to be honest, I may end up here again, only if going to a game at the Pete, but I prefer a little less rowdy now that I'm in the latter half of my 20s so I'd probably do The Porch for drinks next time before the game instead.",1

review_202838,entertainment,"Given the dramatic force produced when an atom is split, I assumed the museum would have been more dynamic.  Instead of housing lots of atomic testing relics, the museum provides more of a time line guide to the nuclear era.  There are some actual testing materials, but nowhere near the level of materials that I expected.  In addition, the military took plenty of video and photos of the atomic tests and even  manufactured villages and towns to see the effects of the bomb on structures.  But there's very little of these videos and photos at the museum.  It was a little disappointing.\n\nHowever, you should definitely make time to go into the Ground Zero Theater.  The room is rigged so that you get the feeling of sitting on a wooden bench in rural Nevada and watching an atomic blast.  The blinding light, the mushroom cloud and a wave of wind in your face as the blast wave hits you.  It's simple, but a fun way to get a better sense of what it was like to sit as a Vegas tourist and view an atomic test (and there's some great old advertising from the casinos who used to offer guest a picnic where they could view an atomic test).",1

review_404118,entertainment,"I've been here numerous times since 2008, but my most recent visit was on February 14th, 2014.  I came here on a late Friday afternoon to have lunch with my friends, while watching an Olympic hockey game on their biggest screen.  \""Lagasse's Stadium\"" used to be called \""The Palazzo Sportsbook Bar & Grill\"", before changing its name a few years ago.  I've watched NFL, MLB games, the World Cup, and now the 2014 Winter Olympics at this sports' restaurant.\n\nYou have the main central area where the most important game is being shown on their largest screen.  You have stadium seating that contains sofas, couches, seat cushions & coffee tables.  Plus, you'll have someone taking your orders and delivering your food to you!  This is the ultimate place to dine & watch a game; but if the main screen isn't showing your team, you can find the screen that is showing your game that'll also include your own personal couch or sofa for your seating pleasure.\n\nI remember coming here during the NFL season.  My 49ers weren't on the big screen, but I was able to find them somewhere else where I was able to sit & watch that game comfortably.  As for the menu, it's quite pricey for your typical American foods with limited selections.  If you just want to get a bite to eat and enjoy watching a sporting game with your buddies or even by yourself, you'll enjoy your time here.\n\nThis places was ultra awesome when I first went here back in 2008, but I remember the quality of their food didn't taste as good a couple of years ago.  It was more bland; but my most recent visit, their lunch items were very good!  I was pleasantly surprised, especially since my expectations had dropped in recent years.  If their food can stay as good as my February 2014 visit, I will definitely come back here during all my Vegas trips!",3

review_246737,entertainment,If your looking to rent bikes in Scottsdale this is the place to go.  They don't have a ton of bikes but we only needed two we found a coupon on yelp and after 3.5 hours of use our bill came to $23.00.  They are customer service all the way.  The great thing about renting from them is they are right on the Indian bend wash trail.  It goes north and south through Scottsdale.  We went towards Tempe and rode to the college what a blast the ride is so beautiful.  If we would have rented from the other guys around town \nour bill would have been close to $70.00.  We will definitely be back when In town.,4
review_411844,entertainment,"We stopped here for a quick drink inside the Miracle mall while waiting for the Marc Savard comedy show.  We sat down, spoke to the bartender for a bit, and ordered Waboritas, very good btw.\n\nHowever, yet another camera lady came and took a picture of us.  When I told her I did not want to buy the picture, she stormed away with a pretty bad attitude....\n\nDear Cabo Wabo / Planet Hollywood, please do not allow rude photographers ruin the experience of your guests.  \n\nCheers",2
review_184786,entertainment,"This place is kind of like the place that people who can't get into XS go to...like the bottom of the barrel, which unfortunately included me and my friends.  We were not going to pay $20-$40 just to get in and $15/drink at XS.  Since I was traveling with guys and girls, we knew it would be hard, so we stuck with Tryst where we knew someone with a booth.  I had been here about a year ago, and the crowd was definitely different.  I liked it better then.  I was just disappointed this time.  \n\nTwo stars for the following:\n\n1) Ladies got two free drink tickets on Saturday night (worth $15 each).  Not bad.\n\n2) Good service.  Even though we were using our drink tickets, the servers were still nice and made stiff drinks.\n\nStars deducted for the following:\n\n1) People still have to pay to get in...ughhhh (luckily, one of my friend's friends had a booth and had us come in for free)\n\n2) No guys whatsoever!! I don't know if it was the weekend we went or what, but the guy to girl ratio was like 1:5.  Totally disappointed.  \n\n3) They repeated their music the WHOLE night.   I heard at least 8 songs repeated during the 3-4 hours I was there.  No bueno.  \n\n4)  The dance floor was super small and the girls were super pushy.  \n\n5)  There's a stripper pole on one side of the club where a lot of drunk girls hung out.  There was one guy who came and actually did a good job on it.  Just as he was climbing the pole for his grand finale, he got pulled down by the bouncer.  Lame!!  He was just entertaining us!",1
review_362331,entertainment,"Came to Phoenix from out of town to visit friends and they brought us here for some drinks and a night out.  Well ... from my one night here, boy was it entertaining.  It was some sort of Santa Claus night where everyone was dressed as Santa - somehow we didn't get the memo.  While we sat there drinking decent drinks on the cheap, we watched as the Santa Clauses 1) did some uh in appropriate things 2) failed romancing 3 ) participated in crazy drunkenness.\n\nSo .. maybe not indicative of the place itself but I will remember this place fondly and might even make it there for the next Christmas.\n\nThe only negative was it was soo busy that the waiter took forever in the beginning and it was impossible to get a quick drink.  The crowd did thin out a bit as the night went out so that made it better.",3

Me and my cute gals had met some guys at Tao beach telling us to come to Bank and we could get in for free. Awesome! well we had one guy with us but he was willing to pay. We get there around 1 am because hey its vegas!...\n\nFirst and fore most the bouncers out front are complete DOUCHE BAGS!! they are the type to get rejected and they start to get into their feelings. The bouncer was rude to us we asked if we can get our guy friend atleast he said NO! sternly and walked off from us. RUDE! so he comes back my friend is trying to negotiate and he tells her \""Shutup you fucking loser\"" and pushes our guy friend! we all were so shocked!! i know this is Vegas but my friend nor me should be cursed at. and neither should my friend be pushed!\n\nSecond he lets me and two of my other friends in the club..we decided to do this because we figured maybe the guys could get the rest of our 3 girls in and the one guy since they had liked us so much lol. The bouncer or staff watever the hell he was leads us to the table but he left us he made sure to be a jerk and leave us trying to find where he went in a crowded club. When we get to the table i asked him nicely why he would leave us ? he says you left me not my problem. Now im pissed i asked him whats his deal and he says look ill kick you out of here now i told him you wont do a thing and walked off from him! he grabs my arm and im like do not touch me! or i will report you for harassment he tells me \"" I run all of this you hear me?\"" I really thought he was going to hit me and one of the guys from the table grabbed me to come up and dance. by then i was so shocked i wanted to leave. I ended up going across to club hyde and we all got in free the guy paid $20 awesome vibe , great music, free alcohol =]\n\nMoreover! if you just have to go to bank go because someones performing. And if you see a douchie Hispanic guy thats around 5'9 in height avoid him he seems to think his 12.50 an hour job means he runs the casino haha. All i can do is laugh and never go back. it was lowkey ratchet but the music was BANGING\n\nHORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE\n\n**If anyone who does management for this club i would advise getting less harassing employers. Theres plenty of Las Vegas clubs that look and sound way better than the \"" BANK\""",0
review_171832,entertainment,"Well I chose to come here - for a fun, adult only trip with my husband. However, Mandalay bay is VERY kid friendly. THe pools were full of kiddos and you couldn't bring your drink in the wave pool ( you may spill it - HI, what else do you think is floating in this water?! ). The room was older, but still nice. Aside from the kiddos in the pool, another reason I would not stay here is the insulation of the rooms is horrible. You can hear the people in the room next to your room. Also the elevators are slow and crowded! The casino floor is nice, the restaurant choices are nice and it's easy to catch the tram or head over to Excaliber or Luxor.",2
review_356715,entertainment,"Vue pretty much represents everything that is bad about cinemas today. It mostly shows rubbish, uninspiring films that appeal to soppy teenage girls and testosterone filled teenage boys. It sells overpriced drinks and snacks, which fools then proceed to munch all the way through your film (if you're hungry, go to a restaurant). It allocates seats and indulges in nonsense VIP seating (why should I have to pay an additional charge for a decent view of the screen). Plus, the poor staff look either bored or harangued and probably never even get to see any films. \n\nAVOID AT ALL COSTS.",0
review_595155,entertainment,"So when did I turn into a curmudgeon lol?? I was sooooo excited about staying here. I've partied in the casino circle bar before and had a blast but.... Overall, hotel looks cool, new, fun and plush in pics and I loved that it was off the strip (closer to LVCC for me) but.....I didn't like it. As my friends all know now the hotel stressed me out LOL. Too much black and white, no soothing colors. I was here for 6 days for work (2 for fun) and short of the food (was amazing!) nothing about this place relaxed me or said \""home\"" to me while I'm staying there. Nothing against the place but its all old and smokey now. People are loud in the hallways most nights. The party should stay on the casino floor no??? \n\nThe beds were hard, the pillows too soft. It took 4 to feel anything lol. I have to quote my friend when she said that the hotel is called Hard Rock because the beds are hard as rocks hahaha. I did LOVE the tub though. I stayed in the Paradise tower (by starbucks) and the tubs were like jacuzzi's! A big perk for me after being on my feet all day at a show. I felt save in the rooms because the doors are so heavy I didn't feel anybody being able to push the doors down to get in haha. Feels kinda like being in a bank vault (my friends quote again :) ). \n\nI also liked that the overall hotel was small so it was fast and easy to get to/from garage to my car daily. No time wasted on valet this time :) My bf also loves the gambling on the floor. He loved the tables (although the tables did not love him lol) and the machines. Drinks were expensive $10 at the bar or wait for waitress, while gambling on the tables and tip $5 each time or more if you want to see her often. I'm used to penny slots with frequent waitress visits with couple dollar tips! Economy hard for them too right??? \n\nI'd recommend staying here only if you are in fraternity/sorority here on spring break, if you are having a singles/bachelorette/bachelor weekend, on a kinky weekend away trying to save your relationship or if you are cougar/sugar daddy hunting lol. Otherwise, I would only come here to party and be on my way :)",1
review_571779,entertainment,"------ZARKANA------What a disappointment (Epic failure) only reason why I'm so mad is because we paid over $350 to see this show. We purchased 2 tickets and 2 tickets were comped they were in section 104 row B for last Sundays show. This is the worst Cirque du Soleil performance I have ever seen. The performance acts were average, I have seen them before at Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus for a lot less. The clowns were not funny the costumes sucked, they need to remove the guy who sings. Please do not waste your money on this show go to Mystere instead. Cirque needs to change the acts or it will fail like the Elvis show too. The only positive thing about the show is the beautiful theater and the comfortable sofa we sat in",0

review_45440,entertainment,"I discovered a hidden gem in Scottsdale and am pinching myself for not finding it sooner. For some reason, I also used to go south when I wanted to go bowling, but I now realize I should have gone north instead! After a day of spring training, we decided to make a stop by Brunswich Via Linda lanes for a couple hours of bowling fun and fun it was!\n\nI don't know what it is, but bowling alleys always strike me as shady but right off the bat, I was completely impressed with how \""non-shady\"" this bowling alley was. I could tell that this is a family-fun spot and one that is frequented often by locals. The bowling alley itself has several lanes, a fully loaded arcade room, a bar, food and even a \""gift shop\"" with bowling essentials! Sadly we didn't have any socks, but luckily for us, they had a vending machine that also sold socks. Yes they were a little overpriced at $2.50 but that's what we get for forgetting our own socks at home! The venue itself was clean and I didn't feel icky using the community shoes and bowling balls. In addition, they have hand santizer so I was able to get a swift cleaning to my hands after turn of bowling and before digging into the tasty popcorn. \n\nNow let's move on to the reason people come here: the bowling. It ended up being cheaper to purchase two hours of unlimited bowling so we went for that. While I won't be joining a pro bowling league anytime soon, it was a lot of fun and the bowling game went along seamlessly and without any issues! However, since we went for the two hours of unlimited bowling, it shut off right at two hours which didn't let us finish our game, so if you go that route remember to keep an eye on the clock! \n\nI have definitely found my new neighborhood bowling alley and can't wait to come back again. I might even join a bowling league. Any takers?",3
review_522193,entertainment,"I enjoy going to Xclusive for a lot of reasons; even though they might specialize in \""exclusive\"" VIP experiences, the part that I really love about it is that it is a nightlife home for Las Vegas locals.  Even though it is busy, the line is always manageable and the service is always friendly, making it a refreshing change from The Strip.  For the most part, locals have to pick between the hectic and often rude clubs on The Strip or local gaming pubs, without much in the middle.  Xclusive is perfect for going to relax, but still seeing people looking their best and there to party and dance, rather than silently drink at a slot machine.  The theme parties like the \""All White Party\"" are the best, but they always have something fun going on.  Fridays and Saturdays have the best party atmosphere--and their Sunday industry nights have recently gotten to be a big hit with locals, but you can still go and have a good time on the weeknights with karaoke night and other themes.",4
review_130738,entertainment,"I agree with a lot of the other posters on here about the inconvenience of the monorail. It seems to zig zag around a lot of the hotels and still leaves you a ways from your destination. Maybe it was the only option when they built it: don't let it block the casinos from adding more hotel rooms or other buildings if they wanted to in the future. I don't know. But you seriously have to slog it through casino after casino to get to the station. It sucks if you're staying at Excalibur or NY NY. The closest station is MGM Grand. You still have to hoof it through MGM to find the station. The signs can be deceiving in the casino. \nTaking cabs or just walking straight up or down the Strip can get you to where you want to go in the same amount of time. Too bad all the conventioners hear about a monorail, buy tickets and then leave. The monorail makes its money and keeps on running. I wonder if people will catch on eventually and not use it as much. It wasn't ever that full even during the massive convention I was at.",2

The tickets were a good value for the meal. It was a buffet style meal that included many options. The food was fresh and hot. Not like it had been sitting around for a while. The entertainment turned out to be wonderful. All in all, it was a great evening. \n\nThe second event was a private party. The staff was on top of the set up and maintained everything thru out the evening. Appetizers were served that appealed to both the adults and kids. We had the entire place and it was very nice to be able to be outside on the patio. It's a pretty location for an event.",4

That's because they have a great photographer inside who will take all the shots you want and you can then buy them later online or tag then on Facebook. \n\nThe bartender was fun and I was amazed that he didn't wear any coat. It was darn cold in there and holding a cup made of ice didn't help. \n\nAn experience worth going to at least once. It's Vegas and you only live once.",4

Okay fine, buy one bottle of Ketel and get one bottle of Ketel free right? He says yes.

The bouncer refused to grant us free admission despite the fact that it is advertised that hotel guests are free. The bouncer stated it was a privilege to gain free admission and we had to return before midnight if we desired free entry. (Privilege Please!!! We paid $300 plus a night for a suite in the Bellagio). \n\nI returned again on Sunday night at the Bank. This time before midnight. The doormen/bouncers were arrogant. I stated I was a guest at the hotel and they totally ignored me. I stood around for 15 minutes before I was gained entry. I left the club 5 minutes after and returned around 2 am to party at the Bank. I had to wait another 15 minutes to get in despite the fact that I was wearing a wrist band for entrance. \n\nThe door men here take themselves too seriously. They act with way more authority than necessary. Their job is simple, checking id's and letting guest in. They let guests stand way too long behind the rope while the walk bank and forth to decide who they should let in next. Patrons should receive more respect, after all, we the guests are ensuring their salaries are paid. Without a crowd the club would never be In business. \n\nThe managers need to work on their staff. I was treated with more dignity and respect at other clubs where I was not a guest at the hotel.

review_403843,entertainment,"Located at Bally's hotel and casino in Las Vegas, Indigo Lounge is a small lounge that opens up to the casino gaming floor.  There is a front area for live music.  A small (very small) dance floor.  Several small circular tables for two.  And a DJ in the back.\n\nIt is free (and there is no drink minimum).  Late at night, a cover band was playing--they seemed to focus on 80s rock music.  They were pretty good.  And the lead guy was kinda funny.  They did requests, but they admitted that they didn't know the lines to most of the songs (which resulted in some interesting butchering of songs).\n\nAt the very end of the night after the live entertainment ended, there was some dancing (a short period of time--maybe 3:15am to 4:00am).  It was not that busy.  The DJ played Sir Mix-a-Lot's \""Baby Got Back,\"" which resulted in some very interesting dancing from a young woman who was struggling to maintain her yard stick drink (some blue concoction) and maybe even her dress (similar to the first J. Lo dress that caused all that hoopla)...but to be honest, she was struggling with both.\n\nIf you are in Las Vegas and are looking for live music/and some dancing (though limited) but don't want to pay a high cover fee or get stuck in an overcrowded place, maybe you should give Indigo Lounge a chance.",2

While most Y's have moved into just watching your kids, offering some classes and functioning as a gym - this one has a full residential area as it's the oldest YMCA in the valley.\n\nOne especially interesting note - this YMCA had the first indoor, completely enclosed pool in the entire State.  How's that for cool?  Want to know something even cooler??  It's NOT on the first floor!!!  \n\nAs I don't have kids, and I have my own happy little casa, for me this is just a place to work out.  They really have an amazing gym. And it's not just one room - there are several rooms on several floors.  And if you're a member there aren't any extra costs associated with taking any of the other fun fitness classes either.  They offer some pretty cool ones too.  \n\nPersonal favorite - and I almost hate to mention it.  They have an outdoor running track. But it's not on the ground.

review_519639,entertainment,so beyond his hotness  jan rouven is a geniunely great magician.  I don't have a clue as to how he does his illusions and am scared for him.  He is an amazing person and very sweet.  What i would like to see is levetation kind of stuff but i don't know if he reads this or am kind of too shy to say that to him. I would be more than willing to practice this with him :) I am very entertained by him.  It is way more real than any  other magician i have ever seen. I think he can grow to the likes of david copperfield and criss angel not only because of his talents but his personality and carisma .  I have read parts of other reviews that may think he is a typical magician but he is what this town wants which is why i think he can develop into a more household name.  He is easy to approach and seems to really have a lot of respect for his fans.,4

We went on Monday at 7pm, had to park in the far lot down the street, walk eons to the zoo, wait in a gigantic line to get in and then walk in a huge wall of people. We bought tickets online while waiting in line and had to wait almost 15 minutes to get the confirmation email/barcode to get you through the gate.

From the time we parked to the time we actually stepped foot in the zoo was close to an hour. \n\nDo you see animals? nO\n\nDo you see Christmas lights? Yes. \n\nIs it worth $10 pp plus huge crowds?

review_154564,entertainment,"The nightclub has terrible service. Went to the BSB after party last night. Was a complete rip off. Had a VIP wrist band that I paid for $150. Was pushed, grabbed and shoved by security not allowing me to enter the club when the rest of the VIP was allowed inside to get first access to the pit where Nick Carter was DJ ing. The event was very poorly planned. Where the location of the Will Call was constantly changing. First it was supposed to be at the Mandalay Bay, then it was at the Hard Rock. No signs or staff was able to direct us to the right line. Once that was settled, we got a 5 second, 5 person group photo with Nick, Kevin and Howie. We never got out VIP lanyard because the said quote this is show 31 of 32. Also Hard Rock doesn't allow special VIP lanyards. Our group picture supposedly is ended up being posted on the Backstreet Boys website where once again supposedly we can download it. Overall, the club atmosphere sucked with people pushing including 99% of staff moving you. I didn't enjoy how overcrowded it was and how grossly overcharged for this event when people got in the club for $30-$40 and got better treatment than the VIP. What VIP???

Oh, if only drawing boards could make money.\n\nOne side of the bar/club/arcade has booth-style seating, with two tvs each and presumably the ability to play new games on new systems, all while imbibing with your friends.  That could possibly be cool, although you'd probably need a good number of folks to make it worthwhile.\n\nThe other side is lined with classic arcade games - you have your Tetris, Pacman, Frogger, incarnations of Street Fighter, the Simpsons!  They have handy coin-change machines to make you quarters.  But sadly, these retro games really do seem like they came from the 80's and 90's.  Controls can be very hit and miss with them, and yes, they didn't really look that good back then either.\n\nA nice place for nostalgia, but it feels like a strange place to spend time in when you're with friends, as most of the games are single-player.  Consider it a museum for times past.",2
review_236603,entertainment,"I LOVE staying at Caesars Palace.  Here's why:\n\n1. For the price that they charge, their rooms are pretty nice.  \n2. It was in the Hangover, and every time I stay I hope I see Mr. Chow! \n3. LOTS of food options...both fancy and affordable.\n4. It's in the middle of the strip, so you are pretty close to everything.\n5. Their pool is HUGE.  If you are not in the mood to go to a pool party, you can relax in one of their beautiful pools! \n6. Forum Shops are awesome...so many great stores!\n7. Serendipity 3 is right outside...they have the best triple decker grilled cheese and frozen hot chocolate.\n8. Great photo opps everywhere - so many sculptures!\n9. Their lotion smells fabulous.\n10. Great service.  Last time the guy upgraded us, just cause he was nice. Also, they were pretty quick at bringing extra towels, lotion, etc.\n\nOnly downfall: If it's your first time staying here, it's pretty easy to get lost.  The hotel is HUGE so make sure to ask for a map :)",4
review_370394,entertainment,We came origianally for the buffet and realized that the casino had a bowling alley. We decided to take our 3 kids upstairs and do some bowling. It was $26 for 4 of us for one game (residents get a little discount when you show ID). It was pretty clean and we really liked it. Will be visiting again for some more fun,4
review_155747,entertainment,"This was our second time seeing Penn & Teller in Las Vegas, and it was disappointing. We had excellent seats, but found the show significantly less engaging than on our first visit a few years ago. The selection of pieces was not nearly as inspired, and the balance between narration and magic weighed much too heavily towards the former. Penn's broken bottle juggle, in particular, had an introduction that was much too long for the payoff.\n\nOverall it felt a bit like Penn & Teller were going through the motions. Not to the extent of stage illusionists who only point at what's being performed by assistants, but still not feeling as fresh -- both for pieces we'd seen and ones we hadn't -- as the last time. I imagine that six shows a week gets to be a grind after awhile, and it's hard to put your whole heart into every performance.\n\nIf you like Penn & Teller, you'll enjoy the show, but you may or may not feel much electricity depending on how they're feeling that night. One of the best parts of the show is the jazz duo who warm up the audience for a half hour before the show; the pianist, in particular, is very entertaining.",2
review_153660,entertainment,Stayed here for the weekend on a Staycation with my husband. Great rooms. Lots of resturaunts to choose from with great variety. All the resturaunts give u A LOT of food.

review_122585,entertainment,This place is a great tour. I opted for a night tour. When you check in and wait for your tour you can browse the tour merchandise and they have a digital screen that you can manipulate to learn more history about Vegas. When the tour begins they talk about the history of the building that they are currently in and the glass slipper outside the building. Most of the history is based on why the signs are what they are and how they have come to obtain them and their future plans.\n\nThrough out the tour I was following and trying to listen to the tour guide but also wanted to take photos which is hard to do so I thought I would wait until the end thinking that we would have some time to just wander and take some photos but at the end the tour guide has to wait until everyone is out and it didn't feel like she was willing to wait that long so I didn't get so many photos as I would have liked. Which is the reason I gave it 4 stars. They should figure out a way for people to have a little more time at the end of the tour to look at the signs and take some photos other than just pushing them out right after the tour. \n\nBut I thought it was a great little activity to do while in Vegas.,3
review_123279,entertainment,"I'm fully aware that a normal person does not go and see a movie during a vacation in Vegas. Nevertheless, I was in Vegas and I wanted to catch Oliver Stone's 'Savages' and this was the perfect opportunity. I frequently stay at the Gold Coast and have always noted that the Orleans has a Century theater and this was my chance to check it out.\n\nI was kind of expecting they'd have a bar. It is Vegas. No bar. I should of pre-gamed, which I think I did. I go to primarily Century theaters back home and I think 3 stars is fair for this theater. It's a little run down; some updating and upkeep would greatly benefit the theater, and more importantly, a discount for hotel guests would be ideal. As for the layout of our auditorium, it was modern standard, with stadium seating, DLP projection, and Dolby Digital.\n\nWe paid $8 for an afternoon showing, which is pretty reasonable. If you're a local or a movie addict such as myself. I'd suggest checking out the Orleans theater. I'm pretty sure it's much cheaper than Brandon Theaters inside the Palms, which tends to be overpriced.\n\nPros:\n+ Modern theater w/ stadium seating, DLP projection\n+ Reasonable prices\n+ Post movie entertainment (gambling, booze)\n\nCons:\n- No discount for hotel guests \n- A little rundown and messy",2
review_175794,entertainment,"ummm, overrated?  so i went to vegas for my 21st birthday and as a 21 year old, i didn't expect an older crowd at pure.  but it was like over tanned desperate housewives up at pure that weekend.  perhaps it was the crowd that i wasn't feeling or maybe it was the expensive ass bottle of water that i refused to buy but my experience here wasn't that great.  we tried the roof but it was mostly table service and house music which does not equal dance music to me.  a few of my friends had an awesome time that night but me and mine cut out early.  the line was ridiculously long but luckily we were on the guest list thanks to a lovely hookup.  you think they'd be a little more organized about the guest list though, it was just a mob of people trying to catch the attention of the bouncer... who may i say had a little tantrum when i had all my guys go through.",1
review_224957,entertainment,"Went on a night when there was some sort of day-glow party going on.  The go-go dancers were in neon tutus, afro wigs, stockings, and bras with a black light illuminating everything.  Most were pretty lazy until the crowd started arriving.  I guess they were preserving their energy for the night.  The club's \""hype man\"" was running around blowing a whistle dressed as Mario from Super Mario Brothers, which was hilarious.  I think there was a Luigi, too.  The atmosphere was great as well as the DJ.  The outdoor patio with the view of the city was also great.  We got there right when it opened and were the first to hit the dance floor.  After 30 minutes, the crowds arrived and the dance floor filled.  The party atmosphere was in full swing and was a great time all around.",3
review_237671,entertainment,"You know my dog has it really tough.  After 8 hard hours of sleeping on my bed, he has to get up when I do, follow me around the house while I get ready and see me off to work.  Then it's outside for his sun bath, followed by 15 minutes of getting into stuff, and then a rigorous stretch.  Then a 4 hour nap, some sniffing, and then another nap.  No wonder he's so tired when I get home that he collapses on the nearest pile of laundry and proceeds to start snoring.  It's a ruff time (haha, I'm so flippin' funny.)  \n\nSo when he's stressed out and needs a break, we head on over to Cosmo Dog Park for Yappy Hour.  There is butt sniffing to do, pee mail to check, and all kinds of activities.  If the car is dirty and the weather is warm, we go in to the lake area where he can fulfill his dream of being a water dog.  After some swimming and splashing, and of course some vigorous shaking (as close to his human as possible, because the only thing hotter than lake water in your mouth is wet dog lake water hurled at the speed of light) it's off to the big dog area, for some running, ball chasing and agility fun.\n\nThey have well constructed agility equipment - yay for concrete, good watering areas, and TONS of room to run and romp.  Plenty of nasty tennis balls to throw, and most people are good about the poop scooping.  The fact they have a completely separate area for small dogs is a huge plus too.  \n\nOverall, while this is more of a drive for us, it makes my dogs day to go out and have fun at the park, and the quality of this park makes the extra miles well worth it.\n\nSide note:\nI'd love to kick the person who voted good for kids, dog parks are NOT FOR CHILDREN of the two legged variety.  Just because your kid likes dogs doesn't mean my dog likes kids.  He does, but I feel terrible when dogs trample toddlers, the screaming and crying gives me a headache.  Let me bring my baby (the furry kind that will never talk back) and leave your ankle biters at home.",4
review_99282,entertainment,"I remembered the good time I experienced here on our mandatory 6th grade field trip years ago, the jumping on trampolines, and the hand waxing and soldiers jousting tournaments. The nostalgia from years ago brought my friends and I back seeing if we can recreate new memories. Not surprisingly, it's a completely different experience as an adult.\n\nThe Arizona Renaissance Festival is a cash cow. You just go there to spend money. That's it. Tickets are $20 at Fry's grocery, $21 online, and $22 at the venue. But if your not a kid, the only thing to do there as an adult is shop. And shop for what? Renaissance things that you can really only use or wear at the Renaissance festival (I'm pretty sure my golden elf ears and leather medieval corset are not apart of my work's dress code). So you spend money on useless Renaissance attire, you spend money on drinks, and on food, and games, and event. The Renaissance Festival is not cheap.\n\nNow if you have kids, it's justifiable. People throw down dough to keep their kids happy and entertained and the Arizona Renaissance Festival is perfect for that. But if your a 20+ year old with no kids and looking for a fun time, there are better options in Arizona that are cheaper and more fulfilling.",2

review_530042,entertainment,"This place is fun!\n\nI love how they have converted and renovated this place to be a nice new casino. It's attached right next to the Flamingo and in a great spot on the strip. When I was staying at the Flamingo for a convention recently I was able to drop in a few times to check it out and play some blackjack. Ended up having a great time! Friendly dealers and bartenders. $5 and $10 blackjack tables! Low table limits! \n\nThe whole place feels upbeat and had terrific rock music playing along with the prerequisite Jimmy Buffet tunes. When I was walking through it seemed so laid back, with a tropical decor, bright colors, cheery, chill and relaxing. Seemed everyone who worked there said hello and had a smile on their face. Had no problem getting drinks as cocktail waitresses were always coming by and they are served up by cuties in bikinis! Even the crowd gambling here seemed more happy than at other casinos.\n\nOne thing I did notice is that this casino is on the smaller side, with a nice selection of the newest slot machines to go along with the standard table games, but not that many of them. It's a great spot to drop in to have a few drinks, gamble a bit, and begin your night of carousing. They even still have the outside balcony area overlooking the strip that you can drink on and people watch and make catcalls to the sexy ladies and gents passing by. \n\nEven if you are a parrot head or not then definitely check this place out if in Vegas.  The Margaritaville Casino is a fun time!",3
review_572954,entertainment,We were on vacation in Vegas and my girlfriend had looked up doing the trapeze lessons before we went out.  It looked like a lot of fun so we decided to try it out.\n\nThe location is right off the strip and very close to everything.  The folks there are very friendly and create a very fun environment to learn how to perform on the trapeze.  They take all safety precautions and I was comfortable through the entire process.\n\nThey start you off on a trapeze close to the ground and progress all the way to someone catching you from another trapeze if you are doing well on the lessons.  \n\nThe whole experience was a blast.  I would recommend it for most any age.  Go and play on the trapeze!,4
review_182964,entertainment,"So the view here is just WOW.  Totally the best part of the club.\n\nI came here on business w/ a bunch of clients who took us out for the night.  We had a private room reserved and all the alcohol we wanted to drink.  The best part was passing up the line and having to wait about 0.5 seconds to get in.  I also LOVED how they let my co-worker in who had a pair of Chuck Taylors on.  And you know how Vegas clubs are..... no nice shoes = no entry.\n\nDrinks were good since we had table service, so no complaints from me.  The decor was one of a kind.  I've never been to a club before that looked like this.  I kinda felt like I was in some kind of palace, and for a second failed to realize that we were in a club, lol.  The DJ was spinning some good danceable songs, but kinda switched it up too quick.  I saw some cuties here and there, and loved how some people danced even though there wasn't really a dance floor.  It never got too crowded and people were genuinely nice the entire night.  And oh, our waitress was mad foine and said she'd drink w/ me but never did.  Her loss.  LOL\n\nOverall one of my favorite clubs in Vegas.  I'm glad I came here and would definitely come back another day.",3

review_171628,entertainment,"So my brother wanted to go to this gaming convention but needed a chaperone and as an early Christmas present I accompanied him to Vegas so he can attend (but not before inviting a couple of friends to come!).\n\nThe convention was at the Mandalay Bay and they had really good deals for staying there. We paid on average $89 a night for two queen beds. The rooms were surprisingly big and clean. We had an awesome view of the pools (there seems to be like 5 of them!) and convention centers but it was a bit too chilly to actually go swimming. \n\nI had read that you can watch sharks on TV if you stayed at the Mandalay and after browsing through the channels multiple times...I failed to see any sharks. Sadface.\n\nI also didn't like the fact that it is at the very end of the strip and is SOOOO far from everything! Yes, there is a tram to Excalibur...but who wants to go to Excalibur anyways? Last time I came I stayed at the Venetian and it was considerably closer to all the major clubs! For the price, I think I was satisfied...but if it wasn't for my brother's convention being there...I probably would not have picked the Mandalay.",2

Definitely under no uncertain terms were we welcome in there that night. Stressed waitress who couldn't be bothered with any more festive cheer?

review_591116,entertainment,"When I saw the original Cavalia nearly four years ago, it was like nothing I had ever experienced.  Odysseo raised the bar to an entirely new level.\n\nOdysseo is staged in an enormous tent (the largest of its kind!) which includes amphitheater type seating, a stage/arena area that is larger than a hockey rink and a video display larger than three IMAX screens.  Impressive.  Well, impressive until you see the horses.\n\nFrom the moment the music started and the lights came up, my breath was taken away.  Horses and performers interacting.  Running, jumping and playing.  Many of the acts featured horses without any sort of restraint, demonstrating the remarkable love and trust between horse and trainer.  At one time, there were 30 horses on the 'stage' area at once.  All moving in synchronized groups of three or four, guided only by their focus on the trainer's cues - words and gentle touches.  Spectacular.\n\nAs if all of that weren't enough, Odysseo dazzled with live musicians and vocalists, dancers, acrobats and trick riders.  So many talented people all under one big top!\n\nIf you are on the fence about seeing either Cavalia or Odysseo (let's be honest, the tickets aren't inexpensive) GO!  You will love every minute, just like I did.\n\n** Just in case you were wondering, not one of the equine performers 'fertilized' the stage area.  Now that is training.  :)",4

We did not find out about these transactions until later that night when we checked our bank accounts.  The club was overcrowded and I'm assuming our cards got mixed up at the bar.  We are in the process of making claims with our banks. \n\nThe DJ we saw prior to Deadmau5 was horrible. He did not engage the crowd and his music selection was uninspired.\n\nOverall, we felt completely ripped off and did not think the club was anything extra special. I wish our night had been better, but the Encore staff was unfriendly and rude  and the club was extremely overpacked. I've been to my fair share of EDM events and I felt this club was less than stellar. \n\nIf anyone does visit the XS, my advice would be to bring cash for drinks since they obviously are not very organized and unconcerned about their guests.",1

Communication was clear, and the fact that even though Ruck was booked out months in advance, he managed to squeeze me in because I was coming in from out of town.

But, that's another story.

They didn't want to speak with anyone, make eye contact, or be of any help what-so-ever. \n\nHey, we're a group of fine lookin' ladies dressed to the nines, here to party and spend some cash on over priced drinks. Why do you keep letting in the old fogies and under dressed? \n\nFinally, after about 5-10 minutes, I caught the eye of a guy ogling my lady lumps and told him we were ready to go in. Thankfully, he obliged without saying a single word. Silence is golden, especially when he's lifting the velvet rope. \n\nThe last girl in with our group claims her Kim Kardashian was grabbed on the way in, by whom, we don't know...but I've got my eyes on the slick haired Napoleon behind the computer. \n\nIn short, the venue is tiny, the bar is overrun and the drinks of course... are overpriced. SHOCKER! They were charging $10 for something slightly larger than a Dixie cup of Champagne, from a bottle of Andre which is about $4.99 a bottle at any local convenience station. \n\nBy the end of the night we were on a first name basis with the staff inside (yeah, we're just a bunch of midwest gals at heart) and were asked to come back again on Sunday night, but passed....there is only so much Rok one can handle in a lifetime; and I'm pretty sure I've met my limit.",1

Ho ho ho hum.  \n\nThe journey quickly deteriorated as we gave up attempting to explain to the kiddies what earthly connection that sharks, dinosaurs, and McDonald's golden arches had  with Christmas, and just began to entertain one another with increasingly sarcastic comments about the questionable d\u00e9cor. Highlight was when we came up slowly over a rise and I had the little ones convinced we were in imminent danger of hurtling over the edge of the earth. At least they were paying attention for a minute, anyway.\n\nLowlight? Actually, it was kind of my fave- an unexpected little surprise at the end. Just when you are getting REALLY irritated because they are directing you away from what is obviously the nearest exit to this yawnfest and forcing you to loop through the whole parking lot to escape, you find there is a method to this madness: the living nativity scene!! Yes, they actually found a bunch of volunteers willing to dress up like Mary, Joseph, and the whole crazy gang, and mill around a makeshift stable! My jaw dropped. Best part- my evil niece gasped, \""OMG! Roll down the window - they're singing!!\"" So we did. And in an uncharacteristic display of restraint and Christmas spirit, I rolled it back up again before they could hear our commentary.\n\nIn summary: this is OK for young children and very tolerant adults, but tired, cheesy and overpriced. Not to mention the speedway isn't close to anybody. Go to the cactus garden at Ethel M. instead. It's beautiful AND free.",1

review_14829,entertainment,"I have to give this place 5-stars. The cheese plates are small and everything is a bit pricey, but I feel it's well worth it. Windows surround the building to the east and north. You can gaze out on Central Avenue and watch passers-by, cars and the light rail. The area suggests Phoenix is coming of age into a more distinctive urban area, rather than its notorious sprawling suburban-esque cityscape. It's in a gentrifying neighborhood that's quickly becoming a more artistic, upscale part of town. They have a lengthy wine and cheese list, the latter offering suggested wine pairings (if you're embarrassed to ask the server.) However, some pairings not suggested may surprise you. The last time I went I was a bit disappointed that my favorite wine they sell (Duck Pond) is only available by the bottle. The cheeses are good, though I've learned from experience to try a small taste of some before taking a larger bite, and I haven't heard of most of them before going here. I enjoy the Nearly Naked Theatre company, which performs at the neighboring Phoenix Art Museum, and always stop in here for a bit of wine and cheese prior to showtime.",4

review_408553,entertainment,Cameron and Robbie are the Tag Team you want for your wedding. They are experienced and do a wonderful job. They handled both our engagement and wedding pictures and We're just blown away with how many excellent pictures we have of these events. Cameron was the point man at our wedding helping coordinate all the other services and DJ'ing our party. All of our friends came back with such positive feedback for what a great time it was. This is an excellent value for a better than fair price and they are a large reason why our special day was such a success.,4
review_591792,entertainment,"One word - unexpected. On the surface a place that tags itself as an \""ultra-dive bar\"" with a hot dog and taco menu, a mechanical bull, beer pong and a pool table has little appeal to me.  But it's also in the Venetian which usually means a snooty bartender will take 9 minutes to make a 13 ingredient, $21 martini. Expensive \""celebrity\"" chef snoots-ville is a Venetian specialty.  However this down to earth little gem is in the Venetian and nothing is infused, crushed or foamed and that suits me just fine.  \n  \nIt was really fun, the music was great, the food was scrumptious and because it is in the Venetian I didn't have to get a hep-c vaccine or up my hobo-stab insurance to brave some sketchy parking lot to get there.  \n      \nFood wise what I would expect from a bar is some crappy frozen, reheated garbage on a plastic plate.  It was on a plastic plate but it was fricking delicious.  Under protest I tried the mini chili cheese hotdogs.  Chili and cheese usually gives me heartburn and because I don't really like chili cheese hotdogs it's not worth it so I avoid them.  But I tried these and they were so good I went back a couple days later and ordered them again, this time armed with a handful of Tums to maximize enjoyment.  And they have soft-serve ice-cream - yum.   \n\nWhat was also unexpected is that admittedly on the surface I appear to be a \""corporate type\"" and I thought this place would be full of \""dirt-bag types.\""  It wasn't.  The crowd ranges the socioeconomic spectrum which makes for a great atmosphere.  There were a few more English dudes there than I would have liked, but I also think there was some weird convention that week. \n   \nThere are a couple of things to be aware of.  There was prolific use of a smoke machine by the DJ - a little The Beach circa 1999.  If you have a couple drinks and then become tempted to get on the mechanical bull, think twice.  I saw a couple of ladies scamper on that thing and it was not hot.  More like awkward dry-humping.  But in those ladies defenses they did appear to think they looked pretty sexy.  Also some of the cocktail waitresses' outfits were not the most becoming (i.e. pudgy stripper).  Maybe someone should have an uncomfortable conversation with a couple of them, but I was told by my male companions they were all hot and I was crazy. \n\nHighly recommend.",4
review_160649,entertainment,"I was excited to stay at New York-New York for the first time ever, as it was one of the more noticeable theme hotels on the strip when I first visited Vegas.  Though, in an amazing location, this hotel it generally average, and some things just plain annoyed me.\nWe booked on Priceline, arriving to find that we were given a room with two queens, as there was no king option available....oh well. Our friends, who had already booked a king suite, were also denied.  I was further annoyed when I saw that my credit card had been charged a $349 deposit for our 3-night stay which would cover \""incidentals\"" and would be otherwise fully refunded.  Well, I have no idea which incidentals they were talking about, as we were refused when we tried to charge our poolside drinks to the room, stating that we had not arranged with the desk to do so.  Further, our room came without a fridge, and they tried to ask for $30 per night to rent one.  We refused, and they still gave us the fridge.  The maid service was fine, except that they called each day at 1:00 PM stating that they could not clean the room because the \""Do Not Disturb\"" sign was still on the door, which is fine, but a little early to decide they cannot clean the room at all. The final annoyance is that we constantly heard the roller coaster from the room, but it wasn't too loud.\nOn the bright side, our room overlooked the pool, which makes for a nice view.  As I said, the location is convenient, and there is a bakery downstairs right at the elevator, perfect for hangover breakfasts.  We checked in and out quickly and easily, and there was never much of a wait at the elevators.\nAll in all, it is not bad, but I'd prefer to pay a bit less and stay somewhere else, or a bit more and stay somewhere nicer.",2

review_232464,entertainment,"In 1985, Dr. Emmett Brown invented time travel, and then in 2005, MSR Properties, with a little inspiration from Dr. Brown's time traveling ways, invented a Time Machine in the form of Hotel Valley Ho.\n\n\""1.21 gigawatts!\""\n\nSo, if you're going to build a time machine with style, why not build it into a hotel? It's a genius idea. And if you still don't believe me when I say that this hotel is a time machine, just take one step inside in lobby. You'll immediately feel the clock reversing back to the 50s. It's a valley vintage twist on Back to the Future. A clever combination of 50s style with a new age flair. \n\nThe 50s decade is my favorite. I totally want to go back and live during that time. But I'd also like to throw in some updated elements, and Hotel Valley Ho does it all. What an excellent time machine!\n\nWhen I'm at the Valley Ho, my concept of time goes out the window. That's how relaxed I am. The rooms are exceptionally comfortable and spacious. Things are simple yet exciting. Time moves slower here.\n\nMatt and I always reserve a basic room - with soft teal, grass green, vibrant orange and snazzy reddish 50s decor and a heavenly cozy yet exceptionally large king bed covered in fun accent pillows. The bathroom contains a large shower and tons of counter space, as two people can get ready together side by side. Plenty of mirrors, spotless clean amenities and it's spacious, too! I've even enjoyed sitting out on the room's balcony while downing a bottle or two of champagne, especially when it's nice outside. For the price, it's a steal. Plus, make sure to check their Web site as there's always a special going on. \n\nYou can even find an updated Scottsdale version of the 1950s pin up girls here, just visit the pool scene and you'll see what I mean. The pool is hopping, well, during the spring/summer months at least. On the weekends they have a DJ, so it gets a little rowdy. They post the OH Pool Bar & Cabana rental info on their Web site too. \n\nWe've also rented a cabana twice, and it's 100% worth it. I stand firm in my belief that it's the best cabana deal around. The drink specials at the pool are fantastic, and the service is superior. With every cabana rental you get your choice of 3 free awesome amenities, like a fruit, veggie or hummus platter, deck of playing cards, Fiji waters... it's a nice bonus. With the refreshing misters, the luxurious lounge chairs, shaded sanctuary and prime pool access, the cabanas are a must do. \n\nIn the future, all hotels will have 5-star worthy customer service... that is if Valley Ho's staff is any indication. In today's world, most hotels have really lost that personalized touch, and they make you feel like one of many. Not Hotel Valley Ho, I always feel important here. From the front desk, to the bartenders, to the room service, it's all top notch. I've been here on multiple staycations have never had a bad experience. \n\nI imagine that the two Hollywood darlings of the fifties, Audrey and Marilyn, would love a place like the Valley Ho. Especially since it encompasses the style and swank of a glamorous 50s hot spot. This hotel romanticizes the 50s by striking a balance between a sophisticated yet youthful atmosphere. Celebrities of the past and present have graced this hotel with their presence, and I expect this trend to continue into the future. It's a special place, and unlike any other hotel I've been to.\n\nAnyone considering a trip to the Valley of the Sun must check out this hotel. If not only for the sole fact that it also doubles as a time machine! \""1.21 gigawatts!\""",4
review_267022,entertainment,"I had my first Vegas dinner here, just to observe the strangeness of the locale.  The Hilton is way off the strip, and the Star Trek Experience is really quite dated.  The service was not that great - the food wasn't anything special.  I ordered a \""Sulu Toss\"" with chicken and shrimp - granted it was a lot of food, and looked interesting - a dome of rice with two huge breadsticks sticking out of it, and the stirfry in a moat around it, while my friend Mary ordered the Hamborger - which was just ok.\n\nThe drinks looked interesting - they had a huge shark-bowl like drink that had 10 shots worth of alcohol in it.  I ordered myself one of their non alcoholic drinks (wit Strawberry, Banana, and Pina Colada) and asked them to put some rum in it.  It was ok.\n\nThe only draw is the Klingon that walks around and mocks you and your dead food.  He definitely seemed bored with his job (possible Elvis impersonator reject?) but nonetheless, you can get your picture taken with him.",2
review_403711,entertainment,"This is a review of this Hard Rock as a concert venue only. \n\nHaving not been to this location previously - I downloaded directions from the Hard Rock's website. The parking situation sounded tricky - and it was. The fact that the directions provided were incorrect didn't help. Parking for the venue is in the parking garage for the Showcase Mall - and costs 3.00 (cash only) to boot. Paying for parking is unheard of on The Strip! \n\nOK - so once we find the parking lot, pay and park - the elevator dumps you out on a side street. About a block away from the entrance. We started walking toward Las Vegas Blvd. and slowly realized that all these people waiting in line were waiting to get into the venue. This is where it gets silly. \n\nIn order to get into the concert venue one needs to:\n1. Wait outside in line in the desert heat.\n2. Once you get past the first staggered security point - you're released by the security guard to walk down the public sidewalk (with everyone else that just happens to be strolling the strip unimpeded) to the entrance to the Hard Rock Store. You walk through the store - right through all the shoppers to three flights of steep stairs. All the while, there is nothing to keep random people that haven't waited in line from joining your group on the way (as one girl did - slipping into our group right behind us). So, lesson number one - only suckers wait in line...\n3. It took about 45 minutes total to get into the venue - and we arrived at posted start time. Luckily, the show started late so we didn't miss any of the show.\n\nOnce we got inside, the venue actually wasn't bad. The sound was decent and although the place holds 1100 people - it still manages to feel intimate. In keeping with Hard Rock tradition - the artifacts and historical exhibits were well done and cool. Drinks are at Strip club price - $16.00 a round for a bourbon & coke and a Miller Light.\n\nAll I can say is, I've been a musician and an avid rock show attendee for three decades now - and I'm sorry - but it's obvious to me that they built the venue with no consideration as to how a large audience would actually access the performance space on the 3rd floor. This major planning fail kind of set the tone for the night unfortunately...\n\nUPDATE: I received a few very nice messages from Hard Rock management - and they'll be working to address the entrance issues and are hoping to make this location into a premiere Las Vegas music venue.  I can't wait to see what they can work out.",1

review_238504,entertainment,"On April 6, 2009, I headed out to Las Vegas for a short springtime vacation.  I was pleasantly surprised to learn that the Bellagio Gallery of Fine Art was showcasing my all-time favorite artist, Roy Lichtenstein.  The exhibit, titled Classic Contemporary: Lichtenstein, Warhol and Friends consisted of around 10-15 pieces, mostly large-scale sculptures and works on paper; and aims to portray the relationships between Abstract Expressionism, Pop Art and minimalism. \n\nUpon entering the gallery, I was under the impression that I would begin an hour-long excursion into Pop Art heaven.  The gallery is much, much smaller than I had expected (as was the exhibit).  The open space is suitable for large-scale pieces, but it had an almost empty, loner feel to it.  I was disappointed to learn that there were only two Lichtenstein pieces, both of which did not fit into the Pop Art category and were much more suitable candidates for minimalism.  His piece called \""The Mirror\"" uses uses the simple concept of mirrors reflecting upon one another, composed of dwindling dots and lines until the last reflection is reduced to a tiny snapshot of the original.  \n\nAlthough the gallery at the Bellagio is usually filled with 19th and 20th century masterpieces, they could've done a bit more to open up the world of Abstract Expressionism to visitors.  While these artists are not typically what most tourists would expect to see, they were definitely not given the due credit they deserve at the Bellagio.  That being said, it was definitely not worth the $15 I paid for admission.",1

The amount of water they use is truly a testament to the lavishness (and to be honest, wastefulness) that is Vegas.\n\nThe acts were all great. I'm always happy to see a bunch of acrobatic dives. Synchronized swimming is all the more impressive because of the sheer number of swimmers who have to synchronize.\n\nOne the ship-trapeze act, the artist fell into the water. They recovered nicely. The artist swam up and \""collapsed\"" on the stage until the act was over.

review_453874,entertainment,"OH.EM.GEE. COMFYSOFASOHYESCOMFYCOMFY!\n\nIn non-excited-Jen speak, that translates as \""Oh my, the standard 'sofa seats' in this cinema are really quite comfy. In fact, some of the comfiest I've sat in. The added perk of the foot stools was quite a pleasing addition.'\n\nThe Dominion Cinema, nestled in the up-market Morningside, is an up-market cinema. I think standard ticket prices are \u00a310. But considering the Odeon now charge \u00a38.80 for a standard cinema ticket, I would more than happily pay the extra \u00a31.20 for comfort you can't put a price on.\n\nMy friend and I came here to watch 'Water for Elephants' on the larger screen. It really is quite a huge room, and the screen was really far away from all the seats but this wasn't a problem. We went slap bang in the middle on a two-seater sofa (with footstools) and only at the end of the movie, when we turned around, did we realise there are individual sofa seats, like giant comfy desk chairs, behind on the area above. Oh well, date night it was!\n\nHave I mentioned that the sofas are comfy? Like whoa. These are comfier than my sofas at home (my friend concurred with this statement). The whole set up was perfect. And they weren't purpose built row-upon-row of comfy sofas all in one unit. No. Stand alone leather sofas, with stand alone foot stools and stand alone tables.

review_509232,entertainment,"I hadn't been in Cricket Arena - I mean Bojangles Coliseum  - since the old ECHL Checkers played their home games there.  I went to a graduation ceremony there tonight and remembered how much I disliked this building.  First, the traffic backs up dangerously from Independence onto 277 coming in from uptown.  Second, you have no option but to pay for parking, and sometimes will have to walk the equivalent of 4 or 5 uptown blocks from the car to the building.  I never pay to park uptown and never walk more than 3 blocks.  The light rail and number of routes in mean traffic is a lot less uptown too.\n\nIt only gets worse inside the building.  The building can hold around 10,000 people, but it is cramped.  The concourses are narrow.  The restrooms are small and have odd cement overhangs above the urinals.  That's not good for someone who is 6'4\"".   There also isn't any warm water - just facets marked \""c\"" for cold. The seats are wooden - yes wooden.  They are very small and very uncomfortable.  Metal folding chairs are better than these.  My back is always stiff when I leave.    There is more room between airline seats.  One of the only reasons I'm giving this venue two stars is that seats have a nice slope to them  This makes for a great view of hockey even if you're only a few rows up, but the seats are so uncomfortable, that two stars is all I can give.\n\nLittle did we know that when the Checkers moved uptown it was part of a larger effort to attract an AHL team - and it worked.  The Checkers (a completely different team than the two teams that previously played in this building) now draw close to 13000 people several times a year, which is 3000 more than Bojangles can hold for hockey.  I'm so happy they moved uptown - it is so much more accessible and comfortable.  I was thinking about coming to a Carolina Speed indoor football game but I won't after being back in this building.

When we went to the Viva Las Vegas Chapel, I just got a good feeling. People were very nice, took lots of time to walk us around the venue, answer questions, etc. I loved that guests could take their own photos as long as they didn't leave their seat, I could have a flower girl (& she wouldn't be required to then pick up all her petals, like some venues), & I wouldn't be confined to a very strict 15 minute window like other chapels where we literally saw a line of weddings, waiting for their 15 minutes of time, before being ushered into another room to make way for the next couple. \n\nWe combined the garden chapel with the Viva Las Vegas w/ Limo Elvis package. I special ordered a bigger bouquet for myself, kept the 3 rose bouquet (& ordered an additional one) for my 2 bridesmaids, a Boutonniere for my dad, and petals for my flower girl. All the flowers looked great! The limo driver was great to work with. He picked us up & dropped us off at our hotel (The Cosmopolitan) with no problems.\n\nWhen we arrived at the chapel, they had everything ready, did a quick walk through with us and our small wedding party, then put us in a room while our guests were seated. The ceremony was sweet, but still fun. Our Elvis was great (my grandma still talks about how great he was & she originally did not like the thought of us having Elvis perform our wedding). & afterwards they gave us great instruction on how to obtain our official marriage certificate. \n\nThe webstream of our wedding was GREAT!  I have such a big family (that we didn't invite) & they LOVED being able to watch at home and I loved knowing that they were watching. \n\nOur photos turned out great ! But they are pretty pricey, in my opinion. I get that's just how it goes for wedding photos. $19-$29 per photo just to download it (not to have a print). You have a year after your wedding date to purchase them, though. So if you can't afford them right away, you can get them later. \n\nMy only complaint is that the marquee wasn't working properly on our day so we didn't get to see our name in lights. I get that stuff happens & it didn't ruin our day, but I had been looking forward to that. They photo shopped it into a photo for us, but it's not really the same. \n\nThe planning of our day over the phone was really easy, & when we checked in with them the day before, nothing had been missed. Our wedding day went seamless, we didn't feel rushed, we felt taken care of. I'd definitely recommend them!",4

review_297450,entertainment,"I'd like to give Sundance a higher rating, I really would. There's so much to like about it (movie selections, decor, semi-gourmet concessions, etc), and it's an honor for Madison that it was selected for one of only 2 Sundance theaters in the country (the other one's in SF). But man, they really sodomize you with the ticket prices. This isn't New York City, or even Milwaukee, and I'm surprised and a little disappointed that the Sundance people haven't figured out by now the reason for their lackluster sales. Or at least, that they haven't done anything about it.",2
review_365853,entertainment,"All I have to say is WOW. I think XS is probably one of the best clubs in Vegas. I've always gone to Marquee in the past, just cuz of all the hype. But I'd have to echo some other yelpers, XS is definitely better than Marquee, in my opinion. \n\nFirst of all, I really like the layout. It's one level, no stairs like Marquee. I also love their patio. I love how the pool is a circle and tables are wrapped around it. There's also a huge screen so you can see the DJ spinning from outside. The dance floor was jammed packed so it was nice to be outdoors and not sweating bullets inside. \n\nWe met some really cool Greek Canadians and hung out with them at their table. However, this club is predominantly Asian. I didn't know that going in. Although I'm Asian, I prefer a more diverse crowd. I guess we lucked out when we found these Greek Canadians. \n\nThe only complaint I have is the bouncers in line. This short Filipino was having a power trip. My girlfriend allegedly knocked down one of the ropes in line. He stomped over and literally yelled at her for knocking it down and didn't pick it up. She was so scared and apologized and said it was an accident, she didn't even see it. He made her walk ALL the way back in the line and walked back into our spot in line for entry. Are you kidding me?! We didn't make a scene cuz we didn't want to get kicked out before even heading inside. I'm just glad it didn't ruin our fabulous night.",3
review_148109,entertainment,"As with most of my Hotel Casino reviews I haven't stayed at the Silverton Lodge so this is reviewing everything except the rooms division.\n\nI love the Silverton. It has a couple of decent restaurants, the inside is very sleek and classy and reminds me alot of The M Casino. And according to Anthony M. Twin Creeks has one of the best bourbon selections in town.\nAlthough, for me, its the most dangerous place in all of Vegas. Let me explain why.\n\nOne of the best kept secrets in Vegas is on Thursday nights. The Silverton has a makeshift \""pub crawl\"" inside the Casino at it's many bars.\nHere's the kicker...Drinks...not just beers...but Drinks, ALL DRINKS, are $1 you-call-it for an hour at each of the 4 bars for 1 hour each. That means ANY drink is $1 for 4 hours.\n\nI'll stop for a minute and let you reflect on that..................\nOK, I think everyone can now see where the danger comes in (As small as the casino is I have gotten lost and not been able to find the 4th bar by the time its turn came.\n\nOn top of all of that you add in:\nLive entertainment\nThe Mermaid Aquarium\na Great food court\nSuper Friendly staff\n$5 single deck blackjack\n&.....&......&.....A Bass Pro Shop....where I can stumble in and drunkenly hit golf balls on the digital shot analyzer, then stumble upstairs and debate the merits of purchasing a cross bow, a rifle or a tazer, and afterwards, an elevator ride past a giant riverscaped fish tank just calling for me to dive in.\n\nThis place has more potential for mischief than a frat party held at a petting zoo.",4
review_179728,entertainment,"I have gone to Tao every time I've gone to Vegas so far (which isn't much, but still). It's a fairly large club but it gets crowded really fast. I took away a star because of how crowded it gets...but that just means it's the place to be, right? I love the feel of the place...oh, and I must agree with what Chris P. said about giving a star for the girls in bathtubs. There are half-naked ladies covered in flower petals in bathtubs. Ooh lala! \n\nI usually try to go in through the guestlist with enough girls...you want AT LEAST the same number of guys as girls...the more girls the better. Last time I had more guys in our group, but somewhere in line I found some lovely ladies who offered to help us get in by changing our girl-guy ratio 1:1. I'm usually out of there before I can get trampled by the thousands of people pushing and shoving their way around...plus, standing, walking and dancing in 5-inch heels certainly makes its mark on my feet by that time, anyway. Tao Beach is nice because it's on the roof...it is closed when the weather isn't ideal, but it's usually open if you go during the spring, summer, or fall.",3

review_75434,entertainment,"I would love to see the city of Pittsburgh support theater with more dedication and passion. Sure, lots of Yinzers have annual subscriptions to the Benedum Center to catch The Lion King or Wicked when it comes to town. But, what about the smaller, unknown plays that need some support? We're not just talking about watching shows here, we're talking about supporting the arts, encouraging aspiring playwrights and even lesser known seasoned playwrights to bring their works here. You may not be able to brag to your co-workers the next day like you did when you saw Rent, but you might be exposed to the next great play.\n\nI've been to City Theatre a number of times this past year thanks to a friend's annual subscription. I've watched good shows, boring shows, and some that I really loved. I'm a big fan of good old dialogue - the kind that makes you really know a character, whether you like them or not, you are intrigued by their story. I've seen some good actors on the stage, a few were/are still students at nearby Carnegie Mellon's Musical Theater or Acting programs. Watching a play in its beginning stages is intriguing, especially when you see the actors nail the character right on spot. I love it. \n\nBut what finally encouraged me to write this review was last night's show \""Speak American\"". It was the first showing for a story that probably hits home for many locals. The setting is Pittsburgh in 1904, where some steel mill immigrants workers were learning English from a curious and passionate teacher. The play explores each character, where they came from, what their dreams are, and the struggles that they face. \n\nLike I said, I would imagine this story to intrigue the locals, but I don't even know if people know (or care) that this show is playing. Again, it was opening night and the theater was maybe 60-70% full. I know it was a Thursday evening, so I'm hoping that the weekend will see better attendance. But, either way, the local interest needs to increase so that this local gem can continue to bring good shows. This is a great time to check out City Theatre if you haven't already - ticket prices are usually pretty fair, and if you call the box office they can always offer student prices, buy one get ones, etc. \n\nAlso, I'd love to see a younger generation in the audience too, because usually when I go I am one of the youngest people there by a long shot... and I'm not that young.",3
review_98079,entertainment,"It sounded like fun but fell a little short of expectations.\nLiving social sponsored the cruise. $60 a person. They had lots of friendly staff on hand to check everyone in. \nWe heard the boat was air condioned but noticed only the bottom half of this double decker was sealed in for such. Just like Titanic, we knew only half the passengers were going to make it. So we got as close to the front of the line as possible. We made it inside and grabbed a couple seats. The poor people opposite us had seats but couldn't sit down because plastic stacking chairs were stored there. They shouldn't use precious AC space for storage!\nSoon after we shoved off they opened the front doors and hot, 107 degree air blasted through the cabin. Everyone was complaining but the crew said they had to circulate fresh air through because of the sterno candles used to keep the buffet food warm. There was nothing fresh about that air! \nWe had punch cards, wrist bands, and tickets for drinks and food control. God forbid someone got an extra cup of soda. The food was good but not $60 a person good. \nThe lake and scenery was beautiful. \nAfter dinner was music from a steel drum band and dancing. But it was only one guy on one steel drum playing with a cassette. And I don't know where there was a dance floor because it was packed like sardines. I think there was 4 square feet total.\nAnywho, It killed a couple hours and was an experience when you'r sick of the dry desert. You can try it if you're bored and don't mind parting with your money. I passed someone dismbarking and they asked if it was worth it. I said, \""Meh. I've had better.\""",1

review_375727,entertainment,"We visited the Aria back in 2012 and wanted a re visit, we spend the first part of our stay in Vegas at the Cosmopolitan next door but due to the overwhelming amount of Hotels in Las Vegas we decided that we wanted to spend it in two hotels so the Aria was our second choice.\n\nWe arrived around 6pm and there was no queue at the Reception so we was checked in right away, we had also received a complimentary upgrade to a Strip/City View, i had asked for a high floor and the highest they could put us was the 22nd, the hotel did not seem full so I'm not sure why they couldnt have put us on a higher floor but the 22nd was great!! \n\nWe arrived into our room and the music on the TV came on automatically, and the blackout curtains begin to open to show you the view, a really cool idea! I also loved the remote controlled device where you could change the lighting,the TV,the automatic curtains and other parts of the room, the bed was also very comfortable, parts of the room was looking a bit dated from the bedside cabinets and wardrobes, but apart from that a really nice room with a great view of the Aria and parts of the Las Vegas Strip.\n\nWhat i love about this Hotel though is the chilled out vibe,everywhere seems really relaxed including all of the employees who work at the Aria.\n\nThe pool area is also really nice and one of the main reasons why we came back, we love the pool areas alot and loved the chilled out music begging played from the speakers, all the pool attendants was really friendly and couldnt do enough to help, though drink prices are really expensive around the pool, we paid $17 for two beers which was a bit crazy but this can be expected from the Pool bars in Vegas.\n\nWe had a superb stay in the Aria and we look forward to staying there again in the near future.",3

There's stupid steps all over them and people - myself included - are forever drunkenly tripping up whilst trying to pull out some shapes.  \nThe drinks are ridiculously priced and they have pathetic deals on like their bucket thing which is just a few shots of vodka and some fruit juice for \u00a37!!

review_165045,entertainment,"Well, having been to Vegas several times and having stayed at a few different hotels I decided to share my experiences at each hotel both the good and the bad.\n\nCheck-in: Despite a long line it moved VERY quickly and everything was in order when I did check into my room. I did arrive an hour earlier than their regular check-in time but, believe me when I say being nice to the person at the front desk paid off this time around. I was able to get to the room early and actually got an upgrade for a small fee ($40).\n\nRoom: I was suppose to stay in the West Wing but, I got upgraded to the Celebrity Suite. I almost never felt like leaving my room the second I stepped foot inside. The whirlpool tub was just another added bonus.\n\nFood: A wide selection from fine dining to casual places like the Rainforest Cafe all provided a totally different experience each strictly distinct from food to decor. The one thing in common was the level of good service provided in each restaurant.\n\nPool: The Lazy River is as far as I got because I didn't need to go any further. Rent a tube and order an adult beverage and the river does the rest. I was there for roughly 2 1/2 - 3 hours without even noticing the time.\n\nShows: I don't do too much in the way of clubs while I'm in Vegas rather I enjoy the wide selection of shows that Vegas provides. I saw KA which I enjoyed a lot, not as good as \""O\"" when I went to see it at the Bellagio but KA was unique and pleasing in it's own way.\n\nGaming: Easy to find a table as well as slots. The poker room had a decent sized wait but, I just waited at the sports book for my turn to come up. After losing around $400 I made way to my luckier spots Bally's and the Paris casino's.\n\nCheck-out: I actually found it hard to leave on my scheduled checkout date so I stayed an extra night. When I finally did make my way to the front desk check-out went smoothly and quickly.\n\nI would stay here just based on the amenities and service. It's not too flashy but, it's location and service are always worth staying at the MGM.",3

Nuggets b-ball game.  There's a couple giant screen TVs (over 100 inches) and then the place is surrounded by HD flat screens.  They also serve 100 ounce 30 dollar beers (not sure what flavors) and the bring them out in these really cool bong looking containers, not to mention 4-7 happy hour with 2 for 1s.  The only draw back to that is that you have to go up to bar to be able to get the drink special, kind of lame....\n\nBig, juicy burgers, and a hot-naughty wait staff, lots of TVs, 2 for 1s... if there's a game you're looking for, come and check out this place, it's great for the 'typical guy guy'.",2

Oshea's is now located inside the Quad and it was poppin' every night in there! They have a few cheap tables, a bar and beer pong! I definitely suggest stopping in here. \n\nHaving Hash House A Go Go and Fat Tuesday inside the hotel was an added bonus. Located right in the middle of the strip so location alone deserves 5 stars. They're building a new sort of ferris wheel, which is awesome!\n\nWe got the luv tub room, which was incredibly spacious with a huge space for getting dressed/doing makeup which was my favorite part of the room! The shower was small, but besides that no complaints. The tub on the other hand looked super gross....we didn't even bother going in there considering I didn't wanna come home with any diseases. The bed was suprisingly super comfortable. This was one of the few times I slept like a baby both nights in Vegas. The mirror above the bed was a nice touch.\n\nOur friends' deluxe room was a bit of a disappointment however. It was on the smaller side, with stains on their bedding. It wasn't horrible for the price they paid, but definitely not a place you wanna stay, chill and pre drink in.\n\nCheck out process on the TV was super easy and convenient. \n\nParking is kind of a nightmare but we valeted when we got in Friday and just picked it up Sunday morning. \n\nOverall...A-OK hotel that I will definitely consider in the near future when they are further along with their renovation.",2

review_134479,entertainment,"When I was staying in the Mirage, I'd look out my window and watch the marquee screen on the Casino Royale building and decided to try it out because of the $50 promotion offer for new club members advertised on the marquee screen. I decided to give it a try since it was $50 free slot play and I couldn't resist free play even when your down on your luck. \n\nThe offer was a total bust and I felt cheated but at least I got to experience what old school Vegas was like on the newly transformed strip and I never even bothered walking inside the casino whenever I would walk to Wynn and Mirage. Clientele can be trashy and trendy and the casino feels so alive and the drinks here are dirt cheap compared to the bigger casinos. \n\nFood Court was great to have inside the Casino Royale despite most of the restaurants on the strip being overpriced and they even have a Denny's open 24/7.",2
review_554782,entertainment,"3.5 Stars  :)\n\nI had a lot of fun at a Sunday night show here. The crowd was a good size and mostly enjoying the show. The three comedians they booked were hilarious and the host was ok. You can tell by the comedy clips they show while you wait (which was a nice touch) that they book some very talented entertainers. \n\nThe venue had a few snags, though. We were seated very close to the stage, which was awesome, but my husband and I were placed exactly in line with one another, his chair directly behind mine. I didn't want to talk during the show or anything, but on our anniversary night it would have been nice to be able to hold hands. The arrangement of chairs kind of forced that sort of seating for some, but it seemed like the chairs were arranged around unnecessarily big tables. All anyone had to put on them was a cocktail. And only one cocktail. GIven the limited amount of time between seating and the show, and the sardine-pack seating, that was the only cocktail I got. At least, I suppose, there was no 2 drink minimum. And the show was funny enough that I didn't need another to help me laugh. \n\nWe had the Tropicana player's club card which allows 2-for-1 tickets to the Laugh Factory. That made it a great deal.\n\nI really enjoyed myself and am glad we went here. Despite the couple snags, I would recommend going.",2
review_329044,entertainment,"Now I write this review even though I havent been to Jet since NYEve weekend, and I have heard things have changed and been upgraded since then. But back then, I thought that Jet was just an average Vegas spot. Not very big and too many guys in the spot. Plus, with the setup of the bars, its just tough access to drinks without tons of people trying to walk past and around you. if your up in the VIP section overlooking the dancefloor, things are a little better because you have a location not in the masses. The different rooms with providing different musical choice is cool, but the times Ive been there, Ive never really liked the house DJ's they've had in the \""techno/house/electronica\"" room. But I'll definitely check it out again next time I'm there to see if its improved any.",2
review_478405,entertainment,"So first off, this place kicks Verizon Wireless Amphitheater's ass!  It's a lot smaller in terms of capacity but it is so much easier to get into and out of, easier to move around, easier to get a beer and go to the bathroom, and just overall better in every sense of the word.  It's also right in the middle of the NC Music Factory so you can come early, get something to eat, and head on in when you're ready.  \n\nI've been here for a few shows, most recently Ben Folds Five a few weeks ago.  I've never had a bad experience here.  The lawn is good sized and it's on a nice incline so you can see over the heads of the folks in front of you.  The seats in the front part are pretty well spaced out and it's not hard to get in and out of the rows.  And there is a walkway in between the lawn and the seats that is convenient to get to and allows you to hit up the concessions and get back very easily.\n\nOne thing to note, there are no covered seats so you are at the mercy of the weather!  \n\nThis place is very well-designed and one of the best places in Charlotte to see a show!",4

I asked for water cups because I don't like myself or my kids to drink sugar drinks. They said they don't give any out.

review_531010,entertainment,"My boyfriend and I went with another couple and went through all three haunted houses. The Circus Clown themed house was fun and the perfect amount of scary to ease you into it. The Vampyre Castle was really well done (I love Vampires) and was more intense than the Circus Clown house. \nNow for the main attraction: The Gates of Hell... I was already announcing to the group that I don't want to go through this house, I'm good with the other two. Of course I was convinced into going and everything would be fine. I won't give away any of the haunts inside but I will say I had to say the \""safe\"" word because I couldn't take it anymore. I've read all of these negative comments and it seems like I had the same experience as the others but I was expecting it. It is made extremely clear prior to you entering the house that you will be abused psychologically, physically, and not everyone can handle it. Even being the only one out of my group who caved and opted out I still think that this Trilogy is awesome! They do their jobs very well. Not everyone can handle the R rated house (me being one of them) but I expected everything that happened to happen.\nAll in all, if you are up for the scare of your life then go!!! Yes they touch you but eventually they have to stop... It's a great time!",4

review_31905,entertainment,Rustler's Rooste is a good place to go once at least once because of the novelty of being a restaurant on the top of a mountain. The view is beautiful. It is a neat place. I mean they have a bull out front at the entrance. Once you get in there is a slide or stairs. You can choose which you prefer to get down to the first level. They have live bands. They are usually older bands playing country music. They start you off with bread and it is delicious. The food on the other hand was decent but maybe not worth the price. It's fun to try once but the novelty quickly wears off. Parking somewhat sucks. Hope you don't have a hard type getting up stairs because you have to go up about 3 stories of stairs just to get from the parking to the restaurant.,2
review_24614,entertainment,DONT COME HERE! Groupon users beware! I saw a sweet deal on groupon (15$ for four people for open skate) that was only a sweet deal online. The skates were so worn our feet had bruises on them afterwards. The lady who helped us with our skate size gave us all a size up even when we asked for a smaller size! It was so uncomfortable and very difficult to skate it in. As we managed to make the best of it  but could not bare we headed off the ice and a hockey coach saw our shoes were to big and mentioned next time we should get smaller skates on our way out. We also got off the ice because they rushed us off by starting to cleaning the ice 20 minutes before our time was up. Oh yeah It's also very hidden and hard to find.,0

review_129843,entertainment,"Last fall we decided to go to ESPN Zone to watch a Monday Night Football game.  Our team was on MNF and we figured this would be the perfect place to watch the game.\n\nDespite being half empty, the ESPN Zone had a policy in effect requiring each table to order a certain dollar amount of food/drinks per hour.  The host and server were both pretty rude about informing us of this policy.  It almost felt like we were being accused of being cheapskates who wouldn't order enough food/alcohol.  Weird?\n\nThe food was overpriced, even by Las Vegas Strip standards.  Stanard bar food, just like TGI Fridays.  \n\nThe minimum was sort of insulting considering how empty the place was - as was the service (which was poor).

review_424815,entertainment,"As much as I'd like to award Heinz Hall 5 stars, I just can't bring myself to do it.  I visited with some friends this past Sat. for CMU night at the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra (PSO).  This was the third time that I'd seen a PSO concert here, and every time, they've been amazing.  We have a truly world-class orchestra here in PGH, so if you've never seen them perform, I'd highly recommend it.  If this review were on the PSO itself, they would definitely earn 5+ stars.\n\nI don't usually do these, but I think this review calls for a pro/con format:\n\nPros:\n\n1.) Beautiful interior decorations: The chandeliers, columns, and domed ceilings are breathtaking.  The ivory and red color combination also screams \""classy,\"" which is perfect for a symphony venue.\n\n2.) The courtyard: If you have time during intermission or before/after the show, be sure to check out the courtyard to the right of the front entrance.  Last Sat. was the first time I'd visited it, and there's a cool water fountain and some tables to sit and relax at, if you're lucky enough to snag one.\n\n3.) The PSO: See above.  Unlike the Benedum and Byham, which are owned by the PGH Cultural Trust, the PSO owns Heinz Hall, so most of what plays here are their symphonies.  In fact, I've never personally viewed any other type of programming here--though I suppose it must exist to some extent.\n\nCons:\n\n1.) Seat pitch: I hate to say this, but expect to be cramped and uncomfortable during the show--at least, if you're sitting on the second level balcony!  There is only about 2' of room between rows, which was barely enough for me to stuff my legs in--and I'm an average height woman!  I assume the concert hall was designed this way to maximize seating, but they missed the mark on the comfort/capacity balance.  Ladies, if there are people sitting on either side of you, I'd suggest putting your purse under your seat.  Although it's out of sight, it beats having it between your feet the entire time!\n\nEDIT: Seat pitch isn't an issue on the orchestra level, though I can't speak for the first floor balcony.  I recommend spending a bit more cash to sit on one of these levels and avoid having cramped legs the entire show.\n\n2.) Bathrooms: This may just be me, but it seems that there's less capacity in the women's bathrooms than there is in the Benedum, which makes for longer lines during intermission.  If you need to use them at this time, I strongly suggest sneaking out when everyone's still applauding to skip the line!\n\nBetween the excellence of the PSO and the stunning beauty of the interior, I agree that the strengths of Heinz Hall far outweigh its weaknesses, but being cramped and uncomfortable during concerts detracts from the experience, sadly.  I'd highly recommend paying a visit if you enjoy classical music--or if you're a visitor to town and the PSO is playing.  4.5 stars.",3
review_581139,entertainment,"Light! It definitely is the Light of Vegas!  I had high expectations for this club given the fact it was created by Cirque du Soleil and had inputs from Swedish House Mafia's manager.  Not only were my expectations met but made me realize what a club should be  They established themselves as the most technologically advanced, creative, and club-goer-centric venue in the entire Vegas, and does it deliver.\n\nThe entrance seems like something that should be on a Daft Punk music video, with a cascade of colorful lights that provide an illusion of infinite lights.  As you enter the club, you are immersed by 4 huge screens that dominant the entire club and can be seen from any view.  Located behind the DJ but encompassing the entire front wall, the 2 LED screens and 2 projection screens exemplify the essence that is Light.  Throughout the night,  the music is accompanied by numerous Cirque du Soleil performers acrobat ingabove the club and bouncing around and behind use the 2 projection walls.  There will never be a moment of dullness or time to breath at this club because everything around you is a spectacle.\n\nWhat truly brings this club together is the massive DJ lineup from the major hitters like Axwell, Alesso, Ingrosso, Skrillex to the new joiners to music - Zedd, Baauer, Otto Knows, Matt Zo, and more.  With the latest in sound systems even better than those of Funktion 1's, this club literally can be called the best in Vegas if not in the world.\n\nFriendly customer service from inside the club (don't let the door people or line workers mess up your impression of the club), extensive bars (so no line), Cirque Du Soleil theatrical performers, insane sound system, best DJ lineup in Vegas, and latest and largest LED technology in Vegas, this club is definitely not one to miss.

review_297351,entertainment,"Being amongst the funemployed, the matinee deals at local cinemas are somewhat of a regular occurrence for me.  Today, my movie crew graced the not so Regal Phillips Place \""Stadium\"" 10.\nOkay, it is a quaint little theater for those that had a few cabernet sauvignons at Dean and Deluca and wanted to stroll down to see one of maybe five or six movies that have semi-recently come out.  But for those of us that want the latest in movie experiences, they come up amazingly short.  \nFor starters, the matinees are $7.50 compared to $5.00 at most other, better appointed theaters.  You have your standard overpriced soda, popcorn, and candy deals.  Those are expected.\nBy definition, it IS stadium seating in the theaters.

review_458573,entertainment,"My first impression - \""Is this a strip club?\"" The first thing I saw when I walked in Surrender was a bunch of stripper poles and gogo dancers dancing with dollar bills in their panties. Was totally NOT expecting that! \n\nI'm not sure what it is but this club was completely dead on a Saturday night. The promoters told me it would be crowded so they even convinced me to buy presale for my bf, even though when we showed up it was comped admission for both guys and girls and there was absolutely NO line at midnight.\n\nAfter checking out Light, the atmosphere at Surrender was definitely different. They played more hip hop than anything. Also, the LED wall and sound system was unimpressive compared to Light. I did like that there was more room to dance and the outdoor area provided a nice escape when my feet started hurting. They even have blackjack tables in the outdoor area for those who want to continue gambling in the club. I also loved that they gave out the colored LED tube thingys.

review_527172,entertainment,"Went here for lunch.  The atmosphere is cool, like eating at the Crypt Keeper's living room, except that he broke down and bought a flat screen TV to catch the latest football game in HD.  Everything except the breakfast menu is monster/horror themed, and the breakfast menu on Sundays runs until 2 P.M., a nice perk for those that are late risers.  Prices for breakfast will run around the 7-8 dollar range, unless you get steak and eggs, which is $14.  \n\nWe ordered a myriad of dishes, and started with the Children of the Corn fritters.  They were probably the best part of my meal.  They were kind of like a cross between a falafel and a hush puppy, filled with corn and a sweet potato batter, deep fried, and coated with a garlic sauce.  I had the Sasquatch (veggie sandwich), which was decent, and made with fresh veggies, but it was a little bland.  Also, the sandwich bread was cut unevenly so that the lower half was very thin, which made the bottom half of the sandwich very soggy as the juices from the veggies seeped into the bread.  As a result I had to turn the sandwich upside down to eat it.  I had a bite of the breakfast burrito ($8), which was OK, but nothing too special.  It was basically a diner-style breakfast plate with eggs, potato, bacon, wrapped in a tortilla.  For half the price, I could get an excellent breakfast burrito, at say, Los Favoritos.  We had a little tyke in our group and she had a chicken fingers basket, which came in a huge portion, almost like an adult size portion!  All our meals came with freshly made chips, which were huge slices of potato, light and crispy.\n\nThe outdoor patio looks nice and shaded, and they allow dogs on the patio!  It's more of a regular restaurant feel outside, so if you want the creepy cool monster experience, eat indoors.  I'd say for the most part, go here for the atmosphere more than for the food, unless you want to get a few appetizers to share.\n\nAnother thing to note (Which may be self-evident), if your tyke doesn't like scary movies or haunted houses, it's perhaps best not to take him or her here for the indoor part of the restaurant.  We were seated next to the animatronic Grudge monster (A giant troll-like monster with sharp pointy teeth!) and the 5 year old in our group was really freaked out by it and kept repeating that she was scared and never wanted to eat here again. : p",2

review_292592,entertainment,"Disappointing. I went on a Friday night (12/17/10) and only about 60% of the lights were on because of the rain. Sure it rarely rains in Vegas, but they should have been smart enough to know that water and electricity don't work well together and planned for a situation like that. The lights that were working were ok, but nothing out of the ordinary. Paying $15 for this debacle was way too much.
