review_265607,drinks,"First off it seems like they are always changing there staff when I come in. We try to get to know the bartender and stuff,but gets hard. Lol but I love Nina the waitress,she's the best. Unfortunately  she is leaving :(  I love the music they play here! Good happy hour too! Come by play some pool with your friends and drink a nice brew on tap!:)",3
review_560563,drinks,"When this place was first opened, I wrote it off... It seemed a little bland at first, despite a nice blue paintjob....and the crowd just was generally older... Not really my scene.\n\nThen, some fellow Yelpers had a meetup here prior to a movie at Fountain Park and I was pleasantly surprised to see that this set-up was pretty decent. I have since returned numerous times and it's unexpected favourite.\n\nDrinks can be a little above average price but affordable, I think the Fountain's best feature is the ambiance. If you have had a long day and you'd like to unwind with a nice cold drink, this is the place to be. A very nice place where there isn't insanely loud music and you can actually talk. It also doubles as a great place to hang out prior to movies.\n\nOn to the food, I LOVE their fries... So big and crispy and it comes in a pot... My friends are a fan of its fruit ciders. For me, I always go for their ginger beer.",3
review_554692,drinks,"Stopped by this liitle gem tonight after a good meal at Pellinis next door.  Oh me, oh my, I think I just ate the best cupcake of my life......chocolate with salted carmel frosting.....DELISH.  The price was quite reasonable also at $2.50.  This place is WAY better than Sprinkles.   Cant wait to go back and try the cake bites.",4
review_414588,drinks,"This place is reasonably inexpensive, with good drink specials, but the food is nothing more than slightly below average bar food (with a decent but unimpressively tasting pizza menu).    It's about what you'd expect, and earns a solid \""Meh\"" rating from this reviewer.",1
review_497906,drinks,"good Starbucks, busy because it's inside the outlet mall. (i should know, i work in a Starbucks inside a mall)\ni had a very light lunch, which was just the egg salad sandwich and iced caramel macchiato. \ngood job partners!",3
review_309862,drinks,"Alright this is the deal of deals, 2.75 for students and Im not sure if its a quarter more or not, but less 4 dollars. half an ice cream cookie sandwiches, trust me its enough.  \n\nIts a great pick me up for something sweet on mill\n\nCookies are made their along with the good ice cream, and if your not into that they have italian ice.\n\nPlace is small, but is packed with flavor, and smells like fresh cookies.\n\nRecommendation: If you love cookies made into sandwiches",4
review_417016,drinks,Very nice wine bar.  They have a good selection of wine.\nMy husband chose a glass of wine that was not quite right when he tasted it.  The waitress quickly poured some to try and agreed.  Then she brought my husband several other selections until he was satisfied.\n\nBest place for Mollydooker wines.,3
review_215112,drinks,"I went here looking for coffee - not the house blend - but coffee from Ethiopia, Java, Turkey, the Netherlands, you name it.  I want my real coffee house experience back.  I want to choose the beans, I want to choose the grind and I want to choose the brewing method.  WTF?  Anything else is just a stand-in for Starbucks.  Okay, so the guy playing the guitar didn't ruin my inexpensive panini meal.  All told we walked out after having spent $22.00 on two sandwiches and water.  I have a panini press at home.  Why would I go back?",1
review_93298,drinks,"This place is a sweet dive. I've never been here on a busy night, but I do know that its a good place to enjoy cheap drinks  and edible bar food after work.",3
review_423147,drinks,great place to watch the game if you dont mind second hand smoke and smelling like an ash tray,2
review_389217,drinks,"Love the taro yogurt and mochi balls! The only down side is the lack of seating and the fifty bajillion college kids that swarm this place. Maybe that's just the old woman in me, but this place gets really loud! I definitely like it here better than Mojo's so I'll take my yogurt to go and enjoy it in peace!",3
review_552615,drinks,Very nice.  First time here and at a raw food restaurant.  Loved the enthusiam of Xavier!   Had a good mocha and tried the raw sweets!  Loved the coconut macaroons!   Atmosphere is very relaxing with cool jazz.  Next time will try a raw meal.,4
review_490643,drinks,"Craft cocktails, friendly bartenders and excellent appetizers. What more could you ask for? Their fries are excellent. I've had a few other small plates too, but it's the fries that I remember most. Go here if you are looking for a great drink during happy hour to start off your night right.",3
review_143139,drinks,"Our favorite pub in Las Vegas.\n\nGood food, great beer and close to the Strip. Make it a point to go!",3
review_346884,drinks,"Someone had told me that I had to check this place out for the coffee, espresso, and mocha things.  Well, the coffee didn't really impress me all that much. I had gotten a mocha and my friend got a latte. It definitely had enough caffeine but just wasn't that good. I tried my friend's latte and it wasn't that great either. Customer service was alright. The girl working was pretty nice. \n\nI didn't try any of the pastries which i probably should of but on the coffee itself I give 2 stars. If I come back here I'll update this.",1
review_331598,drinks,"Au sein du plateau Mont-Royal, cette petite brasserie artisanale aux allures contemporaines et branch\u00e9es a un petit quelque chose bien \u00e0 elle, qui s'explique peut-\u00eatre en partie dans la promiscuit\u00e9 qu'oblige sa petitesse. Calme en apr\u00e8s-midi et agit\u00e9e en soir\u00e9e, le R\u00e9servoir est un endroit qui s'affiche discr\u00e8tement sur la liste des brasseries montr\u00e9alaises. Pourtant elle m\u00e9rite le d\u00e9tour, ne serait-ce que pour go\u00fbter les produits qu'elle propose.\n\nLeurs bi\u00e8res anonymes, uniquement d\u00e9finies par le genre (Noire, Rousse, Blonde, Blanche, Scotch Ale, Weizen, etc.) ne sont pas pour autant sans \u00e2me. La Blonde (Pilesener), tr\u00e8s c\u00e9r\u00e9ali\u00e8re et anormalement limpide, semble cependant avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9touff\u00e9e par une montagne de houblon, comme si l'on avait voulu cacher quelconque anomalie gustative... La bi\u00e8re aux cerises se d\u00e9marque du lot.\n\nLes plats sont assez \u00e9labor\u00e9s; le rago\u00fbt de pieuvre et chorizo ou encore l'assiette de fromage, pour ne nommer que ceux-l\u00e0, tenteront sans doute les adeptes de tentacules et de moisissures bon go\u00fbt... \n\nLe verre n'est que 3,50$\n\nBonne machine \u00e0 espresso...",2
review_438832,drinks,"I go into Boba City cafe for a quick bite while i run my errands, i order a large avocado smoothie with boba and a vietnamese chicken sandwich. First off the pricing posted on the wall for this smoothie did not reflect the actual price which was taped to the 1 register. i end up psying $6 or $7 for a large smoothie which was waaaayy overpriced. It tasted like the avocados that had been used were over ripe. In a word putrid!! When i go and pay I had some bill and like 70 cents change which the cashier helped herself to as a tip instead of giving it me. This should have been the first inclination of trouble. The sandwich was ok, fresh. I take my food and siy in my car, then decide to go back in to ask if I could get another drink instead. The cashier then said I had to pay for another. Obviously if I'm asking for a new drink this must be disgusting. Overall the service was very poor and unprofessional and it seems to me that they are  trying to make up for the lack of customers by helping themselves to your change one customer at at a time. My advice is to got to Chinatown for better prices, tastier food, and faster service.\n\nDON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!!!",0
review_509383,drinks,"Best ice cream I've ever had...hands down. Their sherbet and shakes are also bomb. There isn't much more to say about this place other than the fact that it is a must-try place in Phoenix. The staff is friendly and the atmosphere is homey. Theres also a back patio where you can enjoy your treats. Located right by Federal Pizza, Postinos, and Windsor, it's easy to skip dessert at the restaurant and try this place for a change.\n\nOverall, if you love ice cream GO TO CHURN.",4
review_112579,drinks,"I had a good time at the depot cantina. It is a fun atmosphere and is a great place to grab some brews and food. I had some sampler platter which was extremely tasty! I like their tortilla chips and their salsa is pretty good. $2 Dos Equis all day every day and I am a fan of the dos. FYI, If you go here during a tempe event you can park but you have to pay $20 to do so, then they give you a ticket that you give to the waiter to get your $20 back. If you want some tasty mex food and alcohol this is probably the best spot to go in the tempe/mill area. Lot's of people watching and places to sit. I love the big margarita glasses and you get a discount on the tasty margs if you buy one and bring it back with you on your next visit.",2
review_49108,drinks,The bottom line is Gold Bar is a local spot with a devoted clientele.  It is chill and comfortable.,3
review_354523,drinks,"This is a lovely little cafe I stumbled upon off the Royal Mile. \n\nWe wanted to something warm to drink and a bite to eat for a late breakfast and our needs were met. They had a special with yogurt, granola and a pastry or toast (I can't seem to recall exactly, but I think it was a croissant), plus a juice and tea or coffee. \n\nThe food was good and my coffee was fresh and smooth, my boyfriend's tea was also nice, light and crisp. The orange juice was fresh and yummy.",4
review_638907,drinks,"I came here on a Tuesday night for Techno Taco Tuesdays. Their complimentary chips and salsa were good. Their salsa is not spicy. It's the slushy, mild kind. Their tacos were $2 that night. Their tacos normally are $3-$4 each. I already had an early dinner so only got two tacos- beef adobada and the veggie potato cheese taco. The tacos are small.\n\nThey have a very impressive craft beer selection. However, they need to know their beers. My husband ordered an IPA and one of the Belgian beers for the second round. The second beer tasted exactly like the first beer. When we asked the waiter, he said it was the right order. Uh, OK? My friend ordered an amber ale but they gave him one of the IPAs.\n\nI came here again the following week. The second time here, they forgot my friend's taco. No biggie, it happens. I got the carne asada and the veggie taco since I liked that one the last time. Carne asada was OK. Not bad or the best.\n\nI would come back during HH and please make sure you give people the right beer please!",2
review_567674,drinks,"Good Morning Coffee... I have a friend who's husband works in Marketing at Peet's Coffee in Seattle.  The ongoing joke finally came true (this joke was first told to me at least 9 years ago!) \""One day Starbucks is going to be so big, you will order your coffee and go to the bathroom, inside the bathroom there will be another Starbucks in there\""... Ok, much funnier in person, and when anyone else tells the joke! \n\nSafeway Starbucks. The only thing I don't like is when I order a \""Grande White Chocolate Mocha\"", they always ask if I want it hot... Im sorry, isn't there an iced version? If I wanted it iced I would have asked, and I didn't. So stream that bitch up and don't forget the whipped cream.. :0)",3
review_502022,drinks,"Total chaos order taker was lost, confused and obviously new or unfamiliar with her position. A frustrated manager in the back looked angry and was barking orders while scrambling to work the line, borderline rude to costumers. Cashier then gave me a Latte frap instead of an Iced Latte. This experience was awkward and uncomfortable to watch my first and last time at this location. Get a clue your job is costumer service if your in the weeds fine, keep cool but don't project your anger on costumers when its you who's in over your head, epic fail.",0
review_197864,drinks,"Loved the special margarita prepared tableside!  \nIf going with a group - definitely order \""The Feast!\"". One of everything on the menu. The portions are small but the number of plates is incredible!\nWill definitely go back next trip to Vegas!",3
review_86082,drinks,"I normally love Steep and Brew and buy coffee here all the time...however last night when I went here to study it was a really bad experience. The baristas seemed more focused on talking to each other and their friends than waiting on customers, continuously turned up the music so loud we had to ask them to turn it down, and were cursing loudly so the entire store could hear them: in a word, unprofessional. The coffee was great but the environment was not.",1
review_357430,drinks,"Lots of good beers here if you are a fan of \""something different\"". The first time I went here we had a make your own topping pizza which was delicious. I've been back two or three times since and cant say the pizza was memorable. So I guess its all in what you order. It seems a build your own is better then the predetermined ones. This place used to be a Mellow Mushroom, to me Revolution is like the same thing. \n\nI love the outdoor patio and the location is great (NODA)",3
review_344966,drinks,"Party atmosphere and sports bar with a dozen tv's, throw in a massive selection of wing flavors and you have Wild Wings Cafe.\n\nI was there with a few friends for St. Patty's Day (night?) and we took up a table for a few hours. The staff was attentive, even if they did manage to mess up the separate checks a little. With $2.75 Killians on special and $1.50 green beer, getting charged for an extra one wasn't a problem. The mixed drinks were mixed pretty strong. Our waiter did manage to split the appetizers for each of us, which was cool.\n\nWings. The house special. They -only- have 33 different flavors, from the bbq to the virgin all the way up to Braveheart. When they say hot, they mean hot. Mix and match, Tuesday is buy 1 get 1 free night. The Chicken Queso dip and the Hot Shots (deep fried sausage & cheese pastry) was great to share.",3
review_493194,drinks,My husband and I tried three drinks each here on Boxing day.  Each one was fabulous and our server never let us sit long before checking on us.,3
review_322961,drinks,I LOVE this place! I LOVE frozen yogurt!  What's not to love right?!\n\nAside from Yogels this is my favorite. Yogels is just a little less expensive as I remember. But whatever the case if I am at town square I'll stop by here. I kind of wish in the summer they stayed open later that would be nice!\n\nI'll add a few photos for ya!,3
review_230145,drinks,"Red Room Saloon is one of those places that you just don't really know about. It's funny because I knew it was a flair bar, but I've been too busy to go. My friends work there and I was just in shock when I went to open bar. Red Room is a small little bar with some tables and seats...recognized from Target. It's got gaming and 1 circle bar. It's funny because I saw some old friends. Erin who actually taught me to flair. There's Mike from Kahunaville. Toby Ellis, one of the best bartenders in the world. Then Mike showed me to a booth and found out he owned the place. Now Red Room has lots of potential. It was an open bar event hosted by spyonvegas.com and Skyy Vodka. Knowing who was serving drinks I knew it would be good. Definitely a fun place. The dj was cool. Not your typical top 40. Come on he made Neil Diamond cool. Definitely a lil off kilter, local bar. So yes a 5 star to support my friends and to support the community! Ok wait...knock off one star cuz parking did suck.",3
review_111522,drinks,"My girlfriend was in from Canada, so I took her to Mill Ave...we hit a lot of places, but this was by far the best. Awesome staff and selections!",4
review_646574,drinks,The Perq is probably one of the best sections in SLS.\n\nA solid place to grab an espresso drink on my way out.,3
review_172835,drinks,"For as long as i remember, I've always made it a point to stop and grab a meal here when I'm in Vegas. The location isn't too hard to find as it is in the Hard Rock Hotel. Atmosphere of the place is on the hip, rocker side. Some attractive guests and hostesses. \n\nThe selection of tequila and speciality drinks are really good. If you wanna try a particular tequila, this is a good place to try ones you may not of heard of. My particular favs would be Tequila Corralejo and Casa Noble. The Mi Casa margarita on the rocks is a great starter. \n\nMy main food order is usually the tacos. Either the carne asada, carnitas or the fish. The salsa is really good to with tortialla chips which are a bit on the thicker side so it has a nice crunch to it.",2
review_294724,drinks,"I don't drink ANY beer except for San Tan Sunspot Gold. This place has great food and fun people every time I go. It gets crowded at night and its pretty loud all the time, so I would not suggest having a business lunch here. Otherwise the staff are friendly, fast and get your order right. I really respect the owners/managers and choose to come here before anywhere else in Chandler to get my drink on.",3
review_362126,drinks,"I have to admit that I kind of like the idea of a donut place on Mill Avenue. \n\nThe store itself is small......it's more of a 'strip' than a full store if that makes any sense. It's a donut rack and cash register on the left....and a large self-serve coffee/beverage area on the right. And that's about it. \n\nBut I walked in, got two donuts, and was out in a jiffy. And there's nothing wrong with that.",2
review_607001,drinks,A nice selection of his own wines and others. Food was fantastic!   Had the stuffed mushrooms and pulled peek sliders. Yummy!  And everyone was very friendly!   Great combination. . Loved the atmosphere!,3
review_43608,drinks,"Love this place. I've been going to Zinc for several years and look forward to going for years to come. \n\nIt's dark?  Well yeah, that's the point! Those who are uncomfortable in the \""beautiful people\"" world of North Scottsdale will not be happy. BTW they have someone the best bartenders in town. Go on a Friday afternoon/evening, sit at the corner of the bar and have fun.",4
review_397973,drinks,Love this place. This stop is a must on my way to work. Just wish there was one closer to my house.,4
review_574537,drinks,"Coming from Southern California, the Boba(bubble tea) and milk tea here pales in comparison to what can be found in my home area. \n\nThe boba tasted meh. It was chewy, didn't taste fresh, and wasn't very good.\n\nThe milk tea itself was not horrible, but I've definitely had better. I had a taro milk tea. \n\nCustomer service was great though! \n\nMy advice, find another place for Boba and milk tea. Come here if only if you are really craving it, and do not have any other options.",1
review_47074,drinks,"I happened upon this place by accident.  My phone was being repaired at the Sprint store and I had to kill a couple hours.  I'm on holidays and didn't want to drive around, so I stopped into the bar for a couple beers.\n\nI did not eat.   The server was very friendly and efficient.  She chatted when I made conversation.  \n\nI really can't give a full review since I didn't eat, but I did enjoy the bar and the patio was beautiful!\n\nThey also have a shuttle service if you drink too much and need a rid home.",2
review_428822,drinks,Great place to hang out.  Kind of like a Cheers; where everyone knows your name.  Food was good & bartenders friendly.  Will definitely go again. :),3
review_374823,drinks,"Just for the sake of having Frozen Yogurt , You can visit here. Their Yogyrt is creamy like a icecream so i am not fan of it. Somebody who has eaten Frozen yogurt at yogurtland will not prefer to have this. It has nice seating though and right on Downtown Mill Avenue.",1
review_199572,drinks,"I regret suggesting we try this place again. I'd thought maybe the dessert would live up to its reputation in NYC but alas, I was wrong. Twice.\n\nThe 5th Avenue cream pie sucked big time. How can they go wrong? Could it be the water? \n\nI will definitely go to the original one in NYC when I visit next time. The cheesecakes, 5th Avenue and the borscht are the best there. \n\nSorry DD.",0
review_304507,drinks,"For me, it doesnt get much better then this. Well organized and a staff that actually knows about wine. VERY well priced as well. My BFF and I were in there last night to start shopping for wine for her impending wedding (sounds doom like, eh?). We found so many bargains we walked out of there with 14 different bottles to taste including several that were under 2 bucks (look out Charles Shaw!).. I tried the cab last night.. not to shabby, fruity and not to complex.. very accessible for non red lovers.. anyhoo one of the sales guys was so helpful! He turned me on (yes he was cute) to a section that was dedicated to Portugal.. who knew? Great value here and no stupid discount card needed!!",4
review_80712,drinks,"I love the Silver Surfer Margarita here. Service can sometimes be spotty but I can overlook that for this place. Lots of beers on tap too! The NODA area is a great place for a night out. Live music, great food and fun people. Cabo is definitely one of my favorite casual restaurant/bars in Charlotte to hang out with friends and people watch. The food has been inconsistent lately. I've been sticking to the Shrimp Tacos. The complimentary chips have been really stale and nasty lately. Love the bigger space and two bar areas as well as the outside seating.",3
review_609326,drinks,"My first Turkish coffee! It's super strong and bitter but I'm used to Italian espresso so everything will be alright. Served with a little cube of Turkish delight on the most gorgeous china.\n\nOverall vibes are much preferred over Neve aka university study hall central across the street. \n\nMenu serves up bagels, mezzes and muffins. \n\nNice to see a coffee shop in Montreal doing something a little differently.",3
review_283451,drinks,"It's as good as it gets for Scottsdale Espresso but watch your \""barista\"" if it doesn't take 11-18 seconds for an espresso pull it's coming out too fast. I am not a snob, I just know espresso and it's not because I worked at a Starbucks how DARE you!... oh damn, I am a snob. That's good for you, because you can trust me. So if you like gelato- it rocks, if you like espresso and feel a little \"" hip \"" go there and have a nice espresso or espresso drink. Another tip ? okay glad you asked- It should take about 10 seconds for the sprinkled sugar to break through the crema on top of the espresso ( that brownish head on top) if it doesn't - It's not the best it can be. \nYes I make them at home that well.",4
review_395505,drinks,"First off, I generally do not like most US. micro breweries. With that said this place is different- it's ALL about the beer, and they have done a great job. \n\nCheers!",3
review_10968,drinks,"Another great local cafe found by the power of yelp! This cafe is right by the major highways and was on my way driving through IL. Its on your right side after you turn into the street and the sign is easy to find. This place has lots of seating, a great big fireplace in the middle with couches around it makes the environment very inviting to sit down and chat with friends/coworkers. I tried an iced mocha with whipped cream topped, they offer their coffee in 3 sizes. With my iced mocha I also ordered a chocolate croissant. Both were delicious and there were so many different choices in dessert that i want to try! Next time Im in the area I am definetly going to have to try their tiramisu!!",3
review_482351,drinks,"I have to say this is my NEW fav!!!  Kennedy's Premium Bar & Grill is the newest addition to the historic Elizabeth area of Charlotte.  Great new deck with mini fire pits, lots of seating, and nice wide screen TV's inside AND out!  I think it just might be one of the better places to hang outside on a pretty day around Charlotte or when you're interested in catching a sporting event out and about!  Not a bad seat in the house that I could tell for TV access!  How's the food?  We had the Fried Goat Cheese Salad, which was a bit bland for my liking, but the Fish and Chips were scrumptious!  And there were a lot of other items that I look forward to checking out soon.  After eating we moved inside for trivia night (which we proceeded to win by the way!).  Really like the coziness of Kennedy's!  It just feels good.  Think I'll be going back this week....",3
review_213748,drinks,"I really do LOVE this Bar and Grill!!  We came here while visiting Vegas, and there is nothing wrong with a bar that rings a bell and pours shots directly into your mouth!\n\nWe had the nachos, and they were amazing.  I also ordered one of their mixed drinks that came in a HUGE mason jar.  it puts those rinky dink mason jars to shame!!\n\nMy friend and I took a few shots before/during the meal, so I thought the food was amazing at the time--that might cloud my review, just FYI.  But the nachos were amazing as was my burger.  And my friends' fries :)\n\nThere was a sign outside the door that was a little off-putting, though.  It said there was a 90 minute time limit for diners.  However, we were there for over two hours and our waitress couldn't have cared less!",3
review_447048,drinks,"I agree with others who thought it's a tad overpriced.  A group of us on a Sunday bike ride (the pedal kind) had a pit stop there and for some reason they have happy hour every day of the week - except Sundays.  Spring training season was over so the place was barely a quarter full on a lazy afternoon.  It's a nice place, but 3 domestic beers + tax/tip cost $18.   I'd expect to pay that at a club at night, but it's not a place I'd stop by again during the day for a casual bev with friends.  For some reason, a lot of Old Town places don't seem to realize there's a big difference between the day crowd and the night crowd.",1
review_474760,drinks,"Einstein Bros is one of the few franchises I respect, so this review is not about the food (although my lox was a bit sparing on the cream cheese); it's about the service.\n\nI came here quite cheery on a Saturday morning, and the one taking the orders was in such a vile mood.  I had to repeat my order to her several times because she was mumbling under her breath to repeat my order back to me, all while glaring at me as if to project whatever problems she was having. Fine.  Whatever.  However, even after finishing my meal she continued to be huffy, publicly.  I've never seen such a display before in front of so many customers.\n\nWarning to businesses about employee morale.",0
review_470825,drinks,"I actually visited this place twice in one day.  Both were fairly bad experiences.  The first time, the bar was empty so I sat by a table and it took a good while before I got a menu, or was asked what I wanted.  It also took awhile to just get a beer.  I ordered a simple meal and one beer and still didn't get to leave for over an hour!  I had to go to the bartender b/c the waiter was nowhere to be found and the manager had to cash me out.  I came back later that day, and literally stood in a packed bar for over 1 1/2 hours.  After being told by the hostess that a waitress is serving the area, I never once was offered a beer or anything to drink.  The waitress in the area just ignored me.  Their service is the worst i've ever seen in my entire life.  Blue 32 in Hermosa is much better.  I will never go to this bar again nor will I endorse it for anyone.  It's the worst bar in scottsdale as far as I'm concerned.",0
review_448564,drinks,"My girlfriends brought me here for my birthday lunch.. Food was great.. Margarita's were even better! Especially the Skinny Margarita (which I added GrandMa too and it became a \""somewhat thin\"" Margarita). Lori our bartender was very patient with us.. which was SO needed, as my GF's can be very High Maintenance! Great atmosphere.. we people watched -which is always fun in Vegas.  \n\nThanks for making my birthday lunch a fun time and Thanks Lori for being very attentive and giving us great service!",3
review_4213,drinks,"The frozen cosmos and mimosas are great, especially on special during happy hour. They also have a great list of beers and other cocktails. \nThe menu is a little creative but has mostly basic bar food. If salad is your thing you must get the one with beets and goat cheese.",3
review_185010,drinks,"Since we sat in the Vino Lounge for our UYE last night, I guess it's appropriate that I post my review here :)\n\nIt was kind of a quiet Sunday evening, but it was the perfect place to chill with a group of people.  The breeze on the patio was refreshing and like Kristin said, they did a good job with the decor with the white linen curtains shielding you from a view of the parking lot...\n\nJanuary, our server, was extremely outgoing and sweet.  I had several glasses of the Sauv Blanc which was light, crisp, and fresh - the ideal beverage for the warm evening we had!  It went well with the food I tasted as well... I tried the petite lobster corn dogs (how can you not order those?!); the handcut pomme frites dusted with indian curry and murray river saltl short rib, seared scallops with yellow curry foam and mango caviar; roasted baby artichokes with brown butter and fifty-year-old spanish sherry; and wild mushrooms with cognac and chervil.  My bf had all of those as well as the cheese plate.  We enjoyed everything we had, even though the servings were pretty small.  I expected the items that were on the dinner menu to be larger portion sizes, but everything was on the small side, so be prepared!\n\nThe menu items we ordered added up and got a little bit pricey, but it was a fun evening, so it was worth it!  Thanks again to all of you who came to hang... we'll have to do it again soon!",3

review_419284,drinks,"I try to avoid this location as much as possible, but it's one of the only Starbucks close to my Thursday commute. They service is SLOW.

review_354632,drinks,"The Blue Blazer is quite a traditional pub that is situated near the strip clubs of the West Port. However, despite its proximity to the sleaze of this area it manages to retain an air of civility and is generally a nice place to drink. The bar is very beautiful (wooden and old fashioned) and stocks a wide choice of whisky and real ales. This pub's speciality is rum though, and if you fancy trying one from their large selection ask the bar man's advice and he'll point you in the right direction. The prices here are not particularly cheap, but this manages to keep the students over the road in The Chanter (every cloud has a silver lining...). If you're looking for a nice traditional pub to drop into after a show at the Lyceum or Usher Hall, the Blue Blazer is perfectly located.",3
review_419472,drinks,"The location is super convenient.... the parking situation, not so...  I've run in here for a time or two to get my afternoon coffee fix, one where I attempted to park and almost got hit by 2 cars... the other through the drive through, when it was less busy, but still managed to have a close call with one of the cars trying to leave the parking lot at the same time.\n\nIt's on Kings so everything is sort of crammed into the area.  It would be nice to be walking on the newly constructed/(still under construction) green-way and then stop in (take the cars out of the equation).  \n\nEh.... near death experiences aside, it's definitely worth the risk for coffee.",2
review_267538,drinks,"We didn't get to spend nearly as much time here as we would like to have.  We got into Vegas at 1pm and after checking in and unpacking, it was nearly 2 before we got there.  We had dinner reservations at Treasures (see review) at 8 so we didn't want to eat too much.    \n\nWe were seated quickly in a cozy and comfortable corner of the place.  I WANTED the shepherds pie but again given that we didn't want to eat too much we ordered the onion rings and the Beer Cheese dip.  \n\nImpulsively I ordered a Guinness and it was not until later that I realized that this place knows the difference between a Black and Tan (Guinness and Bass) and a Half and Half (Guinness and Harp) knowing the difference makes all of the difference in the world to an Irish Pub Snob like me.  \n\nThe onion rings were VERY good and I believe made with their Bloody Mayr mix.\n\nThe Beer Cheese dip... lets just say... that was fantastic!  served with a verity of breads and what appeared to be a bit of a Parmesan crust on top of the dip, it was heavenly.  And here's the thing... I really don't like chess all that much, this was something my wife ordered.  \n\nDespite being in a Las Vegas Casino the place had a warm and cozy feeling to it and inspired talk of opening up our own pub when we retire.",3

They make first class omlettes and other terrific breakfast foods but their Bloody Marys are delicious and defintely worth the price. Definitely get one there.

Just the idea of textured balls in my drink made me a bit creeped out but I was strong and fought through my gagging to visit Fresh Cup.\n\nUpon entering fresh cup Joey M. and I realized we were definitely the only non-Asian customers but we weren't treated any differently which is  fairly refreshing when you dine on Spring Mountain.\n\nThe list of smoothies is long and there are so many intriguingly delicious from Kiwi to Lychee to Taro. They also have all the basic flavors so you don't have to get too crazy if you're trying it for the first time(HONEYDEW=THE NUTS). After trying a boba smoothie that first time I was back at least 3-4 times within 2 weeks to try new flavors.\n\nFresh Cup also has a sweet rewards program which gives you free smoothies every once in a while and as a Jew I can't hate on free stuff. YAY FREE STUFF!",4

I mean, almost 6 bucks for a small iced green tea boba? It's just a bit much. \nThe positives: huge menu of every kind of tea I can think of, and at least a hundred more that I can't. Polite enough service, and the tea was REALLY good. \nDefinitely not a good place for a nice cheap treat though.",2

review_626605,drinks,"So this is different!!!\n\nLooking for an after dinner dessert places on yelp, I came across this little place. I had never had this type of desert drinks before.\n\nI grabbed the number 6 off the menu and not knowing what I ordered I felt like I was ordering into the food order unknown! My unknown drink came out in a boba/soda like cup with a straw and spoon. I made the mistake of jumping in with the straw first and was unable to drink anything with the amount of jelly and other assorted stuff! Make sure to stir!\n\nThe menu has quite an extensive array of drinks and desserts which I think run up to about 50 or 60 things!\n\nThe decor is a cross between lounge and cafe!! Also it's Nice and clean as well.\n\nMy drink was good, I'm not gonna lie is was ok. I saw quite a few Java drinks that looked pretty sexy and next time I'll grab one...\n\nI think this a hit or miss kinda joint! You'll like or love it",2

They didn't do much to change the interior sinec it was REV coffee, kept most of the TI's that were already in place.  Coffee was okay, not bad per se, but just typical convenience type coffee. It was very hot when served (too hot).   Compared it with the Dunkin Donuts decaf that we later got, DD was of course better.   Out of their 2 donuts, one was too \""fried\"".

Ample seating, open 24 hrs a day, decent coffee and good soup, these make for a good alternative work environment.\n\nThey have tons of sweets, yet I don't think a single one of them is vegan so no good there. The bread you get along with your soup is animal friendly though :). The staff is all quite nice and they do well in the unique layout of the shop. Tons of space inside and out.\n\nTheir coffee is not the greatest but it's decent and I wish they had more options for us picky animal lovers, but it's still a rather nice place.",3

Bathrooms here are kind of dirty, the doors don't lock, and it's hardly clean. \nAgain, it's a dive bar. Don't expect much from this place. Bring good company and you'll have a good time.",2
review_346458,drinks,"Hello hotel bar! But I do have to say, it's better than some hotel bars I have had the pleasure to visit in the not so distant past.  I have found in my recent travels that bartenders at hotel bars are really friendly, and District's did not disappoint tonight. All three that waited on us were extremely friendly and helpful. I also appreciated that if you valet, you can get your parking validated and get up to three hours for free. The valet was very quick and the gentlemen that helped me tonight were also very friendly...dare I say the friendliest valets I have encountered in the Valley even! There was live music tonight, but at times it was a bit too loud. However, any guy with a guitar that plays a ton of songs I like is OK in my book...plus I thought he was pretty good.\n\nWe sat at the bar tonight which was very enjoyable. The bottle of sauvignon blanc was crisp and quite delicious, especially after a long week of work. We ordered the Chesapeake Bay crab cakes and the chips and dip. Normally I do not like crab cakes that are crispy on the outside, but the coating was light and didn't detract from the crabmeat. While there was not as much crabmeat as I would have liked, what was in there was tasty and there was almost no filler! Woo hoo! I can't say they are identical to what you would find back in Maryland, they are not far off enough where I can hate on them. The chips and dip were a nice snack...in fact, I almost gasped when I saw how large the serving was of chips! The dill dip was really tasty and a nice compliment to the chips. For the bottle of wine, the crabcakes and the chips and dip, our bill came to $45.\n\nI'm wavering between 3 and 4 stars, but will round down to 3 since there was nothing incredibly special or memorable about my experience. While the District menu does not have me running back, I can see this being a place to meet friends after work for drinks and appetizers or as a place where my coworkers and I run to for lunch when we need a drink or two to make it through the rest of the day!",2

Where was all this when I lived walking distance?\n\nI love The Black Chicken, but now that there is a crepe place and this amazing bottle shop next door, I could spend an entire day here without walking more than 15 feet.\n\nI heard of these guys from my friends at The Chicken and followed their development on Facebook until they opened the doors. The owners actually recognized me and knew my name on my first visit! \n\nWith a focus on local beers (NC/SC), there is plenty of space at the marble bar and lots of sofas and large tables to enjoy your drafts. Speaking of, they have a lot of taps going with a nice variety. Lots of local and Belgian beers (the genres I gravitate towards...I think they opened just for me). They are getting some cool stuff in, too, like a recent small-batch collaboration between NoDa and Mother Earth. Talk about awesome!\n\nThen there is the retail area, with shelf after shelf of delicious bottled suds, again with a local focus. The staff are incredibly knowledgeable and just as friendly, and will gladly talk beer and point out a few for you to try.\n\nNeedless to say, I'm a bit of a fan.

review_349831,drinks,"If you are looking for a taste of the rich life without actually being rich, then consider hitting Sushi Roku at The W hotel between 5pm and 6:30pm Monday through Saturday.\n\nThis place is great for a date or a place to kick it with friends. You are at The W, so you have the upscale feeling of being posh, and because the prices are so good during happy hour, you can actually have the satisfaction of saying \""I'll have one of everything on the menu\"" which is exactly what I did!\n\nAtmosphere: Sushi Roku is a quintessential modern Asian establishment. While it is chic, it is oddly authentically Asian. It feels open yet intimate at the same time.\n\nMy favorites from the menu:\n\nSushi Roku Fusion ($4 a glass, $18 a pitcher). As you walk past the bar you will notice a gigantic glass jug filled with fruit and vodka. This is the Fusion, and it is deliciously addicting, yet sneakily strong.\n\nMy favorite sake, nigori sake (cold, unfiltered sake which in in my opinion has a lot more flavor and is smoother) and also hot sake for just $4.\n\nMiso Eggplant ($5). I have never EVER desired eggplant or ordered it at a restaurant, but after trying this dish, at least once a week I find myself salivating over the thought of the Miso Eggplant. This appetizer is a big reason I keep coming back.\n\nSaut\u00e9ed Chinese Green Beans ($3). Crunchy and flavorful, these beans are the beans knees! I don't fancy myself a vegetarian, but I have never been so delighted eating a plate of straight veggies.\n\nTuna Tartar ($6). If you like raw tuna and avocado, this dish will melt your taste buds. Don't let the ugly name fool you. This is a beautiful dish with a beautiful taste.\n\nOysters ($2.5 each). These oysters have more flavor that most any other oyster I've swallowed. They have a garnish of Asian citrus flavors which subtly mask the true oceanic taste of the oyster, so if you are looking for the traditional unadulterated oysters, these may not be the ones for you.\n\nOn a side note, kudos to the staff.

review_471575,drinks,"Headed to Dominion Square Tavern after it long being on my list of to-do's in Montreal and now I'm left wondering 'what's the fuss all about?'\n\nWe arrived just as they opened on a Saturday afternoon and sat at the bar. The place was empty save for a party of three at the end of the bar. I ordered a Basil Rye while the BF ordered a Canuck. Both cocktails were okay, but nothing spectacular. Most disappointing to me was that these cocktails were rather tiny, yet still managed to lack alcohol!\n\nI decided on the gravlax to start and the beet salad was my main dish while my BF ordered a Scotch egg and his main was bangers and mash.\n\nThe gravlax was good, but my oh my was this a small portion! I guess I understand but honestly, at $13, 4 thin slices of salmon was pretty disappointing. \n\nMy main was a disaster. Okay. Beet salad has NEVER disappointed me before, but this, this was an error in judgement on all levels from presentation to flavour. The beets are in a bowl... like a small diner soup bowl. They are topped with a mix of the base cuts of romaine, with the thick white vein begin the majority of the 'meat', topped still with the palest celery leaves I have ever seen. Crumbled with goat cheese and a ranch vinaigrette. Impossible to eat without everything toppling out of the bowl and onto the bar. But then again, it didn't taste very good, so who cares. With more than half the main left in the bowl, the waiter didn't even blink to ask if it was okay. \n\nThe BF got one Scotch egg for $14. It was good, he liked it. I wasn't a fan. But hey, that's me. His main, the bangers and mash must have been good because I didn't get a bite of it! \n\nWe gave the sticky toffee pudding a go too. Blah. That's not sticky toffee pudding. That is cake with the ingredients for sticky toffee pudding added to some extent to the mix, but that doesn't make it sticky toffee pudding, it makes it sticky toffee pudding flavoured cake. \n\nIf you haven't guessed it yet, I was sorely disappointed by my experience. The food was mediocre at best, and the service was sparse, inattentive and unhelpful. I won't be returning.",1

review_389197,drinks,"I've never been to a place like Yogurtland before.  I didn't know what to expect beyond, well, frozen yogurt.  I walked in to a line of fit young ladies pumping their own frozen yogurt from soft serve machines that line one wall with a variety of flavors.  I sampled Dutch Cocoa, Coconut, Mango, Strawberry, and Taro today.  Taro was my favorite!  After you fill your bowl to your liking with frozen yogurt, you can add on a variety of delightful toppings, including Cap'n Crunch, red beans, crumbled candy bars (like Kit Kat and Butterfinger), or pretty sprinkles.  Then you hand your creation over to the man/woman behind the cash register... They put the yogurt cup onto the scale, and you get your total based on the weight!  So cool!  So easy... So refreshing!

We chose to eat in the pub area which was showing a footie game on a huge screen. Reasonable bill at the end of it all. I'd probably pop in again if I was in the area and wanted a safe bet.

review_303145,drinks,"I just wrote a review on another coffee shop citing what my five star criteria are - I figure I better give an example also - this is it.\nExcellent green sourced coffee (they have CoE - cup of excellence varieties available) is roasted and prepared by skilled Baristas right there in the shop.  A variety of single origin and blend bags of beans are for sale - all with roast dates printed on the bags.  Both drip and espresso brewing methods are given the attention to detail that a coffee snob would give at home - and in the end, all the finished products have the quality, variety, and complexity of flavors that excellent coffee should have.\nMy only complaints would be;  1) They prefer to source all their beans from latin america (my guess is due to locality) - would be nice if they had some Ethiopian and Indonesian varieties as well (just some different notes), and 2) A less than a pound (I believe it's 12oz) bag of CoE beans sells for about $18 / bag (with tax) right now - pretty steep, although I calculate it's that's still only about $1 / cup at home.\nLastly, concerning ambience and service - I don't grade on these factors unless they are significant detractors - and they are definitely not at the Cartel.  However, I will say, I think the complaints about service by other yelpers are unwarranted - this is a shop that caters to coffee snobs and casual drinkers / students alike.  If they tell you that you're ordering real --fill in cup here-- and not --fill in sugared up chain drink here--, that's to try to convey what you're getting so as to not disappoint your whipped-cream loving desensitized pallette (they're doing you a favor).

review_327098,drinks,"Nestled in Phillips Place, Dean & Deluca Wine Room is the perfect little spot to grab a quick bite before a movie or linger on the patio and enjoy a bottle of vino. You'll see all sorts of customers here - from a gaggle of early twenty-somethings to a few seasoned winos enjoying a tasty glass of Pinot Noir.  \n\nTheir menu is pretty straightforward and is filled with little bites, salads, small sandwiches and a smattering of sushi. I'm a bit of a sushi snob and I can happily say they make some great, classic rolls here! The fish has always been fresh and the rolls are pretty large. Price wise, both the wine and the eats are priced fairly and I feel like they offer quite a bit of food for the cost. \n\nI'm a big fan of the Tuscan Bean app - you get a boatload of toasted, buttered crostini with a large ramakin filled with white beans, garlic, tomatoes, olive oil, black pepper, etc. Yum. I've also tasted their cheese plates and they are typically quite generous with their three cheese choices and always provide side items like walnuts, raisins, figs, etc. \n\nLast but not least, I'm a big fan of their wine flights. They are reasonably priced and offer patrons a great trio of vino fun. I've tried a few red flights and their bubbly flight.

review_109134,drinks,"Reasons to go to Four Peaks:  1) You're hungry, 2) you're thirsty, 3) you're meeting friends with a wide variety of palates, 4) you're meeting a LOT of friends,  5) you're meeting friends who like to play photo hunt, and don't need the \""erotic\"" adjective to find it fun, 6) you're meeting people who you don't plan to talk to, so having a game on in every corner of the room is to your benefit.  \n\nFour peaks is comfort bar food with comfort beer.  It isn't the greatest, but it is far from the worst.  It was a fantastic place to go after the Tour de Fat in Tempe.... when people wanted a little grease, a place to sit, and one more beer.",2
review_487171,drinks,"Human Bean has the best coffee in this area, which is mostly Starbucks on every corner (there's one other place hidden behind Southern Hills Hospital, but I'm not sure if they're even open any more). I'm a no-frills coffee drinker, so I've never tried any of the specialty/blended drinks. Judging by the menu they're up to a dollar cheaper than most coffee chains; a lot of other reviewers seem to love them. That being said, the coffee and espresso, while not the best I've ever had, is VERY tasty - I could probably drink it black, though I usually ask for a little bit of cream, just so it cools down quicker. The chocolate covered espresso bean that comes with every drink is a nice touch too.\n\nThe baristas are super friendly, helpful, speedy and always remember what you prefer, even if you only show up once every couple weeks (I'll admit that it doesn't hurt that all the baristas that have served me here are pretty girls with cheery personalities). My first time there, about a year ago, they explained their punch card and specials - there's a double punch day (Wednesday), you get a free drink once the card is full and I'm pretty sure they have a happy hour, I think it's from 4-6.\n\nMy only complaint is that I don't live very close to this location any more! It was really convenient on days that I didn't have time to make my own coffee at home. I wish they'd open more locations. Lucky for me, my mom still lives in this area, so when I visit her I always make a stop.\n\nBottom line: Convenient if you're in the area, great staff, fast service and damn good espresso.",3

review_610142,drinks,"Cooling you and your loved ones down with a smoothie, shake or shaved ice in this trying triple digit heat and intentionally or unintentionally doing a good deed (for every smoothie or shake purchase you are helping to feed a local child in need via Three Square Food Bank) is simply way cool!\n\nUnless you have a custom craving that can only be met by your unique blend of flavors engineering, you can easily get very nice pre-formulated house combos in the shake and smoothies departments.  Probably save a buck too.  \n\nThe Morning After Shake is the most unconventional, with bacon, OJ and maple syrup in the concoction.  I might order it if the bacon was baked crisp and rendered of most of its otherwise flavorful bacon grease.  This will likely appeal to the \""I dare you\"" kids & kid at heart crowd.  Although everyone I know that was at the grand opening thought about getting this bacon shake, none actually went through and ordered it to pop their FGS cherry.\n\nSince Nutella basically goes well with just about any dessert, but was not featured in any of the existing House Designs Shakes, I was forced to \""architect\"" my own blend with Hershey's Cookies & Cream Chocolate Bar + Nutella, with a base of non-fat yogurt and low-fat milk.  The result was okay, but not the Nutella chocolate bliss I was hoping for.  I hypothesize that the same amount of Nutella is added to a 16 oz order as the 24 oz order, thus the larger the size the more diluted the flavor.  \n\nThe shake was also loose in consistency, not the thicker shake that requires you to channel your inner Dyson vacuum power to get it through the boba straw.  (Viscosity of the shake could also be affected by the huge turnout at the grand opening event.  Big line of customers that went out the door for 2 hours straight = less or insufficient amount of time for the frozen yogurt machine to semi-freeze the yogurt mixture before it was dispensed into blenders as orders came in).  \n\nNelson Q was also at the FGS \""grand opening\"" festivity, and ordered the Almondcado, which he said was good.  So next time I go, that will be what I will try from their Smoothie menu. \n\nI will be back to give it another try when the ordering condition is more normal.  Plus it is for a good cause!!!",2

The one inside Frys and Safeway a few miles north are great.\n\nWe rarely frequent this location since it seems almost every time we go the coffee tastes burnt or stale. If I'm paying 5$ for coffee I am really expecting the best possible quality. The young kids that work here are all very friendly and seem to always be working (cleaning, stocking etc). I just want to be clear that this review is strictly product based and not employee based.\nI don't know if they aren't stocked as frequently as other Starbucks or what the deal is but they seem to be out of common orders a lot. \n\nThis location is very convenient being off the 17 and carefree highway. It's unfortunate that they will most likely never do anything to improve this location as I'm sure they get a lot of traffic from people traveling. That being said, if they made a few minor improvements I'm sure more people from the surrounding neighborhoods would visit this location instead of the other three Starbucks just a few miles north.",1

Okay, so maybe the decor is teetering on the edge of cheesy, but the food is definitely above standard, and the vegetarian options made it an ideal destination in my vegetarian days.\nI've honestly never had a \""bad\"" veggie burger here, the combinations they think of are seriously out of this world delicious. On $5 burger night, it is 100% worth it to head down to the southside and grab 1 or 2.

review_181182,drinks,"I can only review the maragaritas and tableside guacamole at Diego's as my husband and I only stopped by here on a whim to start out our night with some apps and drinks ... but when we were done and leaving I was left wishing we didn't have a reservation at a different restaurant because I was DYING for some more yummy mexican food!  \n\n5 stars on all counts : seated us quickly in the fun and funky bar area on a nice cushy booth type seat.  an IMMENSE margarita/tequila menu with some of our favorite harder-to-find tequilas.  the delicious, fresh, salty chips came with a trio (or was it quartet?) of amazing salsas ranging from the mild pico to the kicky green stuff to the hot hot chipotle one.  my giant margarita was delicious (my benchmark for rating a mexican place is their margarita - I'm a lime and salt and tequila girl!).  the service was great, attentive but not too over the top, they could tell that we wanted to be left alone to our canoodling (what? - don't you canoodle in Vegas?!).  and the guacamole.  oh, their guacamole.  you've got to hope that when you pay close to twenty buckaroos for a smash up of avocados and some onions and jalape\u00f1os that it's going to be worth it ... and yes, this guac is worth it. i dream about this guacamole.  I can't wait to go back to Vegas and when I do then this guacamole will be one of the first things to touch my lips.  So good.    \n\nLoved loved loved Diego's!",4
review_368703,drinks,"I've been to some great airport lounges, but this one was just okay compared to those. They have great, friendly staff and a full bar to get you through your travels. There were some light snacks, but nothing to really tie you over if you have a long layover. I would probably wander down to the Wolfgang Puck Express to feed my belly.  I hung out here for a bit before my flight. They do have internet, but it is unsecure, so I just hooked up my laptop to my phone for some secure internet browsing. They had football on the tv, which would be fine, but some of the inebriated patrons of this lounge made for a less enjoyable experience. As someone else mentioned before, this lounge was frequented by an older crowd. A nice spot to get away from the hustle and bustle of McCarran.",2

I must admit, I'm impressed! \n\nFrom the quaint \""drive through\"" that turned out to be a door you simply pull up to and an employee comes out to take your order from you while you sit in your car.. to the eclectic and hip interior. I was sold even before I sat down to take a sip of one of the most delish  mochas I've had in the states. Strong and rich w/o being too sweet!!! Perfect! This chocolaty masterpiece easily surpasses mochas de la Starbucks. \n\nCooper Star is on my \""Visit Again & Again\"" list. \n\nIf you are reading this ignore all the other reviews that say less and come visit this place yourself. Simply delightful!!",4
review_521987,drinks,Sets the bar for bad service. Drinks forgotten and then wrong ones hastily delivered.

It's cozy and interesting inside, the staff is nice.  However, on my last visit, the cappuccino I ordered was wayyy too foamy and didn't really taste much like a cappuccino, or much like anything.  This may be due to the skills of that particular barista, but next time I stop in, I'll probably just save my money and order a drip coffee.  However, still a great place to hang out.",2
review_213104,drinks,"Going to keep this short.\n\nTriple 7 is a cool local place that serves cheap (VERY DECENT) craft beers (23 oz $3.95) and typical bar foods (CHEAP) with sushi randomly thrown in there. \n\nFrom my experience... skip the prime rib, it was pretty ugly, overcooked and well ugly.  They run food specials all the time depending on the nearby holiday, but your mileage will vary on the taste. Stick to the classics (burgers, sandwiches, salads, etc) to be safe. \n\nThey brews come in a good classic variety: kolsch, pale lager, red ale, stout, and porter. They carry special releases like their cherry stout that I heard is a must. \n\nI don't know the quality of the sushi or fish freshness at Triple 7, but there is a Japanese chef if that helps lol. \n\nOverall place to visit as a tourist and a local for some low key bonding time with the homies.",3

We had this whole friendly VIBE going on. \n\nShe passed my empty cup to the second girl making the drinks, who accidently dropped the friendly vibe on the floor and stepped all over it.\n\nShe gave me a coffee with no vanilla and no milk, and half full with ice. As I stared dubiously, hesitantly, I asked her if that was mine. She confirmed and walked away. I asked nicely if I could have vanilla flavoring, milk, and a little more ice, and I apologized for being difficult. \n\nShe told me that she would put some vanilla in it for me, but I could use the room temp milk that was behind me on the coffee condiment bar.\n\nI told her that I'd rather have fresh cold milk since there wasn't much ice, and she said she would have to check and see (?). She put a dallop of milk without asking what percent i'd like or how much, slammed the lid on the coffee, and turned around and went in the back.\n\nBeware the unmedicated sirens of Tully's.",1

The staff was friendly and attentive and I like that they still had specials going on a Friday night. They had live music going, but I actually didn't realize it was live until we got up to leave and I saw the band. The patio looked nice, but it was a rainy night, so we just stayed in.

On Friday afternoons, it's rather a cool hangout, and great ambiance. \n\nTheir food, however, sucks.  It's supposed to be Asian fusion, and while I am still enjoying any \""fusion\"" type place (aka, a hint of ethnic, a ton of Americanization), this is rather mediocre food at best, completely vegetarian unfriendly (which is odd, given the fact that this is Madison).\n\nService is good though, the staff is kind and attentive.\n\nBut I'd only go there for drinks.

The happy hour prices are awesome - you can get a pitcher or a pint and I think during happy hour the pitchers are only a dollar more than a pint. So that's a tough decision ha ha!\n\nNext, this place is dog friendly on the patio. So bring your pup and some friends next time. They have a dog wash station and a little dog bowl bar to keep your canine buddy hydrated. They even bake homemade dog treats from leftover grain from the beer making process.\n\nThey also have beer events and smoke meats on the patio for barbecues. If any of this sounds appetizing to you, plan a happy hour with your friends at OSHO!

At times, it almost seems like a school for young up-and-coming cocktail artists, marshaled by the seasoned head bartender.\n\nThe cocktail menu is refreshing in its focus on classic and prohibition era cocktails, but if you are in the mood for something more modern or unique, the bartender will mix you up something fancy and catering to your specific tastes.\n\nThe atmosphere is very calm and cozy, a great place to relax after dinner or to recover from a taxing experience in a more 'energetic' bar.  The music I can't quite remember, but I'd like to say it was Jazz.

If you are an earl gray fan, the earl gray creme makes a nice diversion from an \""everyday\"" earl gray. The earl gray white is pretty good as well. The quality of their teas is middling at best, and they have an over-abundance of fruity blends that won't appeal to most serious tea drinkers.\n\nThe store itself is obnoxious. They have hawkers out front trying to lure passersby into getting samples of tea, which is annoying in and of itself to the point that I go out of my way NOT to walk by their store. Once you get inside, they are very aggressive about selling you large quantities of tea in overpriced containers. The rest of their merchandise is overpriced as well--if you are looking for any kind of kettle, tea mug, or other accessory, shop around before you pay Teavana's prices. As others have noted, make sure you pay close attention to how much tea they are ringing up and request a regular bag unless you want to be charged for the container. You do NOT need a pound of tea unless you are a fanatical tea drinker going through 10-12 cups a day. 6 ounces of tea is plenty for almost anyone.",1

My only complaint was the interaction with some of the baristas. Without forgetting my schizophrenia meds or being overly paranoid, I felt like they were being weird and whispering about me, avoiding eye contact, forcing polite responses, and watching as I left, which made me feel uncomfortable.

We gave up and left after waiting (standing) in line for fifteen minutes. It was more aligned with a keg party.  Not that we were upset, since instead of a sipping and a true tequila experience, we were really in the middle of a \""free shot\"" until you get really, really drunk experience.

It is really high quality, and this location has some of the better baristas in the employ of CB&TL. As other Yelpers mentioned, its usually hopping because of the proximity to UNLV. It is also super UNLV friendly with a discount for students, faculty and staff. Knowing that the price of the Starbucks in the Student Union is crazy high, its great to know that you can be rewarded for your studenthood, or general fondness for education at CB&TL. Today, I came in to order my usual the Soy African Sunrise Tea Latte. However, I was informed by the manager (much to my dismay) that the corporate office has discontinued the African Sunrise tea. That is a huge bummer. The manager then recommended a decaf Chai tea that was amazing. \nI didn't get a pastry today, but I am a fan of the donuts and scones.

However please remember they are a coffee shop and bakery, I was in there the other day around lunch and there were quite a few people coming in looking for lunch type items which they do not carry.\nLastly and what makes this place is the girl that works behind the counter (wish I had gotten her name).  She has been in there everytime I have gone (4 times in the last week) and she is always happy and cheerful.  Greets everyone with a smile and is patient while you try to make the difficult selection of what you will try that day.  \nKeep up the great work and I will keep coming back!!!",4

I was looking for salmon but most are tempura salmon. I want my fish rare not cook. only the MonKey brains was good to me. however, friendly waiter and fast service",2
review_368288,drinks,"Finally... a coffee/light lunch place that's a little bit different from all the millions of others in this area.\n\nYes, they do cakes, pastries, coffee and tea. But as far as I know this is the only swiss caf\u00e9 in Bruntsfield, which means that instead of the same old muffins and cookies you get in most other places, here you get stollen and pretzels. What's more, this place prides itself on making everything from scratch and on-site, or rather, \""Qualit\u00e4t aus Meisterhand\"" as they put it.\n\nThe other great thing about them is that they'll also bake you an entire cake exactly to your liking if you order in advance. So next time you're trying to show off your domesticated baking skills, but accidentally forget to turn the oven on or use the wrong type of flour, this place will save the day.\n\nMy only criticism? It's too far from my new flat!",3
review_490658,drinks,"If you want to enjoy some well-made cocktails in a cozy, upscale atmosphere, then Merchant Madison is the perfect place.\n\nIt's one part liquor store, one part music venue, and one part cocktail lounge that also happens to serve delicious food.\n\nThe cocktail menu is impressive  Drinks are listed by spirit and the selection is massive(it was practically a book!). I sucked down quite a few of a tasty concoction named 'The Regret,' which featured Death's Door gin or vodka (I opted for the gin), fresh lime juice, and rosemary. It was a most delightful libation: clean, crisp, and citrusy. (And the name is spot on; I experienced my own \""regret\"" in the form of a mild hangover the next morning.)\n\nThe cocktologists were all friendly and hipster-y, in their knit hats, looking like they participate in Movember year-round.\n\nMM has nightly specials like \""Wine and Dine\"" on Wednesdays, and \""Burger and Beer\"" on Mondays. Plenty to like about this place, and I haven't even tried the food yet.\n\nLooking forward to working my way through all the inventive cocktails. Good thing several more trips to Madison are on the docket.",3

review_304149,drinks,"As I continue on my qwest for the perfect cup o joe at the perfect location, I stumble across Solo Cafe. The ambience is very laid back and I like the decor. The coffee is pretty good, however the past few times I've been they do not have food. Zero, zilch, nada. They do have the displays out in plain view, but they are and remain empty. I don't alway want coffee, sometimes I prefer just a muffin and a glass of h2o. The seating arrangements isn't the most comfortable, so be sure to try to go during off peak times since you may not find a seat or one near an outlet. The noise level is pretty tolerable and they don't play overhead music too loud. Parking is fairly easy, however, since it is surrounded by many other businesses, you'll be competing for spaces with their customers, but it's never been an issue for me. The wifi works great and is fast, which is a huge plus. All in all a fairly decent place to study or grab a quick Nibble, oh wait, I take that back, they don't have any nibbles. :/",2

As it were, there just aren't any here for us to go to!  \n\nWhile I've been the ONE i've found in SoCal (Anaheim), this one was quicker and had twice as many places to park.  It also had a drive-up one... well, it seemed like a normal drive in. People left instead of eating in their cars.  Anyways, you guys all know how it works.  Push the magical red button, order to your hearts content (GET A CHERRY LIMEADE!), and anxiously await.  There are no skates, though there was a guy who had a tray of extra napkins, ketchup, etc who walked around.  Nice touch Scottsdale.\n\nI always get a hamburger with mayo.

Seat yourself but we didnt want to take all night so we went to the bar. After 5 minutes and yes I time these things...we had to flag down waitstaff to ask do we have a waitress. Oh year guy behind the bar will be over.\nSo he finally makes it over with virtually no greeting and a bar towel in his hand. \nNo small plates available on sat night after 12. Ok i guess you have to send the cook home sometime. \nThe wine selection was weak. Their best wines were not even close to being the quality I expect. The price was in line for a great location but with the inattentive service and lack of class why would I pay 17/glass for a 2md tier cab?\nThey did not have a selection of decent red blends.  \nWe walked out without ordering.,0

Always crowded... maybe it the free internet? Windows gallor and outside seating. I love Sq. Hill so it is set within a good community. Taking a star away because it's a little run down with some wobbly tables but hey maybe that's why the coffee is cheap (low overhead on decor).,2
review_566871,drinks,"Well, I have mixed reviews about this place! First of all, they have an amazing beer selection! I have only been to one other place that rivals world of beer as far as selection goes. The atmosphere inside the bar was nice, great tv's and a comfortable feel! Can't wait till they open up the seating section upstairs. It was very busy today , but my guess is because it was due to NFL pre-season starting! \nNow the bad! The patio could use a few free standing bistro tables so people have a place to put there beers while having a smoke or socializing outside! As far as inside the bar goes, my only complaint was with the bar staff. Now I realize that it was very busy when I got there, but I was lucky enough to grab a seat at the bar fairly quick, I sat for almost 15 min before someone helped me! I think I counted at least 12 people working behind the bar. With a bar that size there is no reason with that many bartenders and bar backs it should take that long for service, some were playing on there phones, others looked like they were socializing with friends, and a couple bartenders just looked lost! I understand this place is relatively newer and it's going to take some time to work out the kinks! But witnessing a bartender use his pinky as a toothpick and then serve people a beer, with fruit in it, without washing his hands is just unacceptable! And last thing is uniform! Everyone had a world of beer shirt but some people had jeans, khakis, leopard print skirts, per the word \""uniform\"" they failed.Having experience in this industry from a management standpoint I see a lot of things that need to be adjusted! I'll give it a month or two and then stop back in.",2

review_534459,drinks,"I had never reviewed Caliente when it was under the previous ownership and I'm glad I didn't for the new owners, who happen to be awesome.\n\nThe atmosphere is much of what you would expect from a bar.  People jabbering away and TV's in the background with sports, all standard good stuff.  The decor is in the process of changing with the new owners, more cool stuff on the wall and the addition of the chalkboard paint listing all the tap brews (all 20) is really cool.  What makes Caliente welcoming is the staff, none of who I have ever had an issue with... From the handy man to the owners, they know how to treat patrons.\n\nAs for the food, it is pretty damn good.  The pizza is, in my opinion, the best in Bloomfield.  It is obvious that they use fresh ingredients, many of which I believe are local.  The wings are solid and the sandwiches are put on superb bread, which I think makes or breaks most sandwiches.\n\nDrinking!  If you like craft beer then Caliente is your place to go in Bloomfield... The selection on tap is fantastic with Hercules Double IPA, Raging Bitch Belgium IPA and Dogfish Head Burton and Baton only to name a few... There is 20 on tap in total and one will not find a miller lite or bud light in the mix... IF you prefer bottles, well they have two full coolers full of craft brews, including my personal favorite, Dogfish Head 120 Minute IPA...  And for you hipsters, they most certainly have Pabst Blue Ribbon available...\n\nYou can't go wrong with Caliente.",4

review_634084,drinks,"While the title implies a beer selection and it certainly has 3 pages of draft beer of all types and tastes, we were very impressed with our lunch. My girlfriend ordered a pastrami dip and tomato bisque soup and sandwich I had the turkey club with French onion. The sandwiches were ample for a half sandwich special and very tasty. The avocado in the turkey club was a nice addition and the meat was ample. The French onion soup was covered with bread and cheesed sufficiently, not overly salty that can happen with French onion. The Pastrami was plentiful and the dark dipping sauce added a nice flavor. The Tomato bisque also had a nice texture and taste as well. The abundant draft choice drew me in but the food was a pleasant surprise. Compare restaurants in a similar price range and this one should rate highly. In fact we also ate at Carnegies Deli and paid more for a less impressive sandwich. Don't hesitate to try the food here. Will definitely come back here to try all of the beers.",3

But after multiple visits, all I have is an extreme hatred for this dump.  I like little dive bars, but this place is so dirty I always feel like I need a hepatitis shot after leaving!  I've only been during peak hours on the weekend, and it's just packed beyond packed in here.  Everyone smoking their stinky ass cigarettes and sloshing around cheap yellow fizzy beer.  \n\nI swear this place hasn't been cleaned since Monica Lewinsky got her dress stained!  The bathroom is atrocious, I would rank it up there with the dirty bathrooms from the now defunct CBGB or the absolute mess that is passed off as bathrooms at the Clermont Lounge in Atlanta.  I always walk next door now to the Black Door to take my piss instead of risking the AIDS/ring worm amalgam awaiting in Double Down's toilet.  \n\nEvery time I've been the bands performing were about as talented as your average high school garage band.  And I understand Vegas decides to let everyone and their mother smoke in 98% of the establishments which annoys me as a healthy non-smoker.  But damn...this place is just one big Malboro/Camel/Pall Mall cloud!  \n\nTheir signature drinks suck!  Ass Juice tastes like crap!  And the bacon martini...where do I start?  Sure, occasionally I like some bacon....on my breakfast plate next to my eggs and toast.  Not in my beverage!

From what was explained in the tour, the owner wanted to keep everything in a strict fashion as to the way beer is made in Germany. While I didn't really learn anything new on the tour about how beer is made, I have to say that the delivery of the information was the best I've seen. The guy giving the tour was extremely knowledgeable. One thing I did find interesting about the brewery was that they keep their own yeast cultures which isn't something you see a ton of these days.\n\nI tried a flight with an extra tasting on the side so that I could try everything they had available that day. My personal favourite of the day was the Captain Jack. The Domm Kolsch was good also and it was cool to find out that it came from a home brewer who won a contest.\n\nWhile OMB's beers weren't my favourite of the Charlotte breweries I visited I would recommend anyone to come check these guys out.",3

I went early Sat. evening and got wings--garlic parm, greasy and tasteless.  Comes with 2--yes 2 celery pieces, and if u comment on that you will get 2 more pieces, ungraciously handed to you by a surly waiter who looked like he wanted to be anywhere but taking care of customers.  I don't think he smiled once the whole time I was there.  THEN....my meatball sub comes..3 tiny meatballs on a HALF of a hot dog--yes, not hoagie roll but a hot dog bun!  It looked like a kids meal!  Seriously, Subway's $5 footlong is a great deal compared to this!   At least I've never had bad service at Subway!  The manager( ?) came over and said, \""I'm sorry you're not having a good time.\""  Well, to be honest, I was having a fine time, just terrible food!   When I pointed out the measly meatball sub, adding that the beer is great, but the food is less than, she said something like, \""well yeah we are known for our beers, the kitchen is kinda secondary.\""  Ok then maybe you should charge alot less for your kinda secondary food!   Better yet, give it away! To add insult to injury, the bill comes, and instead of comping the sub, like a normal place would do (I took one bite!) they took 1/2 off.  I mean come on...do you want your 3.50 or do you want a satisfied customer who will come back and tell others how the management took good care of you?  So again I called the manager over, again she states (extremely passive aggressive, this one!), \""I'm sorry you're not having a good time.\""  AGAIN, I'm not NOT having a good time, but this is ridiculous.  I didn't eat the sub, what I tasted was terrible, and it's obvious the food is not important here.   She ungraciously agreed to take off the 3.50 and she hopes we will try Hough's again.  Uh, I don't think so, not unless it's JUST for the beer.  But there are plenty of other places in Pittsburgh for great beer and bar food, and nice staff.  It's a shame, because I like to see local places make it, but I don't think you can do that with the kind of food and service I experienced.   Maybe it was an off night, but they were't too busy, it was about 6pm when we got there.  AND this is the second time I've been there, was actually giving it a second try after the first visit a couple of months ago where the small portions of appetizers were greasy and tasteless.  SO..there won't be a third strike!   If they make it on their beers, great, but I won't be supporting them anymore.  Shame.",0

review_504726,drinks,"I ordered the Cool as a Cucumber drink and it was awful. It was really salty. The waitress was kind enough to have it remixed but it wasn't any better. I tried to drink it but just couldn't, so the waitress kindly removed it from our bill when we asked. I also ordered the Tomato, Basil and Garlic pasta and it was spicy yet there is no indication on the description it would be spicy. It is listed as \""spaghetti, fresh tomatoes, sliced garlic,fresh basil, parmesan cheese\"". There was nothing fresh about it. The sauce was canned and there was no basil or garlic. The side order of garlic bread to go with it was a flavorless piece of bread.  Ambiance is nice but the food is nothing to brag about. Sadly I had better food from the food court at the Flamingo.",1
review_467405,drinks,"Delicious mojito.  Super empty compared to normal, chairs up on tables in half the room when we walked in at 5pm seemed like a bad sign.  All the favorites were good except the scallop escargot... Half burnt and half raw does not equate to properly cooked despite the waiter's attempt to say it should be done that way. Hopefully issue rectified in ordering something else.",2

Take a hip coffee place, throw a bunch of Starbucks logos everywhere, and you have this amazingly friendly coffee house. I was anti-Starbucks but now I won't go anywhere else.

I was then disappointed to find out they don't brew decaf all day either and I again have to wait for a pour over. Is it really that big of an issue to brew decaf all day!? Coffee has the largest cost/profit margin, I am sure they can  afford to keep brewed decaf all day. I believe decaf used to be brewed all day. I love this little coffee shop, but am extremely disappointed. I don't have the option to drink the full amount of caffeine because if I did this wouldn't be an issue.",2

review_355184,drinks,"I've frequented my fair share of pubs in Edinburgh. I have to admit, Sandy Bells is one of the more quaint and homey thus far. The outside fa\u00e7ade is fantastic, because it doesn't tend to draw in a whole lot of tourist (just those that read quite a bit on the cities they visit). As a result, you'll get your patrons traditional to a folk music pub: old man, artistic musician and intrigued listeners. \n\nThe music is great with a real jam session type feel. There is no stage, the musicians just sit around a table playing, drinking and chatting as if they are in their own world. \n\nThe drink selection is all right with three rotating taps and standards such as Tennents and Caledonia Best.  The only reason I only gave three stars is the cramped space and lack of seating. The bathrooms weren't too clean either, but then again, it's a traditional pub. That's not much of an issue. \n\n*When you go in be sure to look up. There is some fantastic moulding and a great wooden archway diving the front and back of the pub.",2

Also, they pipe the game audio over the PA for all the big games.\n\nThe beer selection leaves something to be desired, but they almost always have a solid seasonal microbrew, and some Capital on tap. All the lines taste clean now too, which is awesome. They could definitely use some more Wisconsin craft taps though. They have all the staples for you macro lovers though.\n\nPretty friendly townie staff that will give you shit on occasion, so don't come if you have no personality or are easily offended.\n\nFood is pretty decent for bar food, and cheap. The cheese curds are definitely passable, but not the best in town at all. Their pizzas are pretty good too.\n\nSome random notes:\n- The bar stools are pretty uncomfortable, but you forget about it after a few beers.\n- Clientele can be quite interesting sometimes, from stumble drunks to college sorority girls. It's a pretty interesting mix.\n- They don't charge extra if you forget to close out your tab at the end of the night.\n- Good drink specials\n- The reviews on here from 2010 and earlier don't really apply anymore, since they remodeled the entire place. \n- Awesome spot to watch sports.\n\nFin.",3

review_408399,drinks,"I appreciate the third wave coffee shops that have popped up in the valley over the last couple of years. I love what Cartel, Press, Echo, et. al are doing for the coffee culture. Cartel has the best Iced Toddy I've tasted, Echo the best pour over and most consistently bright latte art, and Press wins the \""most knowledgeable barista\"" award. \n\nBut I take issue with the way in which Giant is attempting to do this. \n\nI have worked in three coffee shops with varying degrees of coffee cred, and I appreciate the spectrum of a coffeebar menu--from drip, pour over, french press, espresso. I don't drink Starbucks, but appreciate their role in the second wave introduction of coffee to Americans--especially in the 90's.\n\nTwice I have gone to Giant in an attempt to get my favorite summertime coffee beverage. Two shots of espresso with a little chocolate and half and half shaken over ice. The result is a wonderfully frothy, refreshingly sweet cup of love. \n\nThe first time I went in I was frankly told that \""No, I can't do that for you.\""  No further explanation. No lengthy lecture about how the ice \""shocks\"" the espresso. No discussion of the integrity of the espresso. After this, I shrugged my shoulders, ordered a double espresso. Sure, I was impressed with the sparkling water (as I would receive in Europe)  I was given as a refreshing cap-off to my beverage, but it wasn't what I originally ordered. So, then, unsatisfied, I attempted to order my other summertime staple: an iced toddy. It was different, sweeter, nuttier than I'd had in awhile and I appreciated its character.  Luckily for me, the cranky barista who refused my order had left, so I went back up to ask about their toddy; what kind of beans they used, how long they let it cold brew, etc. It is a mix of all their beans, the girl said. \""Do you like it?\"" she asked. \""Yes!\"" I said. \""Oh,\"" she said, \""I forgot, we also pre-sweeten it.\"" No wonder. It's interesting that they sweeten their toddy, but won't serve me my drink. \n\nThe second time the gentleman listened to what I wanted and, again, I was told that they can't do it. I was told that they \""respect the fragility of the espresso\"" and \""we serve our espresso in a more traditional manner.\""  At least I was given a reason, and I respect that. \n\n But let me contrast this with my experience at Press Coffee. \n\nAt the bottom of Press' menu they have a little sign that reads \""if you don't see your drink, ask us.\""\n\nSo, one day, I did. And the barista listened to my request and giddily told me that he'd gladly make my drink, and beyond that, it would probably be the best one I've ever had. \""Why do you think it will be the best one I've ever had?\"" I asked.  He told me that Press believes that all of their ingredients are the best of the best and that any combination of them will produce a superior tasting drink. When I told him what Giant did (without naming names), he went above his call of duty in order to try and educate me (a critical phase of the the third wave). He defended Giant--he felt that protecting a beans integrity is important, while using this as an opportunity to talk about how third wave shops need to do a better job not alienating customers who have unique tastes. \n\nI understand that Giant is not alone in refusing drink orders:\n\nhttp://andiamnotlying.com/2008/murky-coffee-arlington-hold-that-espresso-between-your-knees/\n\nBut I am not that obnoxious customer who doesn't understand espresso. I'm an ally, someone looking to refine my tastes, expand my understanding of coffee and the third wave. I can't tell you how much I appreciate baristi like those at Press. They're the ones who are going to \""convert\"" the Starbucks drinkers, and, ultimately, conquer the world's coffee tastes. If Giant doesn't change their attitude I'm afraid their going to alienate a growing base of customers looking for top-quality coffee.",1
review_234485,drinks,"First off, sign up to be a card member (even if you don't want to gamble, DO IT). Then go for a lunch buffet. You get $5 off of $12.99 so you basically pay like $8. \n\nFirst dish I go for is their salad (this is a weird habit of mine that I always start off with salad). Their salad selection is decent. They basically have everything you need. I added romaine greens with tomatoes, onions, mushrooms, olives, and beets with Ranch. On my way back, I also get their clam chowder. It was VERY VERY salty. Also, it lacked a lot of potatoes. However, there were a lot of baby clams (I guess to make up for their lack of potatoes). \n\nMy second round, I try their porridge (because I'm asian I just had, to). It was terrible. It was too wattery and had a ton load of msg. I'm used to homemade porridge without msg, so I have an especially good taste bud for msg. Bottom line, don't get it. \n\nMexican selection: overall not bad. I think it was the best out of the other cuisines. I tried their chicken enchilada which was very tasty. Their carnitas were also good, tender and moist but again, VERY salty. Interestingly though, they had no guacamole... How can they not have guacamole?!?!\n\nAsian selection: The typical asian dishes. I tried their orange chicken. At least this tasted better than Panda Express ... Potsticker was alright. The stuffing (not even sure what was inside) was just ok ... They had a lot of fried food in this section. Bottom line, as an asian person, I think their noodles was the best thing there.\n\nPizza: They had like 3 different types of pizza (pepperoni, mushroom, and cheese). I tried their cheese. It was decent. Looking at the three types, I can see that they lacked toppings though.\n\nThai: A good variety of curry. I tried their yellow shrimp curry because it was the most worth it. Basically a lot of peeled shrimp with curry. I would recommend getting this.\n\nTri tip/Pork belly: Make sure you ask the carver for the good side. I got my meat rare. Had a very good meat taste with loads of juice. So good .... Pork belly was better though. Although very fatty, the skin was so crunchy and meat was moist. \n\nMongolian: This section is pretty good because you can create your own noodle with whatever veggies they have and with a choice of three meats (chicken, pork, and beef). even though I was super full, I had to give this a try. With my stir fried noodle, I added onion, mushroom, bean sprout, chicken, and a spoonfuls of garlic. The chef cooked it in front of me. The final product smelled SO good. It was probably due to the amount of garlic I put. Bottom line, try this section. You can add however amount you want, so no lose here.\n\nFinally, we move on to their desert. Tiramisu was small which was perfect size. I like it. It was sweet but not overly sweet. Lastly, I also had their flan. It was also small but a perfect size. The flan tasted similar to their creme brulee. \n\nIn conclusion: It was just an OK buffet. Nothing to die for. But for the price I paid ($8) it was well worth the selection. If I had to pay full price I'd be 50/50 about coming here. Overall, Palms is pretty off the strip so who would wanna go off the strip to come here? But I guess if you were to stay around here, this isn't a bad place. I would give this place a 3 star, BUT because they had unlimited red wine, chardonnay, and beer for what I paid, I gave this place a 4 star.\n***Their serving spoon was pretty dirty. So there were many times my hands would be greasy. \n***A lot of their food was salty for some reason.",3

review_513648,drinks,"This review is for coffee and the pastries. \n\nI came in with Amelinda L. and Teresa S. last week after we had just grabbed dinner at View Wine Bar. After walking in, we were informed by one of the staff members that some of the pastries were 1/2 off. Great. As we took a closer look at the cakes and tarts at the counter, we were appalled to see a lot of not-so-hot looking little guys there. We're talking smudged frosting, and fruit that had been sitting out too long, i.e. strawberries that were shriveling and browning, plus a dried kiwi. Oh wait, no, it's just a kiwi slice that has seen better days.\n\nWhen looking at the pastries we asked a couple questions:\n\nUs: What is this pastry here? \nGuy: Uh...this is the caramel, and this is the strawberry, and I'm not sure (runs off to ask a coworker)\nGirl (who swoops in): That's a caramel, this is the strawberry chocolate, and that's the chocolate. It's my favorite!\n\nI love nondescriptive answers! Thanks for the enlightenment. Like I couldn't figure it out by the caramel drizzle, the strawberry sitting atop the second choice, and the chocolate garnish on the third. \n\nWorst of all, the conversation when ordering went like this:\n\nMe: I'd like two Nutella cappuccinos and the pumpkin latte - all medium size please.\nThe same guy as earlier: Um, what size do you want the latte?\nMe: A medium? \nGuy: OK\nMe: I'd also like the strawberry chocolate cake and the carrot cake.\nGuy: OK\nMe: How much are those?\n---Guy runs off to check, and at this time the girl in the front proceeds to tell me again that some of the pastries were 1/2 off---\n\nTerrible. Hot mess express. When I pointed out that some of the tarts were severly dried out to the girl, she said \""No, those are fine!\"" What a lie! Seriously, is this amateur hour?

review_110027,drinks,"First: This is the tallest restaurant I've ever been to.\n\nSecond: They give pretty generous servings of beer in ironically tall glasses. Their wines are pretty good too.\n\nThird: Mr. Biersch's brewery and eatery, when it comes down to it, is really just a fancy version of BJ's minus the flatscreens projecting the latest sports event. The food isn't that great. Most American food restaurants fit within the nexus of the TGIFriday's scale: a fancy version of TGIFriday's being the best, Normal TGIFriday's being just TGIFriday's, and Poor Man's TGIFriday's being something like Denny's. This spot falls into the fancier version of TGIFriday's. You get the picture. I ordered a veggie pizza which literally was a thin-crust pizza that someone dumped a bowl of spinach on top after it came out of the oven. It's how a jock understands vegetarian eating.\n\nFourth: The staff is really friendly, but ultimately really busy because they're understaffed. It's probably related to our nation's clusterfuck to the poor house, but I think it's a restaurant's job to make sure that the customers are seen to.\n\nFifth: Their food is overpriced for what it is.\n\nSixth: This place isn't that bad, it just has no soul. It is what it is. You go for a burger, you go to drink, or you go to watch a game. Maybe a combination of all three.\n\nSeventh: If you're a diehard about this place, at some point in your dining life your idea of class was probably something along the lines of drinking champagne in Hooters.",1

review_407052,drinks,"Looking for a little chaos and confusion with your morning coffee?  Ordering an espresso-based drink to go, should be easy and straightforward. Not today. The new approach now, is to order your coffee at the cocktail bar, the person taking the order then shouts the order across the room to another person standing at the coffee counter, who then relays the order to the barista. When I questioned the very confusing new idea, it was explained that they are now going to table service...huh???\nI understand the owner's scramble to create a unique and individual experience in light of the opening of yet another \""Big Green,\"" a block away. I appreciate her creative approach to her business, but today was an absolute joke.\nIt took 13 minutes to get my cappuccinos to go, and there was only 1 other order in front of me. There is rarely any consistency, and the barista's have not been adequately trained, at least with respect to a proper cappuccino. They are more concerned with the craze of pretty foam-art than the centuries old, proper cappuccino of 1/3 espresso, 1/3 milk, 1/3 foam.\nI wish Urban Beans all the success, but after 3 years of patronage, I'm afraid I have to say Ciao.",1

review_47387,drinks,"HAPPY HOUR REVIEW:\n\nWe came here on the Friday of Labor Day weekend. The food was just okay and not very memorable.  There really isn't a Happy Hour menu at Four Peaks.  As it was explained to us, \""the drinks are $1.00 off and the food is just the regular prices.\""   \n\nThis is the sort of thing you run into at Craft Brewers that serves food.  A lot of times they confuse their beer sales, as proof of their food success.  It's too bad they don't eat here.\n\nAMBIANCE/MOOD:\nVery, very noisy and somewhat overly attentive service, particularily from those busing tables.\n\nMENU:\nEverything under the sun, but nothing that stands out:\nChicken Rolls $7; Spinach Artichoke Dip $8; Garlic Cheese Beer Bread $6; Cheese Puffs $7; Spanekopita $7; Wings $7; Nachos $7; Quesadilla $7; Thai Hummus $6; Stuffed Poblano $8; Chicken Strips & Fries $8; Pub Fish and Chips $9; Chicken Enchiladas $9; Carne Adovada $10 and various pizzas starting at $13.50\n\nSERVICE:\nAs noted above, they are overly attentive, including their over the top busers. They seem to excel at taking your plates before you have finished your food. LOL.  No, it's actually not funny.\n\nFOOD:\nFour Peaks is a Craft/ Micro brewer http://www.craftbeer.com/breweries/brewery-locator/find-a-us-brewery  who uses the restaurant to sell their beer.  Now, normally that isn't a bad thing. Except the food here is uninspiring at best.  RAM, Rock Bottom, Yard House, Gordon Biersch, BJs all do it quite well, but these are restaurants concepts trying to sell food and beer, in that order.\n\nWe tried their  Spanekopita, which they describe as a blend of cheeses, spinach, pine nuts, and dill rolled in phyllo dough and served with marinara sauce. We actually liked this very much and would recommend it.  \n\nOn the other hand, their Five Layer Nachos was a big miss. It came out cold and you could peal the cheese off the nacho chips. We added chicken ($2.50) which looked like it came out of a Sysco bag and dropped on top before serving. Ugh.\n\nAs you would expect, the beer at Four Peaks is very much Four Stars.  We enjoyed their Oatmeal Stout and their 8th Street Scottish Ale, both of which had low IBUs and 4.8-5.2% alcohol.  \n\nPRICES:\nExpect to pay around $40 including tax and tip, depending on how many pints you are going to enjoy.",1

The pub is generally filled with locals, and if you go in during the afternoon, most of them are drunk and looking at you in a really sleazy way - not nice.\n\nMost of the time the staff have been friendly, but occasionally there are some workers who completely fail to acknowledge your presence and you can be stood waiting at the bar for ages to be served.

We've been here a handful of times (maybe 5?) and have been disappointed every time.  While the beer selection is great, the prices are simply outrageous.  A 22oz specialty beer for $19?  I've found the same beers at around $12-$14 in other spots.\n\nOur experience with the food is limited.  The only thing we've tried is the fried zucchini, but it was pretty awful.  Limp, flavorless mush with a side of marinara that was basically just plain tomato sauce.  We have avoided their pizzas on the assumption that the same sauce is used.\n\nDespite the over-priced beer and mediocre food, we may have continued to pop in from time to time, but for our 2 most recent experiences which made me feel like the management/ownership of this place is just downright dishonest.  Caliente has taken to advertising pint nights (buy a beer, keep the glass).  The first one we tried to go to, we got there around 9:45, and were informed that they were out of glasses.  They said the special started at 7.  OK, that's not unreasonable.  So the next time, we got there around 7:20.  What do you know?  Out of glasses.  The manager looked at me and said, \""They go fast!\""  That may be true, but then: get more glasses!  I don't need free glassware to patronize a place, but I do find it extremely insulting when a business advertises something like this to get you through the door, then doesn't deliver.  Running out of a special in 20 minutes isn't a special - it's a fire sale.  The beer selection may be good, but we won't be going back.",0

review_508056,drinks,"I stopped by this morning to pick up a latte and a muffin on my way to work - it was around 10am, so long after the morning rush (if there is such a thing in Harrisburg). I waited and waited and waited for about 5 minutes for the barista to stop flirting with a customer who was in front of me - they were basically just chatting - then I threw up my arms and left. I want to support local business as much as the next guy, but at least I know if I walk into a Starbucks, I can get in and out in 5 minutes.\n\nSkip this place, if you have anywhere to be. Got time to waste? This is just the place.",0
review_456765,drinks,"Its about time this place got put on blast.\n\nIf you go to this venue for one of their events, in my case \""What Happened Wednesday?\"", you will be severely disappointed. Repping drink specials at $3 for well drinks, draft, and bottled beers, you couldn't really go wrong. Until it comes to the point of closing your tab. When I did go to check out, I was charged nearly $30 for a 3 drink tab. If we all get our math done correctly, this comes to around $9. Unfortunately for everyone in the place, you happened to select a drink where if you're a pretty girl, you're charged $3. Otherwise, you're coughing up $9 a pop. Not to mention that you're charged for a drink you didn't even purchase (I was charged for 4 drinks, and only purchased 3).\n\nI'm not one to complain about rip-offs, if you go to a bar normally you should know what to expect. But this was RIDICULOUS. My only advice, ask a bartender how much you are going to be charged for a drink before you order it. I may sound cheap, but I'd at least like to know what I'm paying for. \n\n1 star for being a joke of a bar.",0

Although it is conveniently located down the street from place, it has continued to offer sub-par service for the past 5 months. While the staff is...mostly...friendly, they are very unprofessional and spend more time openly talking to eachother about their personal lives than to me. As for drinks, 9 times out of 10 my order is made wrong. Iced coffee sweetened with cream? How do I end up with everything BUT that? Not to mention they've forgotten my food order multiple times and I've had to ask for it again.  I wish I could say it was just me but my boyfriend usually stops by on his way to work and has just as bad a time. \nManager, please save your store!",1
review_100984,drinks,"A great place to have a few drinks during the week (they have awesome specials on drink and food).   The bartenders and staff are very friendly and extremely accomadating.  The place has a nice laid back ambiance.  Come as you are...sandals, tshirts, hoody..whatever.   They have a jukebox and serve grub till 2am.  This is my local favorite.  I would give it 5 stars, but sometimes there is a slight douche factor in the clientele is to be expected per the location smack dab in the center of old town.  Check this place out for a quick drink or just to hang out and relax in the sun.\n\n\n\nUpdate: 3/2013\n\nThis place has gone downhill steadily over the past year or 2 since new management.  The majority of all the cool bartenders have quit or moved on..as a result alot of the regulars (like myself) dont come here nearly as much as they used to.  While it is still a cool place during the day for a cocktail, its no longer my first choice for a hangout at night.  Maybe its just that im sick of spring training?  The upper bar is my choice if i do happen to come by for a pre-show cocktail. Its usually a little easier to get a drink upstairs and the atmosphere is a tiny bit more relaxed.  Overall, its still a pretty decent place for a drink and some good folks still work here, but id much rather go to Pattys, coachhouse, pranksters, or grapevine.",2

It could have been a place where i spent hours reading the paper, eating delicious french pastries from the place down the street living out a real life Pittsburgh version of that show Friends. But here's the thing. I ordered a latte and it was bad. Espresso was bad, steamed milk was bad, proportions were bad, the whole thing was just bad. I will go back a couple times to make sure this wasn't a fluke but if there's one thing I cant abide in a coffee shop, it's bad coffee.",1

The service is good as well, my server was very helpful and accomodated us in everyway.  \n\nI agree with some of the other reviews about the inside atmosphere; its not so enticing.

The crowd was a little older than you would find around places like Commonwealth and Gold Spike on a Saturday. \n\nI thoroughly enjoyed the live music. The part I really enjoyed? The singing bartenders! I thought it was cool that the bartenders sang background music for the person performing, but then one of the bartenders went up and sang a couple of songs. It was definitely different than the surrounding bars. The bartender also sang really well! My friend and I finished our beers, but we decided to continue to sit and enjoy the music. \n\nIf you need a little break from the crowded area around, I would definitely recommend this one!\n\nThe prices are pretty average. We paid about $6 for a beer, it's not a place that will break your wallet.",4

Then, a salad and salmon burger to share. The salad was really one of the sadder things we have ever seen. Lots of lettuce, little to no toppings, and the grilled portobello mushroom was small and shriveled, rather than plump and juicy. The salmon burger was fine, but nothing to write home about.

The waitstaff has been very helpful and friendly, and although they (understandly) can't speak with authority about all of their beers, they were always willing to get me one of the owners - who are beer gurus - to answer my questions.  I finally got to try a sour/wild beer on tap!!\n \nThe weather is so nice this time of year, and I love it when they have their big garage door open - which also helps the sound level quite a bit.\n \nThe homemade poptart is a fantastic, fluffly, baked puffed pastry with delicious filling and cream cheese frosting - think a gormet toaster strudle.  The ketchup is very interesting since it is made in-house and its nice to actually taste that tomato flavor.  I NEED to try their fluffernutter (peanut butter + marshmall fluff) next.",3

review_303231,drinks,"I was recently at Cartel Coffee Lab and ordered myself a small-size AeroPress Coffee. To my surprise, this small \""kiddy\"" size coffee set me back by $3. As I started consuming the AeroPress famous Cartel Coffee, I began to wonder why does Cartel Coffee charge $3 for a coffee, when the often ridiculed and the supposedly overpriced chain called Starbucks offers the same size coffee for $1.75? \n\nAnd my AeroPress Cartel coffee wasn't itself that great; I mean I've had coffee of different roasts before, and I'm no coffee connoisseur, but Cartel coffee felt very watery and very plain. It was just like the pedestrian coffee I have sometimes at work.\n\nThis place charges $3 for a coffee because Coffee Cartel thinks it's cool; it feels you're obliged to pay for its super-cool chilled out austere interior; it feels you need to pay up for all the nonsensical writing that's scribbled over its walls; moreover it feels you need to experience the pathetic service it that prides itself on.

review_360933,drinks,"The joy of a tiki bar is escaping the madness of the day to day life.... I needed a break from the Vegas Strip. Frankie's scratched that itch perfectly. On a scale of 1 - Elvis: the drinks = Chuck Berry, Atmosphere = Elvis (early 70s, sweaty but still kicking butt). I forget the bartender's name, but he was awesome at navigating my haole co-workers to libations that fall in the more familiar shores for their tastes. This helped extinguish any mutiny that might have occured in our crew  due to me dragging them 20 minutes from the hotel. \n\nI would absolutely take the time to go back next time I pass through Vegas. The cheap drinks offset any cab fare you pay to get out there. They were cheaper than that well-liquor crap the casinos dish out. I also got a fist bump for being a tourist taking the time to come out to Frankie's. How about that? Also, it seems locals call it \""Frankie's\"" and the cab driver got confused when we called it by its full name.",3

And hey, who doesn't like new partners in crime?\n\nThe decor was a great compliment to the night of sexy pretentiousness that preceded it. The couches were fairly comfortable. I loved the exposed brick, the low lighting, the fixtures, the movies, and the music. Speaking of music, songs from the Fugees album The Score were on frequently throughout the night making me want to listen to the whole album so badly that when I got back to my car I spent 10 minutes digging through my glove box to find my copy. I'm still listening to it today.\n\nThe service was pretty damn skippy from what I saw. I never had to get up to get my own drink thanks to my amazing friends, but I always seemed to get them quickly. \n\nThe drinks I had were very well made. On the suggestion of the bartender I tried a White Rabbit and also had a lemon drop shot. I usually am put off by chocolate based drinks as I'm not a huge chocolate fan and they always taste fake, but the White Rabbit delivered. I could drink it in a gallon pitcher. With a big bendy straw. And an umbrella. The lemon drop was the best I've had. \n\nWhat do I wish was better?\n\nI'd love to see Frambroise *and* Guinness on tap so I could have a red velvet made (my favorite beverage).

When I did get a seat it took quite awhile to get greeted.  When I finally got some service, he informed me that they were supposed to have 6 servers, 2 bartenders, a busser, and a hostess; but there was only 2 servers.  Needless to say service was slow the entire night, but I gave the guy the benefit of the doubt the entire night.  He seemed so frazzled that he got to the point of not caring anymore, I really did feel bad for him.\n\nThe atmosphere was a cool outdoor bar with a bunch of rescue birds.  That is where the birds were cool.  The place had the slight tinge of urea smell (bird poo smell) & squawking birds which got so bad at one point it sounded like one was being waterboarded and giving birth.  \n\nThe beer selection was good & they actually server their Moscow Mules (and their several variants of it) in the copper mug, big plus for me.  This category was 4 stars!\n\nFinally was the food.  My friend got a Margarita Pizza, it looked kind of blah.  She said it did not taste that great.  I ordered the Perch burger w/ tater tots.  The tots were soooo greasy.  They left a snail trail where they were sitting on the paper.  The burger was initially great, but this is where the big problem happened, there was a used twisty tie in my burger.  When I alerted the server, he removed the twisty tie with his bare hand (it had just been in my mouth) and walked off with it.  When he came back he let me know the management would give me a free drink. I worked in the industry for almost 4 years and I would have comped an entire bill if that occurred to my table, especially with all the other BS that was going on.   IT ended up being a $47 tab, it was his loss because if he comped the whole check I would have given him the entire thing as a tip.  Instead he got 25%.\n\n\nWill I be back?  Not at all likely.  Think this was a one and done for me.  I highly recommend trying something else in downtown Chandler, there are plenty of other options.",0

None of us enjoy flying, so we stopped in to have a few drinks before the flight.  First off, the service was terrible.  We didn't even have a server greet us for 15 minutes.  Then it took her another 15 minutes to bring our drinks back.  After being there for a bit, we ordered food...which took about 45 minutes.  While eating, one of my friends asked for a water and the waitress came out with another beer for her instead of a water?!?  When we were done we asked for the bill, and the waitress disappeared for over 30 minutes and then when she came back we had to ask her for it again.  It was ridiculous.  Anyway...When the bill came I was shocked that my bill was $65.00 for just myself.  For 3 house margaritas (standard size) it was $45.00!  That is crazy that a pint glass margarita is $15.00. \n\nCrappy service, food wasn't great, and it was way overpriced.",0
review_27876,drinks,"This dark dive has been around for a long time. I have many memories here. After my college graduation, instead of having a big party with lots of people, I chose to go here with my husband and day drink. :)\n\nThe bartenders are always very friendly and the drinks are usually very cheap but... I would ask about the price of certain pitchers of beer before purchasing one. Certain brands are shockingly pricey. Other than that great bar to just hang out and have some good times with friends.",3
review_330760,drinks,"The gelato here is out of this world! I can't say much about the chocolates themselves; they're highly priced and something I haven't had cause to buy. But we always come here for gelato when we're on Saint-Denis--whether it is July or January. I think the chocolate-based flavors are better than the others, but I don't think I've ever had gelato here that I didn't like. \n\nRecommended--if you can find the place. Suite 88 is one of those little shops that is never exactly where I thought it was, and I end up wandering up and down Saint-Denis, laboring to find the correct cross-street!",3

review_201762,drinks,"I was not at all impressed with this Bar and Lounge. First off, it's one of the smallest Lounge I have ever been too! Especially in Vegas! I have been to bigger and better lounges such as V Bar or Blush.\n\nThe only good thing about this place is the fact there is no cover and no lines. But again, I think there are other lounges that also don't have a cover and are bigger and better. \n\nThe music was ok. They played a lot of oldies in my opinion. The place wasn't even that packed considering it's such a tiny room. Alcohol was average price - $8-$12 a pop. \n\nEh it was just a small place to chill at. I wouldn't necessarily go here again. Nothing about it was special and it was just blah to me.",0

How deceitful! Definitely regret my experience here.",0

Now compared to other bars like Tailgaters the same order of food plus a bucket of beers and 4 Malibu n Cokes = $45 with food being just as good. So if you want bar food this is not the place to go.

review_414832,drinks,"The wine was great. The bar was super cute and the patio was awesome.\n\nOur service was nothing short of horrendous. Our waitress would rarely come check on us, and when she did she would walk away before we had a chance to speak. We asked for a bottle of wine then brought us glasses. After reminding her that we wanted the bottle she was reluctant to come up with a solution to her mistake. Her initial response was something to the effect of \""I just filled the glasses you drank out of, so I can't take them back.\"" After discussing it she told us that she would comp four glasses of wine and charge for the bottle. Seemed fair to us, so we were more than happy to work with her.\n\nThen came the check. Overcharged us and overcharged our friends. When I brought it to her attention she got extremely snippy and told us that she had said she would comp our NEXT four glasses of wine. Since we only had three glasses each (the two we ordered initially, then the two we had that were supposed to be the bottle rather than the four each she claimed) it didn't exactly make sense. There was no attempt to recover from her awful service, all she did was argue with us while the manager sat and watched. \n\nI'd love to try 5th and Wine on a different night, but if this server comes near our table I'm out.",0
review_49130,drinks,"I come here 4 days a week. Great staff. Not really much you can say about a coffee shop. Prices are reasonable and they have a punch card (10 drinks, get one for $1). I think that is kind of dumb though. I buy 10 drinks at approximately $4 then I am spending $40. Why can't I get a free drink? You're really going to charge me a buck? Regardless, I keep coming back. My one MAJOR complaint is their internet really stinks. Some days it barely works. Sadly, that is why I will go there when I don't need my internet and will visit their competitor down the street (Xtreme Bean) when I need to use my computer. If they had solid internet I would probably live there and it would definitely be 5 stars! \n\nP.S. Sometimes you can catch the Subway connection from next door and it is better!",3

I asked the owner where they got the gelato from and she said they made it there!   A very nice selection of flavors also.  It was hard to decide but she offered us samples of any flavor we wanted before we decided.    If you are in the neighborhood, it's worth a stop!",4

While I really like the lime-basil combination and malt ball flavors, I went with classic vanilla bean- how CAN you go wrong with that?? You cant.\n\nAnyhow I will probably be back to try something a little bit more tart and tangy, maybe right now is a good idea as its 111 outside.\nI love how this place is right down the street from me and didnt know about till a few weeks ago. ah!",3

The drag shows are always entertaining and the karaoke DJ always takes care of us.  And don't forget about the monthly alternatives they offer , like Bearacuda!  If you are looking for a club, go somewhere else.  But if you are looking for a great time, hit this place up!  I'd give it ten stars if I could!",4
review_525197,drinks,"Stopped by Casablanca Lounge on a Thursday night. First impression was it's very hard to find. Upon entering, a great looking room with awesome patios. I like to think of myself as a cocktail enthusiast. The cocktail menu read well and a couple of drinks really stood out. Had their seasonal mule and a couple of shots of whiskey that were harder to find in the valley. Bartenders were great and happy with the drinks. Then the music went on, we had migrated to the patio to enjoy a wonderful AZ night and were blasted by distorted and terrible guitarist / vocalist. I really wanted to throw him a fish! We lasted about 4 songs then tabbed out and left after we couldn't bare the musical ear infection anymore. As we left we realized how awful the music really was, we heard 2 more groups on the street comment on where that awful music is coming from. All in all, Place is cool. Drinks and bar staff great. Minus one star for location and signage. Almost minus two but just one star for music. Maybe they were just entertaining one of their investors and letting his son play or something!",2

Go to Dieu du Ciel or L'Amer a Boire if you want good beer in Montreal.\n\nA friend and I were in Montreal for the weekend and looking for some good local beers (as we always do). This street was close to our hotel and had alot of night spots on it, so first two night we went there, and on the second one ended up at this place.\n\nWe had two good beers there, the rest ranged from less than impressive to horrible. The good ones were a non-house Hemp beer (that reminded me of a rauch bier but with hemp smell instead of wood smoke) and their house Honey Brown. We also had some sort of stout that was passable but not good, and a god-aweful Framboise that my friend said tasted like soap.\n\nWe nearly gave up on the beer scene in Montreal until we met a very friendly bar tender at Pub L'ile Noire that set us on the right path.",1

As we frolicked through the in' s and out's of there distilling methods I soon came to realize I have stumbled upon the \""holy grail\"" and felt as if there were angel babies swimming in my mouth.  Of course I felt this way only after tasting the pure taste of bourbon.   But not just any bourbon.  Bourbon made from angel babies.  Babies that people who have seen Willy Wonkas movies would call Oompa Loompas.

However, my husband and I shared a very small sampling (4) of their caramels.  The assortment had blood orange (my favorite of the 4), bee pollen, dulce de leche, and maple.  I didn't care for the bee pollen... aka honey.  Maple was uneventful, no discernable flavor, to be honest.  The dulce de leche was really good, though.  We also bought some of their milk chocolate toffee.  It was good, but I've had better to be honest.  I really liked the blood orange chocolate caramel, though.  It had a strong orange aftertaste, and in caramel, made it really unique.  Just to give you an idea of pricing, 4 caramels plus a small box of toffee cost me $29.

Once we found out we had to pay for it, we decided to come here instead.\n\nThe bar area was pretty busy and there was a long wait for a table so we decided to stay at the bar.

I originally wanted the fish and chips but they were out (how does that even happen? I thought this was a \""pub\""?!). The sandwich was okay, nothing to write home about. I thought the bread could have been toasted; definitely tasted like something was missing. \n\nDrinks were mainly beer and carbombs the whole night, it being St. Patrick's Day and all. Normally carbombs are in a huge glass of Guiness and you drop a full shot of Jameson with a touch of Bailey's but this came in the smallest cup you could imagine.

I really like that it's self serve so I can do exactly what I want with the large number of different ice cream flavors (10ish) and topping options (50ish). What really sets this place apart is that the frozen yogurt actually tastes good. The butterfinger fro yo (my favorite) really does taste like a butterfinger bar. The salted caramel and cupcake batter are also exceptional. The self pick toppings are out of this world. There is all the fresh fruit you could want, but who wants fresh fruit when ever chocolate bar and baked good is available for you to mix in?! Heath bar, crushed butterfinger, twix, snickers, reeses peanut butter cups, M&M's, reeses pieces, peanut M&M's, moon pies, donuts, cookie dough, etc etc etc. It really is other wordly. Then there is every sauce option - caramel, chocolate, peanut butter, nutella, cake frosting, marshmallow, butterscotch, etc etc etc. It really is heaven.

review_482964,drinks,"When a new spot in the downtown/north central Phoenix area opens up, we historic district folks get quite excited...still too few choices, and too few great choices at that.  So, I was very happy to hear a friend say she went to The Living Room for an after work gathering and really liked it.  We went back last night with friends for happy hour.  We literally were screaming to hear each other across a small 4-top, and asked three times--nicely--for the music level to be turned down a smidge.  Here's the thing:  we all agreed we'd make this a go-to spot in the 'hood for happy hour and easy weeknight dinners.  But, if they don't get the sound level/ambience right, it's going to be hard for them to gain a solid and loyal following.  Shared a cheese plate and hummus app...all good.  Martinis and beers, good.  Service, decent.  Living Room has some strong pluses, but sound level is going to make it or break it.  Love a place feeling alive and full of energy, just not fun when you can't hear to have good conversation with the folks sitting at your table.  After just over an hour of the ridiculous shouting, we left and went to Tuck Shop for a wonderful, fun, delicious dinner with our friends ($90 plus tip that Living Room lost).  So, Living Room, are you a DJ-driven music spot wanna-be or a neighborhood wine cafe and lounge? (A nod to Postino for getting the sound/food/ambience mix just right.)",1
review_86725,drinks,"This coffee is absolute shit. I don't want to mince words here--this was simply awful.\n\nAs I was walking to the library, I thought about my review--I was initially going to give it 2 stars, but as my walk wore on, I decided against it. Warning: This will be an irritated review.\n\nI walked into Espresso Royale and was immediately stuck waiting at the counter for several minutes as the barista changed milk jugs very, very slowly. Then, there was little customer service or niceness as this faux hipster gave me my cup of coffee.\n\nLook--it's okay to be a rude, pretentious hipster if your coffee is amazing--which is why Bradbury's is awesome--but Espresso Royale? The coffee was horrendous. Thin, watery and poorly balanced...this is some of the worst coffee I've tasted. Honestly, you'd be better off going to McDonald's or--dare I say--a gas station. At least the service will be halfway-decent.\n\nI will not be going back here--not for the crap service, and especially not for the coffee.",0

review_634576,drinks,"On my last visit to Vegas I stopped in for a drink and then came back again for the food and again with a co-worker. This place is great! The ambiance is modern and relaxed, the staff is great, the drinks are amazing, and the food is delicious. Coming from the strip, the value for the price is excellent. I mean, if you want ridiculous value then go to Taco y Taco, but if you want value for high quality food then this place has that. My favorite dish is the shrimp and lobster mac 'n cheese, which is a full meal. On my third visit I had the pizza with the sausage, pepperoni, onions, and mushrooms (I don't recall the name) and it was very good. I see other reviews about the margarita pizza and I've heard the same, so I'm sure they'll fix it. They are new, so when you stop in ask, since they're in improvement mode. I don't even think they've had their grand opening yet. The mixed drinks are high quality and the bottled beer selection is a great mix of craft and specialty beers along with a few go-to beers if you're not a beer person. My advice, go there now; it's only a matter of time before you'll need to make a reservation or wait in line. I'll definitely go back on my next visit.",4

My friends both got the amaretto. I got 2 scoops, one grape [which I can never find grape ice cream or gelato anywhere] and the other blackberry. Both were so good that my friends ended up eating some of mine after theirs was gone. The gelato also even had bits and pieces of real fruit in it. We will all definitely be back and SOON! \n\nPlus they have wifi! Perfect for studying with a side of fresh gelato.",4

With that being said, booze are cheap, place is broken down like a older Van Buren street walker but well, the booze are cheap. \n\nWent in during one of their better drinking days with some buddies because of the $1 you-call-its...$5 dollar admission for guys...sucks but if you drink enough then the cover charge pays for it self. Has a patio for smoking, parking is pretty plentiful since everyone walks there since they're gonna be crawling out due to cheap booze. Haven't tried the food since I was on a alcohol diet so I can't comment on it. \n\nIs this place kid friendly? No. Is this a place to get messed up on the cheap? Yes. \n\nBring your friends so they can help carry you out if you go on the days of the $1 you-call-its.",2

I don't normally drink coffee so they served me up an enormous glass of iced green tea and a huge cupcake from the case.

The prices were nightclub expensive and considering it's an off strip bar, I kind of assumed they would be a little better priced, but oh well. I can't imagine coming here too often for that reason alone. While we were there they couldn't seem to figure out the dimmers on the lights and they kept flipping on and off but overall we had a nice time here. Service was very attentive as well.",2

review_566937,drinks,"With all the microbrew swirl out there you have to beware of places like World of Beer. Read the menu for the prices for sure! At 11:00pm on a Saturday NO FOOD could be bought! That is illegal in many states and increases drunkenness. From what I have seen here Arizona loves the drunk drivers! Lots of revenue! Why would they want to decrease the tons of money they are making here. I have lived in 16 states and AZ is the worse (Connecticut you are #2). Did I say watch those prices? The most I have ever paid for a pint of beer was $7.75 and that was a Southern Tier Pumpkin Pie, hands down my favorite. I just moved here from the microbrew capital of America, Portland, OR. You pay $4.50-$5.50 a pint there, sometimes $6.00. I chose the beer the yuppy guy next to me liked and it was fair, but unimaginative. When the bill came that beer was $9.00 a pint!! NINE DOLLARS! WTF! I complained and did anyone adjust the bill or give me a freebie...NO! If we were allowed food we would have eaten like kings and drank like viking kings! It was still a fat check and nothing was credited on the bill!! NINE DOLLARS! Then I realized that my buzz was less than it should be so I asked for the alcohol percentage. 5.9% was the response. I lost it. NINE DOLLAR beers have high alcohol plain and simple. So, 0.9% stronger than a Budweiser and double the price! I will never go back to this bar again and that's a shame since I have been there twice before this and I am a good tipper even to our beer server that night.",0
review_478998,drinks,"Great service!. \n\nI'm a big coffee guy and this was my first time trying Bentley's and after trying them I wondered, why did I wait so long to try this place?.

review_306990,drinks,"This BevMo gets the job done in a pinch, but my loyalties still lie with Total Wine.\n\nThe 5 cent wine sale is a steal, practically highway robbery, and I've discovered a couple of favorites during its run. They have fun tastings on Friday and Saturday afternoons, also a couple of fun discoveries made there too. Their wine selection just isn't as great as TW in my opinion, but I think their prices on hard liquor are better. They also have a nice variety of regional sodas, snacks, drinking accessories, and other food stuffs and things that add to the beverage experience.\n\nThe lines are typically too long because they never have enough cashiers; I don't know if it's bad timing or just poor staffing. I tend to come after work when everyone else is also planning to drink the day away.\n\nOverall, a decent option for a liquor and fermented grape fix.",2
review_458653,drinks,Rude Barista.\n\nIt's absolutely appalling when a cashier gives you attitude and appears annoyed that you have a large order. This is the only Starbucks where the barista at the cash register- Jessie was her name - actually gave me attitude and was annoyed that I had an $85 order of 6 drinks and breakfast items. Isn't the point of being in business to actually GET business? You'd think you'd be appreciative that businesses (such as mine) were always spending large amounts at your establishment in one order. I'll be going to the Coffee Bean next door from now on. Unbelievable.,1

review_390714,drinks,"I like Rhumbar, tasty drinks, nice waitstaff, good music and a phenomenal location...unfortunately I won't go back.  They have started charging a 3.75% CSF, a fee for no reason other than to make more money.  Our waitress told us it was called a Concession Service Fee, and that it was a way for them to make more money without raising their drink prices.  This fee is ridiculous!  The CSF wasn't even listed on our menu, it just showed up on our final bill. Charge me what the drink cost and don't tack on a fee at the end.  I'm more than willing to pay the current cost of the drink and would even pay a dollar more, their prices are competitive with other speciality bars on the strip.  In all fairness, we did a little investigating and after looking through a couple of menus we found one with the fee list, also our fee was waived when we asked to speak with the manager (he never talked to us just told the waitress to take it off the bill).  I would love to go back to Rhumbar but until they get rid of the fee I won't be back.  Lesson for anybody that does choose to go to Rhumbar, asked to speak with a manager about the CSF and they will waive it rather than have to justify their shoddy business practices to you.",0

review_356483,drinks,"Very much in the same vein as a Spoons pub, The Merlin is a pub trying to be a bit classy but ends up just being filled with lads. It is one of these new fangled gastro pubs that have sprung up everywhere in the last 5 years and as such the menu is exactly what you'd expect. There are the standard fish and chips, steak pies and grills - gammon / steaks etc and all of them are average. The food is always slightly overcooked, and you can tell they care more about avoiding potential food poisoning than actually making the food any good. The service at both tables and the bar is pretty slow, but the staff are quite friendly.\n\nThe size of the pub is both a plus and a minus. It is really roomy so you do feel you've got a bit of personal space, and it is well divided, with the pool tables at the back. The downside is that if you get a group of lads in here then they completely take over. The outside bit is great, and when I went it was really sunny so we could all sit outside and have a good few pints in the beer garden.\n\nIf you just want a bog standard pint and don't harbour any great expectations from this pub then you won't be disappointed. However if you were expecting something pretty good from the inviting look of it, then the magic doesn't live up to its namesake.",2

When we had eaten half the fries and she returned, she said \""who ordered these?\"" We had all assumed one of us did or she brought them over as an apology for the wait. Wrong! She grabbed them and scolded us for eating another table's fries. The one time we received our food within a normal time frame and had a polite server, made a world of a difference.

review_231516,drinks,"As I move to Ohio at the end of this month, I think less of trying new places and more about re-visting the ones that I have cherished over the past 12 years.  I would say the University Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf is somewhere near the top of that list.\n\nWhile I, too, like Misti Y., lament the dearth of local coffee culture built around a variety of quirky, owner/operator holes dripping with bad art, devoured sofas and coffee slung at me in a mug, I find that CBTL on Maryland always feels comfortable and homey - it even usually has a selection of, we'll say, \""local\"" art.\n\nWith an ample porch and loads of couches, the feel of this place is definitely more home-brew than corporate coffee.  The feel is very young and is a great place to study, access the internet (free) and catch-up with friends between classes.  I like the balance on both the patio and interior of light and dark.  The space is very well-lit, but there is plenty of space that is shaded.\n\nAs I've mentioned in other reviews, I'm much more of a tea drinker than a coffee drinker, and CBTL is the best place in town for iced or hot tea.  It's all kept air-tight, and all of it is loose, full-leaf tea.  They always have 4 pre-brewed selections available and they have rarely been over-brewed - simply refreshing.  I usually grab a 32oz. Lung Ching/ Dragonwell iced green tea - it runs about $2.80 for the initial cup and after that it's about $.75 for a refill!  Needless to say, I've wasted whole days here.  If you prefer something hot, I love the Earl Grey Tea Latte - creamy and soothing.  Also, try an Oatbar, a Jalapeno Cheddar Bagel or an old-fashioned donut for a snack.\n\nOne final note, any student can present ID for a 10% discount.  And, if you're a regular, they probably will just give it to you anyway.",4

review_513789,drinks,"I stopped by the Blind Pig one Thursday night after having dinner on the southside. From the reviews, I thought this place was going to be great. I was a little disappointed. Although we already had dnner, we did ordered a few appetizers to munch on- a cheese pizza and the BBQ pork nachos. The pizza was very plain. Even a little garlic powder and oregano would have made this bland pizza shine a little more. The nachos were a little disappointing as the BBQ sauce was not actually on the pork. It looked like they squirted BBQ sauce from a bottle on top of the nachos. I've had better bar food in many places. On the other hand, I felt that the drinks were good and reasonably priced. They had festivus beer on tap. I'm not sure which I love more, the beer or the holiday. When we first arrived, the bar was very quiet with only a few other people. However, it did start to fill up as the night went on when, which I'm guessing was due to \""Yinz call it.\"" All in all, not a bad place to stop on the southside for casual drinks but, I wouldn't suggest the food.",2

There's a couple that comes in and one of them plays the fiddle really well (They have other non-irish performers as well). I still say they should get somekind of Irish/Celtic jukebox that continiously plays Irish drinking songs or something. I mean, it would be a big improvement on the random mix of hip-hop/techno they do play (when their radio is actually working).

review_635374,drinks,"This is a bar trying to be more. The small plates were heavy and riffs on burgers and fries. The beer selection is what you would find at Harris Teeters and is marked up. Go to Gallery 22 if you want an amazing selection of beer, better prices, and a true tapas restaurant upstairs.",0
review_86671,drinks,I really wanted to like the Come Back because of its cool decor and classic bar feel. They also play excellent music most of the time. The one thing that ruined this place was the outrageous prices! One night a pitcher of Schlitz cost $18! Of Schlitz! You do get some free popcorn so maybe if you eat enough of that you can get your moneys worth. It is kind of a joke when you can go next store to the Essen Haus and find delicious German beer for a comparable price.,1

review_111066,drinks,"My husband calls this \""male onlys\"" for the 10 to 1 ratio of guys to girls at this bar.  I call it the \""I am way too old to be here because I stopped using a fake ID years ago\"" bar.  It is a haven for ASU students and graduates that can't give up the college life.  The five dollar big beers and classic movie clips are the two stars for this bar.",1
review_104918,drinks,"after thoroughly reading reviews of dive bars in the area to stop by on my way thru this ritzy part of town. this place definitely lived up to the ratings and opinions. I walked over from fashion square to meet an older crowd on a Saturday afternoon. not long after quietly sitting at the bar I struck up a great conversation with a couple who happened to be frequent visitors of my homeland, Maui. it was a pleasant surprise but honestly. I had a great feeling about just from reading reviews and it didn't disappoint at all. 4$ premium draft beers, who needs a slew to choose from when all you really need is the hometown brew, kilt lifter! if ever back on this side, I'll be sure to stop by and renew the sense of happiness I gleaned from this establishment.",4
review_400872,drinks,"Got a close to $4 coffee here---yeah, just regular coffee and was expecting something tasty. Not in the least bit. The coffee was weak (like Starbucks) and didn't taste like better than something I could get at 7-11. I brew better coffee at home for a fraction of a price.\n\nDefinitely a disappointment. Glad I don't live in Vegas, because if I had to buy this coffee when in need, I'd just throw myself in front of a Deuce bus.",1

review_367440,drinks,"Happy hour here did the job.  It wasn't anything amazing but our group was having trouble deciding.  We ordered rolled tacos, the sampler platter and chili cheese dip. The chili cheese dip was actually the highlight, made with green chilis and real cheese. Unfortunately their tableside guacamole and any of the seafood appetizers, like ceviche, are not included in happy hour prices.  We had six drinks total between the four of us, although my friend's fruit margarita didn't taste like it had any tequila.  For all the food and drinks we got away with only spending $40 for the four of us.",1

Last time I ordered the green tea frap and I got it back suuuuper watery. And today I got an everything bagel and they never even separated the halves so the inside could be toasted too. That is a first time for me as this is my go to item when I am on the go and stop at a Starbucks. I order these all the time and never had that. I mean, it isn't a big deal...and like I said, I do want to like this location. However the lack of effort from the people working the bar really shows through here. I hope it gets better and when it does, I will write a better review in applaud to the improvement.",1

review_364797,drinks,"We were on the Yelp Holiday Scavenger Hunt and stopped in here to have a drink. It's a cute little place, has a few outdoor tables, and good selection of liquor. The bartender seemed bothered that we stopped in to ask if they were participating in the scavenger hunt, and when we sat down to actually give her some business, she seemed more interested in the guys in the band setting up their equipment. \n\nWe ordered a couple drinks, that were ok, but the diet soda was on the flat side. When she brought back my debit card & receipt for me to sign, she never even looked at me or thanked me, she actually set MY card on the corner of the bar where she was talking to the guys in the band and walked away. I cocktailed and worked with female bartenders for over 6 yrs. You would be wise to treat your lady customers just as well as your male. We understand the business and tip well to those who deserve it.",1

review_238378,drinks,"Gotta agree with the others on here in that the service sucks! Although they did provide water with our food. Good thing cause I needed it to choke down the gross turkey, bacon and avocado wrap I ordered. The free appetizers they had out were even worse and they didn't even bother to put plates out so people were just eating with their hands. This seems to be a bar that thinks it's cool but it's not.",0
review_315246,drinks,"I like Teavana a lot, but they are like the Whole Foods of tea - pricey!!!  I found the staff here to be friendly and never felt that they were being pushy to make a sale, which is the reputation of Teavana.  They have that famous large selection of teas and will give you a whiff of the ones you are interested in.  Be careful- it is very easy to leave that store poor, what with the price of the tea tins they want you to purchase to carry the pricey tea in. \n\nMy favorite blend of theirs is the Caribbean Calypso Mate, which I am drinking now.  I also like the current Youthberry blend they are promoting, but like many of their teas it is sugary sweet.",2
review_519847,drinks,"Meh. Went here after a Suns game recently... Decent beer selection. Food was underwhelming all-around.  Even the onion rings were funky.  I will likely not be stopping in here for food in the future when there are such good options nearby.  Stop in for beers, maybe!",1

review_305327,drinks,"I thought I had made quite the discovery while mini golfing last night when I saw that whatever crab house/fish tacos place here had gone under and been converted into an irish pub. Turns out there was that yelp event here. Well regardless I knew a couple of brews here would be the perfect accompaniment to the flask of scotch I took down at Castles n' Coasters.\n\nI saw they feature 3 dollar Carlsberg's on tap and thought I was falling in love. Until they came. What is going on with the tapped beer here? I tried a Harp too, to see if it was just the Carlsberg, but both were strangely lacking their hearty flavor. I can't put my finger on it, because they weren't flat, but it was the poorest Carlsberg and Harp I ever had on tap. It also didn't help matters that the potato skins we ordered couldn't even stack up against Applebee's.\n\nAt least the had an \""Irish\"" band playing. I could tell because my ears started to bleed green and orange. Is that supposed to happen? I don't think so, especially since half of the songs they played sounded more like they were from the band in the Swayze classic \""Roadhouse\"" then befitting an Irish pub. Part of the problem just looks to be the natural acoustics of the space, but someone really needs to tell the house band that just because you can play loud enough to permanently make the entire pub crowd lose their ability to hear a violin, doesn't mean you should. They need to be able to play to the venue they have.\n\nTimmy's also features a cast of entertaining, yet depressing characters, mostly of the mid-life crisis variety. There is Jig By the Server's Station with Your Heels Off Until Your Boob Falls Out Girl. We also got to see Take of Your Jive Hat So you Can Lick the Boobs of a Cardboard Cutout Beer Model Advertisement Guy. There was a brief cameo of I'm Gonna Wear My Gears of War Hoddie AND Hat Out Wherever I Feel Like to Make it Painfully Obvious How Much I Hate Human Interaction and Want To Get Home to Some Multiplayer Action Guy. There was the Sit as Close as Possible to the Band and Shout \""Chug!Chug!Chug!\"" at Every Break Crowd. And of course who can ignore Lonely Guy Who Incessantly Claps at the Bar to Every Irish Anthem Played.\n\nI have to give the place 3 stars for effort though, and for providing an escape in the metro center area that badly needed a dependable bar other then Applebee's. Even if the potato skins suck. At least I can now get blind stupid drunk for mini-golf. UYE?",2
review_289252,drinks,"Great green drinks and superfood smoothies. My favorite item is their tiramisu - \""Coffee Cream\"" raw desert. \n\nThe gourmet flavour aspect on some of the items doesn't measure up to many of the restaurants I eaten at in LA, SF, NY or Chicago, but still, it's not half bad. Almost everything is raw and vegan, so you really can't go wrong here.\n\nGo Raw has 2 locations. This east-side one is in a mini mall next top a Massage School! Dine and unwind!",3
review_71713,drinks,"We stopped by this past weekend to check out the Peace Love & Hoppyness party.  We visited it too last year and had a great time so we were looking forward to it again.  It's a pretty reasonable beer garden.  For $30, you received a glass pint glass and $30 tokens for beer.  This year featured 50 beers to choose from but a majority of them were IPAs or heavier.  I don't mind a super heavy/dark beer once in a while but it's difficult for most people to spend an evening consuming IPAs.  Another thing was that 2 of the lighter beers were out early in the night further limiting the choices.  \n\nOverall it was a good time.  The bands were at a reasonable volume, it was outside, eclectic group of people and a good price for a Saturday night out.",3

I love margaritas usually, but this was just bad bad bad. Nothing on the menu looked that great so we just stuck with chips and salsa (average salsa). \n\nProbably won't be returning. You can get a better margarita down the street at Loco Patron or Z Tejas.",1

review_78414,drinks,"One of the worst experiences I have ever had at a brewery or winery. Sat down at a table for 3 in the bar area. 3pm on 12/26. Half-empty. After 7 minutes and not being helped, despite 3 servers + a bartender, I walked to the bar and asked the bartender if we could order from him or if someone was coming to the table. He said someone would be there in a minute. 5 minutes later, timed btw, not one person came up to us, yet checked on various tables to see if people who already had placed orders or had food were ok. The bartender knew we were waiting, saw multiple servers come up to the bar, and said nothing. Sorry, but 12 minutes to wait for sometime to come by a table for a couple of beers is absolutely ridiculous. As we walked out, we passed one of the servers who didn't even acknowledge us, even though she had seen us waiting there. This place should be ashamed of its unbelievably poor customer service. Truly appalling. Have a great beer somewhere at the strip and skip this brewery.",0

review_310031,drinks,"I will always remember my first time. It was a late Tuesday night, the lights were dim and the music was soft. I wasn't really sure where to start - but I was lucky to be with a date that was willing to show me. \n\nHonestly, I love La Bocca SO much it's a romantic affair! I have spent many of nights on the patio, enjoying glass after glass of wine with good company.\n \nBefore I go on to rant about the food, I MUST talk about the decor. There is nothing fancy about La Bocca. Yet, for some reason I always feel the need to put on a cute dress before walking (should I say running!) over. La Bocca reminds me of a little wine bar you would find tucked behind a corner in Paris. The ceilings are high, the lights are always low and the style is eclectic. I love the random artwork and the walls of windows. \n\nWhen I first found La Bocca I had very little wine knowledge. Now, three years later I know the menu like the back of my hand! The staff is always more than willing to offer tasters and educate me about what flavors I should be looking for, the body etc.\n\nThe menu is small, however everything on it is superb! In my opinion you would be doing yourself a disservice if you miss the goat cheese & pear salad. Crafted together with a spring mix, sweet candied walnuts, fresh cranberries and a balsamic vinaigrette, it is just plain amazing. I have tried many many many times to remake it and for some reason can't get it to be half as good as La Bocca.",4

Both were so poorly wrapped they fell apart picking up the first piece. We sent them back and had them remade. Both dishes tasted good, but could be outclassed in both price and taste by most supermarket sushi. The miso soup was better than most though. \n\nThe only reason for the second star is because we were comped for the Toro Scallion. Some redemption, but I shouldn't have to send anything back for such an obvious defect.",1
review_638972,drinks,"If I could give this place more than 5 stars I totally would! It's by far the best milk tea I've ever had and and the tapioca was perfect(chewy and just right amount of sweetness). \n\nYou can't sample anything other than their drink of the day because every drink here is freshly made with automatic tea shakers.  It's guaranteed that your drinks will be well shaken, and it's so entertaining just watching the machines go. \n\nI couldn't decide on whether I wanted black milk tea or green milk tea. The cashier patiently explained what's the aroma for each one and recommended me to get the oolong milk tea since I'm looking for something more TEAy. I didn't make any modifications (which I usually do at boba shops since I don't like my drinks too sweet) and let me just say it was a cup of perfection. We also tried the passion fruit tea at 70% sweetness (5 stars) as well as the pineapple green tea (4 stars). Definitely will come back again soon!",4

Their patio is beautiful and contemporary but still casual at the same time.

That's probably the best thing this place has going for it.\n\nEverything about this establishment was just average, or slightly below. The atmosphere is nice, certainly interesting. The main dining area resembles a grotto with some Wayland looking murals here and there and a starry roof that could entertain you for quite a while if you're easily amused.. as I am.\n\nService was friendly and the waiter kept my iced green tea full, but I was being checked on by two different waiters and eventually it was the busser who brought my check. Good team work?\n\nThe sushi was not very good. I had several varieties of nigiri which were all average with the exception of the albacore (mushy, grainy) and the ono which was waterlogged. Their spicy tuna roll is of the chunky variety, whereas I prefer the pate style. It was barely spicy enough and left a funk in my mouth for a while afterwards.\n\nAs excited as I was to find a sushi place near me that was open until 4am.. it didn't satisfy the craving in the least, and unfortunately I won't be back here. I'd rather make the drive across town to go to another sushi place where the last seating for AYCE is 2am.. I think you know who I speak of.",1

I had been here a couple times early on and had less than perfect experiences. I'm soooo glad I gave them another chance. Service was great too. This is our new Sunday spot.

Wings were so blah; what's the point.   Ordered Honey Hot.   Well, salt is hotter than those wings.

So not a wing place.\n\nBeer selection ho-hum.\n\nAtmosphere.  Good.  \n\nWill I go back, not unless there is a compelling reason; it's off the beaten  track for me, but friends wanted to try it.

review_357523,drinks,"The 3 times I've been in here, I've felt really uneasy. Maybe it was the big signs saying 'no phones, no cameras' - it may as well have said 'no customers' - or maybe it was the disgruntled barman 'we're not serving food' . Whichever, I didn't feel welcomed.\n\nI got the impression that it's very much a local pub, the same people come here all the time and everyone knows everyone and their son Jock. I came in looking for a drink with my auntie, luckily she was one of afore mentioned locals and so we were embraced...but I get the opinion if I went in hans-solo it would be a different story.",1

The muffin was pretty good (although certainly not fresh from the oven...but then what is these days?).\nThe coffee was also pretty good (they didn't have a dark roast option, so \""house\"" was it for me...I would prefer a little better selection from a place where the primary business is \""coffee\"").\nThey had to scramble around to get me some milk for my coffee, but scramble they did, and they came up with a carton after a couple minutes of digging in the refrigerator.\nThe prices are reasonable, and that's always a plus.

They kept the free shots coming and kept the crowd moving. The music selection was definitely strange. It's the only reason I'm rating this as 4 stars instead of 5.

We sat outside but he was so sweet to bring the drinks out to us which he really didn't have to. This review is missing a star because I wish their prices were a bit lower.

I know with a few others on the way, the westside will start getting recognized like it should.\n\nOk, first impression at pulling into the big commercial warehouse area was ok, took a minute to find the suite they were located, just keep looking left and you'll see it. Walked right in and was greeted by a really friendly bartender, and a vibe of local people wanting to try good craft beer. The setting was ok, some high top tables, barstools, and few chairs. A little cramped so if you're rolling 4 or more somebody might have to stand. Overall a moderately sized tasting room.\n\nSat down and ordered a 6 beer taster, had very interesting brews from a creme ale to some sort of chocolate stout to something like a hefeweizen.  Not bad, remember folks they're just starting out so I'm sure the have more to come as time rolls on. I'll be sure to stop in here and there to see what new brews they'll make.",2

Not to mention the rest of the delish assortment of desserts! \n\nOne thing that you should be aware of is that the seafood buffet is only available on Fridays-Sundays for only 29.99. I unfortunately was not because I was ready to get my seafood fix during lunch on a Monday until they told us the reason why the lunch buffet was only $15 was because it's only on the weekends... Boohoo! Exactly why I took  a star off along with the next star because of their limited sushi bar that was not so great, which I wouldn't expect greatness at a buffet anyway, but they should have at least given more of a selection. The lamb shoulder however, was yum! \n\n$15 on weekdays for lunch, $22 for dinner...

review_4217,drinks,"Sooo...I ended up here last Fri. night at around 10:30 after a total customer service fail at another bar downtown that shall remain unnamed (see my bad customer service list if you must know...)  My friend and I had just finished crawling the art galleries downtown, and were in the mood for some libations and grub.\n\nWe started off with some drinks.  Upon opening the drink menu, I was struck by its length and breadth.  I was initially tempted by the lavender-lemon concoction, but ultimately decided to go with a white Russian, since I'd never had one before and my lab manager had talked them up, and I enjoy my drinks sweeter as the night goes on.  It was a nice little drink--very smooth and strong, and I enjoyed the blending of the vanilla and coffee liqueur.  The best part, however, was the graham cracker crumbs on the rim!  My friend went with the painkiller, a favorite of his.  I had a sip, and it was also quite good, even though it involved coconut and I'm not usually much of a fan of coconut flavor.  Later on, he also ordered a beer (forget which kind) and a shot of yellow cake (he explained that this is a tradition because [insert backstory involving hung-over friends here]), whereas the white Russian was sufficient to quench my alcoholic thirst for the evening (I'm a lightweight when it comes to drinking).\n\nIn terms of food, we ordered the large plain macaroni and cheese.  (He doesn't eat much seafood, and I don't eat beef, which precluded all of the other options.)  Given that I'm a mac and cheese connoisseur, and that another friend recommended the mac here, I was excited to try it.  When it came out, it looked quite attractive, with interesting noodles and a sprinkling of bread crumbs on top (I'm a fan of bread crumbs on my mac).  While the flavor of the cheese was pleasant, the cheese:noodle ratio was way too low, to the point that I ended up scraping the plate to get enough of it to cover my noodles. This should never happen with a quality mac and cheese!  Even my friend, who'd had the side dish mac and cheese before, said he thought the cheese was lacking in quantity.\n\nBecause there wasn't any seating available on the patio, we were seated inside the door to the left, against the wall between the hallway and the bar.  The lighting was pretty dim, which made it a bit hard to see.  The atmosphere was definitely casual, and service was acceptable (though perhaps could have been a bit more attentive).  For the items listed above, we spent $50 + tip, which seems a bit steep.  If I were to return, I'd try to come during happy hour, since they have some nice deals on drinks and food.  3.5 stars.\n\nEDIT: I think the lack of cheesiness in the mac and cheese that I received was a fluke, based on reports from friends and the owner's comment (see below).  I'll have to come back another time to resample it--if I do, I'll update my review accordingly.",2

The sandwich was pretty standard, not bad, but not great.\n\nI'd stop back in, seems like a fun enough place.

Mixed drinks seemed to run at least $15 (I know, I know it's Vegas) and the wine was truly awful! \n\nIf you aren't a club person and are looking for a lively bar to spend an evening I think there's better (cheaper) options out there.",2

review_74925,drinks,"Church Brew Works is just cool. \n\nI love these church converts into new and different uses. Takes a beautiful structure and breathes new life. Church Brew Works is a large, open hall of eating and drinking. And drinking many fine brews. I really love CBW beer, and often buy cases at local beer distributors. \n\nSo aside from the interior awesomeness of the church, there is ample outdoor seating that is just lovely in the nicer weather. Atmosphere-check.\n\nThe food is very good, but in my opinion a little pricy. The best deals are sandwiches or their wood fired pizzas. But still a couple things bother me. Like if you want sweet potato fries with your sandwich - its a $2 up-charge. But if you look at the prices on the side orders menu the price difference of regular fries to sweet potato fries is only $1.50. It just kinda makes it seem like they are trying to get more money from you than is justified by their own menu. Another example would be that the lunch serving and dinner serving of Jambalya are something like $8 in difference but the portion size does not change or is negligible. Just doesn't seem right. \n\nAside from the pricing everything I have has there is very good. A lot of good drinking food...hearty, and very often interesting. \n\nService is really good here. One time we had to wait before someone got to our table, and we were comped some drinks.

I'm in town on a business trip and wanted to work on my laptop away from the hotel, preferably with a very good espresso drink.Maybe Seattle has spoiled me, but I was not impressed with my Americano. Coffee shouldn't need foam, sugar, or cream to taste good, but without these things my Americano was acidic and sour. I liked the atmosphere of the place, and appreciated the wifi, but did not enjoy the experience overall. Also, I wish the girl at the counter had been a little more friendly...",1

review_298978,drinks,"I hate this place. The bartender who helped us was a total assuming jerk!\n\nSpanish Steps may have a nice location on the strip, but I've been treated better.\n\nI decided to stop here with my father, so we both could have a Diet Coke, which would be followed shortly by at least one beer for myself. It was a hot Tuesday afternoon this past May, the bar was uncrowded, and there were plenty of seats.\n\nWe both sit down at the bar, order the two soft drinks, and immediately the bartender proceeds to make the drinks in to-go cups. I didn't ask for the drinks to-go, nor did you ask if I wanted them to-go. My intention was to sit there out of the sun, enjoy the drink and after a couple of sips I would order a beer to accompany the soft drink, but nope, we apparently were unwelcome if we order only soft drinks.\n\nThe bartender hands us our to-go drinks, which basically is like saying \""here you go, now leave\"" and tells us it will be $8.00.\n\nWTF? I'm floored! $4.00 for a 16 ounce soft drink is outrageous!\n\nWould I be complaining if we had been served correctly, been given refills on the soft drink and felt welcomed so I would've gotten my beer- absolutely not.\n\nSo we paid the tab, didn't tip the bartender a cent since clearly his level of service was on par with a fast food restaurant and walked on to another bar where I was treated right. Just a side note, but at the next bar I got another Diet Coke, but also drank three beers and on top of the 20% tip I gave on that bill I also handed the bartender the tip the idiot at Spanish Steps should've received for the $8.00 tab!\n\nSo basically, Spanish Steps you can shove it!",1

Great way to taste some brews before you stop by the specialty shop and spend $10-20 on a bottle.  Food is very very good - but make no mistake, this is an alehouse, not a restaurant, so the menu is small.  Also, the menu is for foodsies, so if you're more of a burger and fries kind of person, eat before you come.  If you love creative dishes with ingredients like prosciutto or chorizo, you'll like eating here.  Will be back many times, I'm sure.",3
review_78395,drinks,"Drove into town just becaus of the Yelp! reviews we read while passing thru Pennsylvania.  It was about an hour an a half out of our way, but I'd say it was worth it.\nMy wife and I had the fish n'chips while the kids tried the pub burgers. We all thought the food was above average.   The portion sizes were large and tasty, and we all left feeling quite satisfied.\nThe atmosphere was nice, considering the outside of the buidling - they've got a clean open restaurant that we really felt comfortable in.   The staff was all pretty hospitable, too.\nThe only complaint is that when I asked about drinks, the waiter had to explain that every beer on the bottom half of the menu was out.    I understand a craft brewery having times when a particular brew will sell out or be replaced by a seasonal, but HALF THE MENU?   Let's be honest - I'm here for the beer.  I don't care a bit about your food, folks.  \nEven still, I found beer to drink, and it was a tasty Pils.  The lack of selection is all that kept these folks from getting my 5 star review.",3

review_370862,drinks,"I am a huge fan of DD coffee and donuts. Have been since I was a kid (at least the donut part). For the first time, I tried a different food option other than the donuts, and opted for the Egg White Turkey Sausage Flatbread, but had to have the mainstay of coffee.\n\nThis flatbread thing was a congealed conglomeration of egg whites, a lot of green specs (guessing that was spinach) and a sparse spattering of little brown cubes (the turkey sausage part of it), all sitting in between over-sized slices of flat stuff. While this may sound appetizing or unappetizing to all of you, it was neither. The freaking thing was tasteless!!! The fact that I had to suck down coffee to moisten this dryness I had in my mouth and gullet was the only thing that gave me an indication that I actually had eaten something.\n\nAs for service at this location, it was OK. I used the drive-thru, which is uncommon for me, and I had to wait for close to 5 minutes before I was asked about my order. The person did apologize for the wait, but the fact that I waited for that long before someone even acknowledge that I was there was a bit irksome.\n\nBased on what I had and the service that I received, I give this joint one star. If it weren't for the usually great, smooth coffee, I would've tried to give a negative star rating in order to warn others of the perils of ordering something outside of the wheelhouse of DD (which are donuts and coffee).",0

review_414721,drinks,"i'm not one to wright reviews about restaurants but i just couldn't ignore the awful time we had this past weekend. i love this bar. i really do. the selection of beer is amazing and the food is even better. but the service is beyond lacking and that's why i only give it 2 stars. keep in mind that if this had happened to me only once at this bar, i wouldn't even write this review and just chalk it up to a bad night. But  its happened just about every time we go there and i'm sad to say this past weekend will probably be the last time we go there.\n\nwe came in with a group of 5 people. we sat down and ordered some beer and food. i wouldn't have called it a busy night by any means. service was good for about 30 minutes. then it slowed. while we waited for her to come back, we were able to make eye contact with her, to which she ignored and took the long way around the bar into the kitchen to put in other orders. she then proceeded to hide in the bar area so we couldn't see her. her avoidance tactics were on point.\n\nafter sitting without service for a good 40 minutes we finally got fed up and were somehow able to get her attention. when we asked her to split the tab for she she said she wouldn't and copped a bit of an attitude. she dropped the tab at the table and stormed off. \n\nthis happens just about every time we go to this bar. unfortunately I've never been served by any other server at this bar, and maybe that's the issue. Maybe she's just not fond of her job. at any rate if a larger group was to come into my restaurant, i would want to see that they were well taken care of, at least for the sake of a few good tips. \n\nneedless to say we went down the street to Tenaya Creek where one bartender kept everyone happy all night. \n\nif you're going to go to Aces and Ales, maybe just place a ToGo order for the food and buy a growler of what ever beer you want, (if they still offer that option) and go home.",1

First timers, make sure to try Four Peak's famous Kilt Lifter beer. I'm personally a huge fan of Sunbru and Peach Ale. In terms of food, the chicken strips are delicious. The four peaks menu also includes beer recommendations based on your order. Parking is a little bit challenging, but there is always space if you're willing to walk a little bit. The four peaks parking lot is small, but you can park in the alley in the back of the brewery or along 8th street. Definitely a place I'd recommend visiting if you're visiting Tempe and looking for some good brews.",4

They at least have all the basic favorites and some limited/seasonal brews, but havent spotted anything of particular rarity. Good single/big bottle selections too. \n\nService- most people indifferent but theres a few people who chime in and get excited about our purchases and talk craft beer.

review_86684,drinks,"Great Beer Selection, Great Wings, Mostly Bad Service, Horrible Management.\n\nLet me preface this by saying that I've been a regular of the Come Back In for more than a decade, the earlier years out of choice, more recently because ...  well, I think it's really just that my friends like the free peanuts and popcorn and I get outvoted if I suggest going elsewhere too often.\n\nPROS:\n\n- The afore-mentioned free popcorn (good and salty - serve yourself as you come in next to the bar) and free peanuts in the shell (ask for them at the bar).\n\n- They have an excellent beer selection, roughly two dozen tap beers split evenly between Wisconsin microbrews, other American microbrews, and imports, plus a big case filled with a good variety of imports and in-state and other American microbrews in the bottle.  Like something German next door at the Essen Haus?  Ask for it and they'll pop through the adjoining door and get you a mug of it (same ownership).\n\n- Their buffalo wings are very good, as good as any in town from BW3, Quaker Steak & Lube, or anywhere else, plus are bigger and meatier (I usually ask for them to cook them extra crispy to make sure they're fully done) and only cost 50 cents each.\n\n- They have a beer club.  Every sixth tap beer you order is free, fill out the card (around 40-50 beers) and get a free meal.\n\n- Some of their servers and a few of their bartenders are very pleasant and are really nice and give good service.  Don't expect to see them again next time you pop in a month later, though (see below)\n\n-They have some interesting stuff as decorations (huge Native American arrowhead collection, lots of vintage UW sports memorabilia, lots of vintage beer cans, signs, tap handles, etc..)\n\nCONS:\n\n- The regular weekday bartender, the bespeckled Jen, the only front-of-the-house employee to survive here long-term, is, to be blunt, mediocre-to-crappy in every way.  She might look like a kindly librarian, but she's stingy and gives the bare minimum of service.  She has poured hundreds of beers for me over the years, and EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM has been a short pour.  Think that a bartender should offer something on-the-house to a regular customer (up until then a good tipper, too) on his birthday?  That's reasonable, isn't it?  Well, not to Jen.  Think a bartender should tell long-standing regulars about the bar's beer club so they can avail themselves of free beers?  Jen sure didn't - she kept mum about it for years and it was only when a short-lived new bartender who asked us for our beer club numbers and explained about the program that we learned of it.  Jen, if you read this review, it's time to learn that a gratuity-based service provider who doesn't provide good service doesn't deserve a good tip - that's why you're probably making less money now than you did 5 or 10 years ago.\n\n- The manager, a middle-aged guy with 1960's glasses and a mean stare is, to be blunt, one of the least friendly, most unpleasant, most overbearing, least-customer service-oriented,  etc... (I could go on with negatives to exhaust the review word count without coming close to finishing) .  When I discovered that the lovely Jen had failed to tell us about the beer club and refused to do something about it, I talked to the manager, explained that as I was sure he recognized, my friends and I were regulars for years, we had lost out on free beers for years.  He mumbled a curt \""Sorry\"" and walked away.  I was astonished.  I had to chase him down and told him that we had essentially been cheated out of many free beers and that as regulars of his bar for a decade, he ought to do something about it for us.  He grumbled and bitterly said \""OK, I'll give you a free round.\""   That was it.  One free beer each.  Additionally, the manager hovers and over-supervises, making for a unpleasant atmosphere, plus he's a royal ass to his employees, which is why this bar has probably the highest turnover rate of any business in town.  Given that most bartenders, for the few weeks that they can stand working here, won't fill a beer mug all the way,  I suspect that the manager orders them to pour short.\n\n- The food, other than the wings, is so-so, very typical bar food, not as good as the late night menus from Chilis, Applebees, etc...  Breakfast is supposed to be good, but haven't had it.\n\nAs soon as the new Ale Asylum brewpub opens near the airport, I think I need to convince our gang to frequent there or else to the Malt House for beer or Alchemy for beer and food when service has been too bad at the Come Back In.  As I write this, I feel kind of dumb for having given this bar so much of my business over the years.  In summary, if you like good beer and good Buffalo wings,  plus can tolerate mediocre-at-best service, you might like this joint.  Otherwise, it's entirely skippable.",1

I love me some sashimi and Viva Las Vegas rolls, I have yet to try more of the other RA creations but the prices for them are a little ridiculous to me to be completely honest.  I have gone to this location more than twice but not more than a handful of times. I think this past Saturday was another reminder of why I hate going to RA. Regardless of how busy it may be. I would have given the girl a break but it wasn't THAT busy!!  The things I normally ask for with my sushi I did not bother asking because our waitress was too busy gossiping with the hostess' and flirting with the guys sitting a table over.  I haven't had this bad of service in a long time, It makes you really appreciate those that are good at what they do. I cannot expect too much its the Scottsdale location i kind of saw it coming but at the same time the fact that I didn't really want to ask the waitress for the essential things I usually ask for that isn't hard to handle at all is pretty bad. Because I knew in the back of my head that the broad would take a million years to come back because she had to tell her life story to every one on the way.  \n\nI am not one to bash a restaurant or business on the regular but it just seems like every where besides ATL wings in chandler I have been not only been getting the worst service ever out with friends but not so great of food either.

When most empty bars would probably embrace 25 people walking in the door wanting to order drinks, the Stoudemire's staff seemed overwhelmed and annoyed.  The restaurant is nice and clean, and the drinks were good yet overpriced.  I would defnitely not reccomend it for large groups.  For people looking for a good sports bar downtown head to Majerles because the patrons there seemed to be enjoying themselves and the staff seemed to enjoy having business.",1

We still stayed and had a beer, heck we were there so why not.  \n\nThe Beer was good.  They have a good selection and it was priced normally.  I think we paid $3 for a beer.

Hell I cant get a Belgium Delerium Tremens for $8 at most places, why is it $16 here. It's almost cheaper to play $20 at a 25\u00a2 Video Poker machine and get two comp beers.",1
review_502061,drinks,"Seventh Street Market has filled in quite a bit since I wrote my Not Just Coffee review (ROTD 5/9/2012). With the farmer's market, the wine shop, Pure Pizza, a bakery and more, there isn't much floor space left to be had. NJC, on the other hand, hasn't changed a bit.\n\nAND THAT'S NOT A BAD THING! They make excellent coffee and I have come around to the richness of what they sling here.\n\nMuch better of a hangout joint now with the additional food options, but there is now wifi and power outlets and you can get your parking pass stamped for free/discounted parking.\n\nI had their caramel steamer (no caffeine, hoorah!) and an iced coffee to go. The steamer was light and sweet and perfectly caramelized. Did you know they make their own caramel here? It was perfect. The iced coffee was deeply flavored and needed no cream or sugar, which for me is a surprise as I usually add both.\n\nYum!",4
review_445414,drinks,"A good choice for happy hour on the Strip (half off drafts, $1 wings, $2 oysters, $3 sliders from 3-6pm and 10-midnight).\n\nThe whole menu looked pretty good, but since we had late dinner plans I limited myself to only things on the happy hour menu. The sliders and oysters were the most impressive: the oysters were fresh and served with several sauces and the sliders tasted much better than your average run of the mill hamburger. The wings were pretty disappointing, very little meat and a buffalo sauce that could have easily come out of a jar. Especially at $1 each, you can definitely do much better for wings elsewhere so it's probably a good idea to avoid those altogether.\n\nThe beer selection is HUGE but slightly pricey without the happy hour discount ($10-14). Make sure to pick something that you haven't tried before. Ask your waiter for help if you need it.\n\nIf you're into chugging, make sure to go to the bar for the 7 second challenge. If you can chug a beer in under 7 seconds, they'll ring a bell for all to hear and your beer is on the house.",3
review_577970,drinks,"Come for Happy Hour at the bar area and leave. \n\nMy friends and I decided to check out The View last night for happy hour. Unfortunately they do not serve any food at their happy hour. Draft wines for $2 though, are a steal. However the wines are not of the greatest quality. They also serve Stella Artois (on draft) for $3. AS much as I liked the prices, the service was mediocre. My friends and I waited to pay our bills for a good 10 minutes while the one bar server made cheese boards. She literally was away from all of her bar patrons for a good 5-7 minutes. In bar time - that is a really long time not to be able to talk to the people at your bar and get them more drinks. \n\nWe then were seated in the dining area, which is really nice and open with awesome chairs that made me feel like I could sit there for hours. We also got a pretty awesome spot in front of a window in front of Tivoli's fountain. \n\nI found their wine menu to be somewhat of a disappointment. Yes, they offer a decent variety, but when I think \""Wine Bar\"" I was expecting a booklet, not a page. Also, wines from France were sorely missing. There was only two, one of which you could only order per bottle. California and Washington varietals are center stage here. I ordered the \""dryer\"" Riesling for $13, which I thought was decent enough, although I've had better. \n\nFood - I wanted the 5 Cheese Soup, but was informed they were out, in a hurry, and not really thinking, I ordered the Tomato Soup instead. What I was served was a puddle of tomato soup in a huge bowl. I will honest-to-God say the bowl had 6 spoonfuls of soup in it. At $6 a pop for a sip of soup I found it to be a huge let-down. Be conscious the style here is \""tapas\"", small plates for sharing, but really, was I going to share my 6-spoonfuls of soup? Hell no I wanted a bowl of soup!\n\nI also had the \""Green Eggs and Ham\"" Carbonara, which was delicious. The sauces were perfect, the addition of the egg was perfect. The crispy pork belly was not crispy. It was a lump of pork, flaccid and not up to par. I wish I had gotten an entire plate, again, I was severely disappointed at the size of my pasta, especially considering I was STILL hungry after I had finished it. I was wishing I had gone to Brio across the street and paid the same exact amount of money and gotten a huge-ass plate of spaghetti.\n\nI like the idea, but I do not like the execution of The View. I will always compare tapas (no matter what they are) to Firefly, and Firefly beats this place out hands down a million times over. Also, Nosh & Swig, a place that also does \""American\"" tapas is better than The View with cheaper prices and better quality/quantity of food presentation. \n\nService in the dining area was okay, but somewhat awkward. We were given a horrible \""appetizer\"" (for free...) that consisted of cold peanuts, a thin slice of radish, a weird dried-out carrot, and what I think was two celery sticks. Mind you, there were three girls sitting at my table, whatever would we want with this weird concoction of \""food\""? \n\nService - 3/5\nFood - 2.5/5\nAmbiance - 4/5\n\nI will not make a return trip. There are places with better wine and better food that will not leave me yearning for an Inn N Out burger after my meal.",1

I'm partial to the pilsner and the saison \u00e9t\u00e9 myself, but drinking companions have commented on the quality of the blanche and the cream ale as well.

I've also been here on a Saturday night and watched an older man and woman having some sort of sexual encounter while leaning against the bar behind us (have pics to prove it).  When they finished, he left and she took a nap on the bar!!\n\nTried to stop in last week with out of town guests for a drink but as we walked in the doors, 4 security guys came right up to us and questioned whether we were there for a movie or the lounge.  I said the lounge and was then told they have a business casual dress code.  He said this while staring directly at my Dutch friend in khaki shorts, polo shirt and birkenstocks.  No problem we said and left.  We hung around for Alive after 5 and when we walked by Mez I could see it was empty in there, and many employees were just standing around staring through the glass at what was going on outside.\n\nI understand a dress code where baggy pants, sneakers, hats and that kind of gear isn't allowed.  But since when in Charlotte was preppy not acceptable?  I mean a woman can get pleasured and fall asleep on the bar but my friend can't wear sandals??  Seems a bit ridiculous to me!!",0

So what's changed?*\n\nThe spirit selection has grown to provide a great range of whisky, rum or gin, some of which are rarely seen premium products. The new(ish) Three Hop and Birra Moretti have replaced the Heineken as a premium draft lagers and there is now a 4th guest ale tap, so even more choice for the beer/lager enthusiast. Finally Symonds has replaced Strongbow, an improvement on the draft cider front. \n\nOn the food front, after taking part in the Tollcross chilli cook-off (recommended outing to all those who Yelp in Edinburgh) the chilli is really good. Chips cooked in beef dripping - they taste great! There have been one or two other menu tweaks, though the classics are all still in-place and tasty.\n\nThe prices are still reasonable and the bar itself is still well staffed and pleasant. So all in all Lock 25 is possibly verging on a great pub to have a drink or something to eat.\n\n*If I missed any changes put it down to sampling some of those spirits and the passing of time...",3

We enjoy the coffee, the snacks they offer are always delicious, and the space is great.\n\nMy only complaint is the service, and it's only one barista in particular.  We get great service from everyone else.  Much like one of the reviewers below, we have had this barista just stare at us when come up to the counter with a strange look on her face, and she says nothing.  I decided to just start ordering when the strange look turned into a nasty looking smirk.  I've asked her about some of the food on previous visits, if she had eaten it, and she made another strange face and said, \""Uh, no.\""  This barista really creates a terrible vibe for our visits, and seems very unfriendly and rude.  \n\nWe LOVE the place, for every other reason, but next work-session, we are going to try somewhere else.

There are some people who think a really cool process means they make really good coffee, but I've tasted coffee from all over North America and this place has a great process, but the coffee is NOT what it is said to be.\n\nI wasn't alone in the tasting of this review, but only wanted to comment on MY input. However, I will add that the three actual coffee drinkers were all sitting sipping afraid to tell me that the great place I took them to wasn't good at all. Each one of them happy when I finally admitted that I wasn't too keen on this coffee. And one by one they dumped their coffee out.\n\nNow I'm not saying that everyone will find the coffee here undrinkable - but for these four New Yorkers - we've been spoiled by really good coffee without all the fuss! Therefore, I will be removing a star!\n\nAfter a bit more researching - it appears that this owner likes to bash anyone who doesn't think the output of his input is worth having. Though there may be many who enjoy this place - I stand firm on my 1 star review!",0
review_610961,drinks,"I was so excited to finally see some good beer on tap here in Vegas! The pizza is delicious, but it's expensive. You get a 16 inch pizza and prices for their signature pies range upwards to $30. The create your own pizza starts at $22 for a cheese pizza, and each topping is $2, $3, or $4, depending on the topping. We got a half pepperoni and mushroom and half eggplant, onion, and mushroom pizza. As I said, it was tasty. It was a thin crust that was slightly crunchy. \n\nUnfortunately, even though we got our toppings on half the pizza, with the exception of the mushrooms, they charged us the full price for each topping (e.g., they still charged us the full $2 for the eggplant, even though it was only on half the pizza). Beers were up to $10 for a pint and could be up to $30 for a pitcher.\n\nI get that the target crowd at Aria might not think the prices were as high as I thought they were. Ultimately, the food is great, but you probably could find better deals elsewhere.",3
review_448795,drinks,"In the pantheon of Edin-burgher (see what I did there?) joints, Treacle stands somewhere mid-table for me. \n\nIt was a pre-theatre bite and my first experience eating at the bar. The burgers had been recommended on several occasions by friends so I went for it. In hindsight, I saw LOADS more on the menu that interested me over the burger but went for it anyway. Get it out the system so to speak. And now I'm hankering for another go at that menu to see what I missed out on. As burgers go, I can immediately think of at least 4 bars I'd sooner go to to get my burger on.\n\nIn its old incarnation as Baroque, Treacle was a previous after work local. They (used to) do some decent Friday happy hour deals, and their cocktails are awesome (try the Margherita... ridiculous!), but with happy hours being abolished in our fair capital, that asset has unfortunately flown from Treacle's portfolio.\n\nLocated on Broughton Street, not too far from the likes of 12 Picardy Place, GHQ, the Basement, etc. it's a no-brainer that Treacle falls into the trendy and attractive area of the scale, but thankfully it's well enough away from George Street so as not to become completely rife with posers and ponces comparing their bright-whites like a bunch of girls dancing round a handbag (don't worry Amicus Apple... you're review is coming...!).\n\nWhen it was Baroque and an after work regularity, I was a massive fan. As Treacle, I'm not quite convinced as yet. It's an attractive bar with attractive staff, no qualms or complaints there. They do impressive cocktails and an interesting menu, both plusses. Is the music funky? Yes, but also too loud for this kind of venue. Are the drinks a little pricey? Yes, considering the likes of Lloyds and Walkabout (if you're not too fussy) are considerably cheaper and a stones throw away.\n\nSo I'm on the fence. I don't throw out 3 star reviews very often largely because there's never usually enough to say about them... hence the 3 stars (vicious cycle much?!). But I suppose for a bar with a menu that includes Crispy Coconut Chicken or Griddled Pear Salad or Bounty Bar, Mascarpone & Lime Cheesecake, I WANT to say more about them.\n\nAnd so for now, I hope I can ramp up that rating a star or two after I've had another crack at that menu.\n\nSee you soon, Treacle. Round 2.... ding ding!",2

New Amsterdam has a huuuge projection screen on which they show sports. In Pittsburgh, you'd think it'd be crowded to the hilt on game day - not!

review_354671,drinks,"I'm an Oxford girl myself, and so always had a slight, lingering suspicion of anything with the word Cambridge in the title; in the case of the Cambridge bar, this unease was exacerbated by the fact that the Oxford Bar is just down the road.\n\nHowever, I'm sure I went in with an open mind, determined to enjoy myself.  Which I did, mostly. It's a lively and buzzy place that attracts a young-ish crowd, noisy, but still possible to have a conversation there.\nI've just got a couple of gripes about this place; firstly, I ordered a veggie burger that cost about six pounds, was burnt, and didn't even come with chips! Which was disappointing.  \n\nSecondly, and this may seem petty but I have strong feelings about these things, as the evening drew to a close, my friends and I decided to have just another half pint each before going home, so I went to the bar clutching what I thought was a more than sufficient amount of money.  I had, of course, calculated how much it would cost by halving the price of a normal pint, because that's the way it works in every other pub.  That makes sense, because it's the same beer but you're only having half as much of it, so it should cost half the amount, right? Well, not in the Cambridge, where a half is \u00a32.90, as much as a whole pint costs in most other establishments.  I was outraged more on principle than about the actual money.\n\nSo, I shall not be frequenting this place, and have had my irrational prejudice confirmed: places named Cambridge are not to be trusted.",1

review_398436,drinks,"For me, eating is all about texture and flavors and frozen yogurt is one of my favorite summertime treats for its cool creaminess. mmmm. I stopped in to Yogurtland two weeks ago and at 3 in the afternoon it was packed with children (yuck, minus 1 for you yogurtland). I persevered, making my way to the awkwardly arranged yogurt dispensers. Why are there glass columns in the middle of the shop? It makes getting in and out unnecessarily difficult. \n\nAnyway, I sampled a few besides deciding on Taro frozen yogurt. Taro?! YUMMY! Pistachio, coconut and even the \""tart\"" lemon lime one were very good. I'm also a big vanilla fan but I didn't get to try that as 2 idiot children were running around eating their body weight in free samples of chocolate and vanilla, and the machine ran out and for about 15 minutes the employees didn't know what to do about it. \n\nSo the point is, thank god kids are back in school, you can probably go to Yogurtland with much less to-do AND the yogurt is delicious, has the perfect consistency, creative flavors and lots of toppings for the toppings-inclined. There are no 'small' cups as the payment is by weight but they can't pressure me into overloading my cup, haha! The world's cheapest girl got away from Yogurtland having spent only 2.12 on two orders!",3
review_486893,drinks,"Fantastic Wine & Chocolates!\n\nThis is one of the best wine and chocolate stores in the Carolinas. They have top-shelf wines and fabulous wine tastings, add to it they do a fantastic job creating gift baskets, along with multiple gift baskets for companies.  I would suggest them for every company in the Carolinas, that is how fantastic they are.  \n\nIn my opinion, Number 1 wine store in Charlotte!!!",4

review_188505,drinks,"I don't know if there's anything I can say about this place that doesn't already come across in the pictures.  The pastries are fabulous.  They also have sandwiches that are great for taking back out to the pool or just eating right there. \n\nThe drink prices are a little higher than you'd expect - the Aria is one of the only casinos on the strip that doesn't have a Starbucks, so your run of the mill chai latte will run you around $6 bucks as opposed to $4 at Starbucks.  But you really do get what you pay for - I wasn't disappointed.",3

You should be, as it was a tough go the 1st 100 yards or so, and it was already in the mid 90's. After a mile or 2 I doubled back to Mandalay Bay in search of a Bloody Mary. Whaaaat? Its Vegas damn it. Walked around the casino to discover the bars were not yet open at nearly 9am. Hey! I thought this was Vegas not Des Moines.\n\nI decided to take the air conditioned route through the mall thing that stretches through a couple of hotels and drops one directly across from \""The Trop.\"" Panic started to creep in as I passed a few more shuttered restaurants. Wait, someone up ahead opening their doors for business. Is it a clothing store or..?? OMG, its an Irish Pub. I thought the heat was affecting me and I was dreaming a desperate dream.\n\nSure enough, 9am sharp and these Angels of Mercy were beckoning me towards the flashy bar. Some slick looking kat with (presumably) an Irish accent welcomed me like a long lost mate. Feeling better already.\n\nMy new mate Tom made me a killer Stoli Mary, and soon some fellow dehydrated patrons showed up and it turned into your typical neighborhood Irish bar kinda place. Yeah, right here in Fauxville Vegas. Especially unexpected in this mall tunnel thingy. \n\nMy intention was a one n done, but my other new mates seated next to me ordered some delicious looking breakfasts, and I was soon requesting that menu that I previously returned to Tom. He recommended the Irish Eggs Benedict, which listed Rashers as an ingredient, and he informed it was the Irish version of Canadian bacon. I just looked it up and found this definition: \""Rashers (n): pieces of bacon; female genitalia.\""  Ahem, think I will move on without further comment. \n\nI also looked up Ri-Ra (n): Irish expression for fun and excitement.\n\nGreat breakfast, great service, great vibe.

This place has a trendy yet accessible vibe, and I look forward to going back again soon for breakfast/brunch!",3
review_354464,drinks,"This is a Wetherspoons pub so you probably know what to expect price wise and food wise. But what makes its special is that it is an old bank, with a real bank vault. Its a stunning building on the inside if you take a moment to admire the original features. \n\nHowever as its so huge, it really lacks atmosphere. It feels like it isn't making the best of what could be a fantastic bar. As its cheap and on George Street, no matter what night you go its going to be extremely busy. If there is a big football match on, then its going to be even busier. It gets very crowded and there isn't enough seats so you'll probably have to stand. And you will probably queue at the bar for a long time too. \n\nIts not great, but its worth having a peek to look at the impressive building.",2

Not just anyone can turn a vacant fast food restaurant in a strip mall parking lot into a top notch coffee shop.  But the awesome doesn't end there.  By day, they are a coffee shop that serves delicious food, has a full bar and some of the coolest, most fun baristas in the city.  By night, 32 Shea is the perfect place to grab a glass of wine and some amazing bruschetta, or the dinner of the day with an delicious craft beer or even a lavosh pizza and a mint lemon drop martini (holy yumminess). \n\nThe homemade green salsa and bloody mary mix are not to be missed!\n\n**Friend 32 Shea on Facebook or follow them on Twitter to make sure you never miss out on the awesome daily deals they offer.  Another bonus is that you will always know what the dinner of the day is!",3
review_323761,drinks,"We stopped by Amelie's after dinner and I was quite impressed.  The place was huge with plenty of seating.  I really like the way they have the place decorated with bright colors and lots of crazy art on the walls.  They had a wide variety of pastries to choose from which automatically makes them worthy of 4 stars in my book.  I tried a chocolate mousse cup and it was delightful!  It was so sweet I thought I'd have to stop after only 2 bites, but before I knew it the whole thing was gone.  I just couldn't stop myself!  The only drawback to this place was it was incredibly busy when we stopped by at 8:30pm on a weekday.  This is the type of place that I'd normally like to get a pastry and coffee and have a seat to relax for a bit.  With all the commotion I didn't think we'd be able to enjoy ourselves so we got our treats to go.",3

When I used work in old town I would make my trek down Scottsdale road on foot even on those hot summer days when cars pass you by just to bring excruciating gusts of hot desert air upon your back it was well worth it for their  iced lattes. \n\nNow I have discovered Affagoto, a large scoop of your choice gelato and fresh brewed espresso poured on top to create a delicious heart pounding  rush of caffeine and sugar. It feels like how one would feel when they fall in love for the first time, but this comes at only a $5 price and you can feel it all over again. \n\nThe staff is great, courteous and very informative in making suggestions. \n\nGelato Spot Thank you!",4

I've gotten the crab buckets a few times, I didnt get the oysters b/c the waitress couldnt tell me where they were from, I'm from Florida so I kinda take seafood seriously...

We walked in hoping to sit outside and noticed there were two empty tables in their patio area. We were told it would probably be a 15 minute wait, no problem, so we sat at the bar. \n\nThe bar was steady but not packed - there were even some empty stools. There were two bartenders working and we noticed there were quite a few interesting microbrews on tap we wanted to try. However, we sat at the bar for almost 15 minutes and neither bartender ever even came and talked to us.

As Charlie Sheen would say \""Winning!!!!\""\n\nI had a groupon so Laura A. and I went to try out this amazing place.  The groupon got us each two scoops so we went with 4 different so we could sample the most possible.  I got the Apple Pie / Spiced Rum and Black Raspberry / Chambord Liqueur.  Both were awesome I actually enjoyed the Chambord the most but I was in ice cream heaven.  \n\nLaura got the Mimosa with Champagne and the Margarita / Tequila.  I really enjoyed both of her's the margarita was a strawberry one which is my fav.  The Mimosa was very refreshing and I could imagine that being a great hangover remedy at about 11am on a Saturday =) just sayin.  \n\nI have found a new place to cure my sweet cravings and can't wait to try more flavors as the website has many more I didn't see in store so I assume they are on rotation which is great.  \n\nI hope that eventually I can find a pinapple upside down cake with rum flavor",4

Lovely decor, and we managed to snag a couple of comfy chairs (although it was tight on a Sunday afternoon!), but the ale selection was not out of the ordinary, and the whole experience wasn't anything special. They do make lovely chips though.\n\nI would like to go back to eat, and I'll probably stop in again the next time I'm walking to or from Craigmillar Castle.

review_472942,drinks,"I like the passion that the head brewer has and that he is trying to make beers that you would see from a home brewer, but it just doesn't come across that well in the finished product. They have a stage and live music, they have a nice staff, and there is usually a food truck outside. So all in all not a bad place to hang out, unfortunately the beers are just okay. The beer with honey is available in different restuarants for 1 dollar a pint, if that doesn't tell you about it nothing will. The only high note available was what they called an accident, it was the sour porter which was strong, bitter, and left a cherry after taste. Can be fun I'm sure but for beer I'm going elsewhere.",2
review_558264,drinks,"This is a cute, little, space in RoRo. The staff were very friendly and eager to talk about their menu. I ordered a green juice, and it was delicious! A good balance of flavors, and the cayenne pepper was present, but not overpowering the drink. Upon my curiosity being piqued, I bought a vegan snickerdoodle (and I'm NOT a vegan girl), and that cookie was surprisingly like a traditional snickerdoodle! I would have been fooled had I not known! My only reservation in awarding three, and not more, stars is in the pace of the service. I wanted my juice drink to go, and although there was only one other table occupied in the restaurant, I waited nearly a full 20 minutes for my juice to be made and me to pay. So, moral of the story, as long as you don't expect to be anywhere in a hurry, go here. You'll likely enjoy the meal. Me... I liked what I got, but I was late for my appointment because of the wait.",2

I was still hoping it was a little country so I put on my big boy pants (wranglers) a polo shirt and my Dan Post lace ups to try and be very casual. We were overdressed.

You must check out the website. http://dierkswhiskeyrow.com     It is more like a sports bar than a country bar, though they do have live scheduled shows. \nThe food other people in our party ordered was good.  It all looked great. I did not eat, this visit. \nI noticed several people giving 5 star reviews, I have a different standard.  The space is beautiful a typical trendy place for Scottsdale.  For God sake, do not wait in line to get in people. There are 50 bars within a ten block radius.",1
review_109482,drinks,"Great beer. Great food. Great service. I ordered a delicious lamb burger which included  spinach, tomato, red onion, crumbled feta, and tzaziki sauce in between parmesan crusted toasted foccacia bread. This place can be family friend or a great place to unwind after work. I highly recommend happy hour! $3.75 pints and  $13 pitchers.",4
review_478672,drinks,"LOVE them!! I have been with them forever! Even though I have moved to the other side, I still come back here for their service and excellent drinks. I love the Granites the most. My girls all make me feel happy and have been there for me with smiles on my worst days. They know Dee is there and I wish I could be there more, but I live a little more out of the way. I try to get there when I'm in the area and I just have to let them know DEE love them and they make the BEST coffee in town, it's so worth me driving a half hour just for the drinks and to see them!",4
review_281092,drinks,"Come here for Happy Hour! You have to go the website for your location, but this one has it from 5 to 7, I believe. They have appetizers at the from from $1 to $5 and there are some pretty good items. I tried the fish tacos (which were not too good to me - very fishy tasting), the cheeseburger and fries (a big, quality burger seasoned well with fries for $2), the mussels (good), and more that I cannot remember. \n\nThere is a pretty good crowd at the bar. The bartenders are ok. They are so busy that I guess they don't have time to be friendly, but they are nice.\n\nI will be back whenever I'm in town!",3
review_191834,drinks,Never been to a better coffee shop! The staff here are even better than the coffee!! I also enjoyed one of their many vegan options & had the Zucchini muffin. ..yummm. Come enjoy this place!,4
review_467251,drinks,"Mittlerweile waren wir zweimal im Caf\u00e9 Bleu. Geh\u00f6rt auch zur Gruppe Kippe/Emaille.\nWar ich sowohl in der Kippe als auch im Emaille immer zufrieden, hatte ich im Caf\u00e9 Bleu zweimal \""\u00c4rger\"".\n\n\n Das Essen und die Getr\u00e4nke dazu lassen gerade im Sommer lange auf sich warten.\nDas sehe ich noch ein. \u00c4rgerlich wurde es dann allerdings nach dem Essen.\nIch bestellte mir bei beiden Besuchen danach noch ein weiteres Getr\u00e4nk. Und wartete bei beiden Malen eine halbe Stunde, bis ich nochmal nachfragte. Bei beiden Malen wurde diese Bestellung einfach schlichtweg nicht ausgef\u00fchrt.\nSomit also nochmal bestellt und warten m\u00fcssen. Bei der zweiten Bestellung kam es dann allerdings auch.\nDennoch sehr \u00e4rgerlich, meiner Meinung nach.\n\n\n Zum Drau\u00dfensitzen ist es zwar echt sch\u00f6n, aber nachdem zweimal das gleiche passiert ist, bevorzuge ich mittlerweile das Emaille.",1
review_467464,drinks,"I had fond memoried of this Wetherspoons chain as i went on my 1st date with my partner here, however since returning on a few occasions through a few various friend invites, i found it to be very disspointing. The service at the bar was terrible, I had to wait for what felt like ages and saw other being serviced before myself, (i think the staff must work a their own certain section of the bar). I ordered a Rioja (red wine) of which the girl who served didnt seem to know what that was and it was on whole very impersonal. I have had food i here previously and is was okay, nothing special. Agb is cheap by Edinburgh standards and you simply get what you pay for.",1
review_84831,drinks,"I had an awful experience here.  It took the cashier 5 minute to punch my order into the cash register, then wasted another couple of minutes explaining to me that they changed their menu and its all \""screwed up\"".  After waiting another 10 minutes for my latte, I finally asked the lady behind the counter if the coffee was going to take much longer because I was in a hurry.  She looked at me with a snare , didn't say a word, then instructed the cashier to refund my money...which I didn't ask for.  As the cashier handed me my refund I said \""I didn't ask for a refund, I just wanted to know how long it was going to take\"".  They both just stared at me without a word, so I said, \""fine.  I find coffee elsewhere\"".  As I was walking out she declared to the customers in line with a giggle \""she DID ask for her money back!'  I will not be going back here.",0
review_158381,drinks,"Got to love the decadent combination of pie and bourbon.  \n\nI came here after a concert at Overture on Thursday night. It was surprisingly empty, yet had the warm welcome feeling. Think of Plaza; it's \""homey\"" in that way. \n\nA waitress greeted me and my date in very pleasant way, and we sat down at one of the booths (love the booths). We ordered warm cherry pie and a sniffer of Knob Creek. The pie had the perfect amount of slightly tart cherry - ah, what more do you want after a great concert? They also have blueberry, pecan, cream pie, and all the other staples. It's not the best pie in the midwest, but does the job to make you purr.",3
review_459122,drinks,"Wow! We're new here and this bakery was a find. Great cup of Capucciono and the Lemon Bar was one of a kind: Shortbread crust, sweet and sour lemon filling with strussel sprinkled on top.",4
review_581905,drinks,"Ok, well, let's get a few things out of the way first.\n\nThis place isn't very big, so there's not much space to do anything. It's also kind of expensive when it comes to drinks around Madison. \n\nSo why am I giving it four stars? Well, a drink purchase here can be used as the cover to get into the Ivory room, and the second, and much more important reason, is that they have shot skis.\n\nSHOOOOOOOOT SKIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIS!!!!!!!!!",3
review_256768,drinks,"I can't believe this place has been here for so long and I am the 1st to review it.  Weird.  Anyways...this place is just ok to me.  I like that its open til 6am, I like that they make strong drinks and the mini TV's at each booth for sports is cool too.  If I was with a group, this isn't a bad place to bs and do shots etc.  But the food just isn't great here.  Its just average Mexican imo.  3.5 stars is what I would give this place if I could.",2
review_97009,drinks,"Always have a good time when we go here, gets freakin' busy during Happy Hours! HUGE selection of TV's! sooo many you dont know what to watch!",2
review_154568,drinks,Payed over 1400 for bottle service and the guy upfront asked for my card even tho we were paying cash. After checking my bank statement I have been charged $15.00 a week since I left Las Vegas. Watch this place lot for scammers! Wouldn't give em ur card!,0
review_486894,drinks,"This is my favorite place in Charlotte. \n\nTheir wine selection is incredible - you can find something fabulous at any price point. The staff is very knowledgeable and more than willing to share their knowledge with you. Mark, the owner, is funny and approachable -  makes you want to support the business even more. The chocolates are excellent and the service can't be beat. What more could you possibly want?\n\nBonus - stop by before or after dinner with friends, there is no additional corkage fee. So if you don't want to do the nightly flight, buy a bottle, get cozy, and enjoy a great evening in the shop.",4
review_455533,drinks,"I really like this place. They call themselves a Korean Barstaurant, and that's pretty accurate. Has the nice cafe feel of one you would find in Korea. Their menu is pretty simple compared to the majority of Korean restaurants around town, but they add a tapas twist to their menu which makes it unique. Their dishes are delicious but unique, so don't expect the typical Korean barbeque when you go here, but something different. It sounds simple, but try their cheesy corn, one of my favorites. Service is a bit slow hence the 4 stars.",3
review_337144,drinks,"Oh yeah had a great time here! I had a few different beers on tap and some were good. Don't remember which ones I tried so don't ask lol.  The band that was playing there Friday night 8-24-12 were awesome, they really rocked out.",3
review_3555,drinks,"I lived next to Teabags for over a year before checking it out and I definitely regret waiting that long. \n\nIt is huge on the inside, tons of bar space and plenty of room to stand and play pool. Clean for a dive bat, private bathrooms downstairs. Excellent jukebox. \n\nStaff has always been a delight, have enjoyed watching hours of random nonsense on tv with them. Prices are dirt cheap. They have a house drink called like the deep blue or something that is jack, schnapps, and curacao, get that you will not regret it.",4
review_180825,drinks,"Let it be known that I only went to the bar (its nice looking, the water theme is cool, chill atmosphere too) at this place with a friend, who ordered a round then we left, so I know nothing about the food or service. What I do know is that when I saw my friend's tab for the two drinks he bought, I told him that I hope he also gets a squeezer or a small home to accompany the drinks or else he is getting royally screwed. Needless to say, he has no condo and no women accosted him as we sipped our small fortunes, so the royal screwing did indeed occur. While I expected the drinks to be expensive at this place, there is no need for a bar to ever approach the $20 per drink ceiling, because once that ceiling is hit all of mankind will be doomed to sobriety until a comet does us in like one did the dinosaurs. Yikes.",1
review_361617,drinks,"If you are looking for a nice, casual place for drinks and app's, this would probably work well. As a restaurant, it does not work.\nThe food was flavorless and bland. The tuna ceviche may have been the worst I have ever eaten.  The only thing you could taste in the fish tacos was the corn tortilla. No spices, no cilantro, no spice, no flavor.\nThe music was just loud enough where you could not really have a decent conversation if you were sitting inside.\nOverall, drinks on the patio would be the only reason I would go back.",1
review_211372,drinks,"Mesa Grill was closed, so we had lunch at Hyakumi instead. The menu was scary... scary overpriced. What restaurant owner can sleep at night when he charges $20 for a sushi roll? I'm not referring to specialty rolls--layered with sashimi and and smothered with caviar and gold flakes--I'm speaking of your basic spider and rainbow rolls.\n\nThe rolls were admittedly oversized and tasty but they hurt... especially when I can get each roll for less than half the price at any neighborhood sushi bar in SF. Shame on Hyakumi!",2
review_354503,drinks,The staff were very nice and attentive - shame the drinks ( flavorless and seemingly devoid of alcohol ) and food were not of the same quality. The food was greasy / and sloppily presented and disappointing.\n\nThere are better options on the Royal Mile,0
review_188584,drinks,"Not a person hung up on sweets, but this place, oh my had amazing things! Yum! \n\nThe chocolates & pastries were amazing! The nice thing is if you need something to offset the sugar rush they have some amazing sandwiches & salads as well. \n\n\nThis place is definitely a grab and go place. We couldn't find anywhere to sit & eat our desserts so we had to opt to take it to a lounge. That was the downfall. We weren't thrilled about eating some yummy treats in a smoke filled lounge. No good, but no choice. :( \n\nIf you have a sweet tooth this is the place for you! If you stay in a nearby hotel they serve breakfast items as well.",3
