review_602656,restaurant,"Kind of ricey even though we didn't order AYCE but they tasted good and fresh. The toastedness of the sasa wasnt my favorite but tge playboy was good. \n\nAaron was great, I think he's the manager.  Good, fast service.",3

review_553423,restaurant,Traditional chain restuarant with your typical menu.  Great location though.....and it was hopping for its grand opening.,1
review_649036,restaurant,"Two words come to mind that best describe my experience: thoroughly disappointing. The ambience is great - the decor is good and the waitstaff were nice enough. If I could end the review there this would be a 5 star review... but oh, the food. \n\nI ordered a staple, Pad Thai. I'm not sure where they went wrong but it was terrible all around. Instead of choosing your protein (as is common with the dish), this chef is confused - they include chicken, shrimp, and something else I couldn't quite make out; the flavor was just 'off' from what Pad Thai should be - that's as best as I can describe it. The spice level also left much to be desired - I ordered 'Thai Hot', the spiciest they have and the dish packed as much punch as a wet noodle, no pun intended. Lastly, the consistency of the noodles was just wrong - either it was too soggy or too wet and the noodles were round instead of flat so it didn't feel quite right in the mouth. \n\nAnd the price? At $14.95, this was the most expensive Pad Thai I've ever had; I wish I could say it was worth it. \n\nOn our way out (based on what I could see), I noticed that they didn't have a single Asian/Thailander working in the kitchen - it just seemed like a bunch of Southerners trying to mimic Asian cuisine; maybe that's why the food didn't have an 'authentic' taste. Maybe I'm being way too harsh/overly critical, but I'll tell you this - this is the first review I've ever given less than 4 stars; that's saying something. \n\nI really wanted to love this place, I did (especially since we live across the street from it), but based on tonight's performance, they're going to have a really hard time winning me back. \n\nOh and did I mention they don't have a lunch service? A Thai place with no lunch - that's like McDonald's with no breakfast.",1
review_643930,restaurant,"I always managed to feel sick after eating here, so I stopped going except for happy hour after work and maybe fries to eat.\n\nService varies. We had great service at first, and then it went downhill and we stopped going so much.  I might try another location, but it's not likely.",2
review_459769,restaurant,"I would give 2 stars but the food is good. Service is terrible slow. Went on a Saturday night took 15-20 minutes to get our beer.  Our server forgot to put in our appetizer and it came just before our meal. The mgr did comp it for us, but still, was surprised the server never checked in with us.  They brought my husbands meal from the kitchen 20 mins prior to our rolls being served, his meal was cold by the time we ate.  He ordered a second beer and they advised him they only had warm glasses and asked of that would be ok.... I come back because the food is good, but the service needs some help!",2
review_509241,restaurant,"Me and my girlfriend walked into this place after Mary Anns diner was full from Unofficial weekend. The chips where not bad, but when i took the first bite after dipping it in the salsa my perception of this place completely changed. The salsa tasted like it was from a can. \n\nThe service was not bad but i think the waiter suspected we were not enjoying our meal. Everything tasted like it was microwaved and on top of that the food was already bad. If i wanted beef tacos, tomato sauce enchiladas, and flavorless rice I would have gone down the street and ate at taco bell for half the price. \n\nTo sum things up, if you want authentic Mexican food, DO NOT GO HERE!",0
review_549211,restaurant,"My boyfriend and I tried this place a week ago.  I loved the theme of the place, since I come from the Northwoods myself.  That was the best part about the place, unfortunately.\n\nThe restaurant was not very full, but service took FOREVER.  The menu was overly large and the prices were overly inflated (especially considering the poor quality of the food).\n\nWe were seated pretty quickly, but it took the waitress a long time to actually visit us.  And then it took another very long time before she came back with our beverages.  And refills took just as long.  Very poor service.\n\nWhen she laid out the menus, the waitress went over the specials.  Seeing that they serve Country Fried Steak, I said it was a shame that they dont serve chicken fried chicken.  The waitress immediately corrected me, and insisted they DO, tapping emphatically on the Country Fried Steak item.  I asked her three times to clarify that what she was pointing at was not chicken, and she kept insisting, \""Yes, it SAYS steak, but this is actually chicken!!!\""  We should have walked out right then, ....buuuuut we didnt.  She finally realized what she was saying and admitted that the Country Fried Steak was not actually chicken, but beef, and that they do not serve chicken fried chicken.  Ugh.\n\nSo, I ordered the breakfast special that day, which amounted to ham steak, hashbrowns, sourdough toast and scrambled eggs with cheese.  My boyfriend ordered a big burger.\n\nWe waited for at least 30 minutes from the time of our order to the time that our food arrived at our table.  The burger arrived cooked as ordered, and my boyfriend ate it, saying it was 'good'.  My breakfast was awful.  The presentation was ugly, because I was expecting to get an entire ham steak, but what I received was a badly cut, fatty partial piece of a ham steak which was cold when it got to the table.  The hash browns were oily, and nothing to write home about.  My sourdough toast was actually burnt to the point of being black and charred across the surface.  The eggs were hot though, and fairly good tasting.  Not worth the price we paid, or the use of the lumberjack name.  \n\nI was physically sick from shortly after we ate, for the rest of that day, and we will not be going back again.  I would suggest that you AVOID this place like the plague, and go to IHOP, or Denny's, or basically any other greasy spoon diner because the price you pay will be far less, and the food will be far better.  Heck, Arizona Charlie's serves the same meal I ordered, but you get an entire ham steak, completely free of fatty bits, for $3.99, their service is prompt, and the waitstaff knows what they do and do not have on their menu.",0
review_122936,restaurant,"Seeked this place out looking for a sit down, but off the path mexi place.  My wife had a whole fried fish (mojarra) and said it was outstanding.  She thought it could have been cooked a touch more, but that indicates to me that they did it just right.\nKids had carne asada tacos plain, no toppings at their request.  They wolfed them down.\nI had two cheese enchiladas topped with their mole sauce.  It was very good.  Service was polite, sincere and prompt.  I would go back in a heatbeat.  After looking at the bill I was even more enthusiastic about this place.  Great job!\n\nWorthy note:  Besides their delicious salsas, they had my wife's favorite bottled hot sauce on tap (Castillos).  That is a first!\n\nStacky Best Of Award\u2122  Mojarra",3
review_235200,restaurant,"Awesome. Actually, half of the owner team is Guatemalan. They also own Milo's in bufu, Urbana but as Escobar is the chef, Escobar's is his place.\n\nI always have a good time with their wine staff, especially the lovely salty gal that has only been tending a short while but swigs wine like a sailor, which is to say she doesn't take a dainty white-glove approach. She's a no-nonsense, straight-up pro that can take in a mouthful of wine and nail the flavor notes without all the swirling and sniffing and sloshing. It's the only time I've been able to say, \""this one tastes like a chewy, sweaty S&M jock strap\"" and have someone know exactly what I mean without further explanation. And despite the fact that she's a beer girl, her vino recommendations (granted the list is not as extensive as other places downtown) are excellent.\n\nI've done a few different things on the menu but I always go back to their duck a l'orange. The meat is always cooked to succulent perfection and maybe it's because everything on the plate is a shade of orange but the entire dish tastes juicy, earthy, bright and warm. Like 6pm sunshine! Like it's made from Care Bears! I want to liquify it, put it in an IV and jack the whole tasty lot right into my veins!\n\nThe mussels are excellent as well and my friend scarfed the ceviche on our last visit (I had my face in the mussels - so much for sharing).\n\nThe bread is baked in house and they have a bombin' spicy corn focaccia so it's easy to load up on table bread guilt-free because you can't nosh on Escobar bread anywhere else but Escobar's.\n\nMost importantly I like this place because the food is so good and the staff is so nice that it doesn't need all the flash and glam of other restaurants to earn five stars on yelp! The closest comparison I have is the cluster of restaurants out in Napa: sun-drenched, family-owned, friendly and in an epic love affair with food. Outdoor seating means gazing into a parking lot as cars zoom by but it is still the only place in Champaign where I am a little saddened at the end of my meal because I don't have four stomachs, four wads of cash and four hours to sit and eat four more servings of Escobar's duck a l'orange.",4
review_502512,restaurant,"Outstanding food.  I placed a small to go order and I showed up 20 mins later to find that I was not ready.  The women there are very nice.  They recently hired some white guy that is a complete douche and needs to fired that runs the register.  that ass hat was just standing there sizing me up the whole time I was waiting.  I thought I was going to have to throw down in the thai restaurant!  Anyways, the dude was unpleasant, rude, and just put me off to the whole place and unfortunately I will not be returning.  Wahoos next door is excellent though :)",1
review_569672,restaurant,"This place is pretty cool, not sure about the food.  When we got there it was not even 6pm and our server told us they were out of Spud Tacos and he would let us know how long before they made more.  We got a flight of beers.  I only liked 2 of the six he selected.  I am not a beer drinker, I like them light and not too hoppy or lemony.  After about 20 minutes we saw another server and asked her to inquire how long before the Spud Tacos were available again.  She came back and said 45 minutes, wow.  How long does it take to cook sweet potatoes in their kitchen?  We were not going to wait for them and we were glad because I read the review on the New Times about an hour later and it was not glowing.  I think this place has potential.  It is a little bit too noisy, I think they should consider putting some noise absorbing tiles.",2
review_396014,restaurant,"The server was terrible here.  She got the orders all wrong, try to save us money by including my meal with someone elses when that person clearly wanted all four of the things in the deal he was getting. Clean location, but bad service.",2
review_480483,restaurant,"I remember seeing the Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives that featured Los Taquitos, but never got the urge to drive all the way down to Ahwatukee to try it out, so when the sign went up in the center near my office I was excited!\n\nThe interior is really modern and they have a huge bar, which from what I hear, is very different from the original location, but they are trying to step it up a notch!  You still order at the counter and get a number, which I love, and take out doesn't take that long either.\n\nI have tried the chicken quesadilla and the carne asada quesadilla and loved them both.  The green salsa goes great with the chicken quesadilla, which was a helpful tip from one of the owners.  One of the best parts of the quesadilla experience here is that it is not greasy at all!  They use a white cheese (jack I think) and use just enough to make it cheesy without overwhelming it with grease, plus they cut them up in cute little squares that makes it great for sharing.  They also have good guacamole.\n\nThe only downside so far is the beans....they are a bit on the runny side....but with so many other options at reasonable prices...I guess I can overlook this!",3
review_189440,restaurant,"What in the world?! How does this place have such positive reviews???? \n\nStaff - SLOW, slow, slow. Other than slow, they looked miserable - I almost felt bad for them.\n\nFood - When walking into a buffet there should be So many items that stick out that Im overwhelmed and can't decide. This was not the case - I actually had a hard time deciding this time because nothing was appealing.  - the only thing that I was slightly excited about was the fried chicken - which btw was also disappointing. It was greasy and flavorless. The lamb was another item that was bad - it was extremely overcooked - dry and jerkylike. I even had a hard time trying to cut it into pieces. I should not be struggling this much. Crablegs were sad - hardly any meat and icy cold. Desserts - not good. The crepes were so sad. The blueberry parfait had the worst texture. Upon first bite, I wanted to throw up.\n\nIn the end, I left the buffet hungry and unsatisifed. This should never be the case when I'm at a buffet.",0
review_604703,restaurant,"The Greek gentleman would not sell me what I wanted. I just wanted to try a leg and thigh before trying an 8 piece. He told  me no repeatedly. \""You must buy 8 piece or dinner.\"" But I didn't want any coleslaw or fries! Just chicken. KFC and Popeye's will let me buy one piece. Is it that hard to price out one piece of chicken? Honestly, I want to know why an owner would not accommodate a potential life long customer! Is this normal business practice? Please someone tell me.\nSanitation rating = 97. Not sure how they got that, cuz the place looked NASTY!!!",0
review_400610,restaurant,"I lived in Los Angeles for 22 years and Dallas for 20 years and have traveled extensively in Mexico, so I consider myself a good judge of GOOD Mexican food.\nWell, Unfortunately I didn't find it at Concina Mendoza. In fact, it serves the worst Mexican food I've ever had. I started out with a beef chile relleno\n and it was awful.\nThe breading on the chile was soggy and bathed in some sort of soupy sauce.\nThe waitress took it back and I was hesitant to order a replacement but went with the simple ground beef burrito thinking how could they mess up a burrito. Well, they did.\nI don't know what the meat was inside but it sure didn't taste like beef. I had 2 bites\nand asked for the check. And by the way, they have a huge sign on the window offering Margaritas for $3.25. When my bill came, they were $5.99. When I questioned why $5.99? the waitress said the $3.25 price was Mon-Thu. Upon leaving I did check the sign and in very small print it does say Mon-Thu but you need a magnifying glass to read it. Taco Bell has far superior food to this place. Don't waste your money here.\nI spent $22.00 with tip for a margarita, some chips & salsa and 2 bites of a burrito.\nI'll never eat here again and will make sure my friends & family don't either.",0
review_189724,restaurant,"We made it to Brunch and the line was ridiculous!! But I had already come to accept that Vegas was just code for lines everywhere. Anywho..\n\nThe food was good. I wish there was a little more of a selection in each cuisine, but I was spoiled by going to the Bacchanal a few days earlier..and this was also Brunch sooo maybe that's why. Their BBQ pork buns in the Asian section were so tasty!! I also tried some kind of beef, I don't know, the cook was hard to hear. But it was juicy and delicious!\n\nMy bf and I were lucky enough to get seating out in the garden room area with all the pretty flowers. The service was pretty good. \n\nOverall, it was a nice brunch and we did stuff our faces. I wouldn't eat that candied apple though, unless you were looking to break some teeth! :P",3
review_310284,restaurant,"First and last time I'll do business with them. \n\nThe pizza I ordered was barely warm, but I was hungry so I threw a few slices in the microwave. When I called to complain, I was put on hold for several minutes and told that the deliveryman had seen it come out of the oven with his own eyes.\nThis didn't change the fact, I told them, that it wasn't hot and, in fact, the cheese wasn't melted at all.\nLater that night, I got the bad news that something else was wrong - I had food poisoning. When I told them yesterday what had happened, they were something less than sympathetic.\n\nIf you value your health, stay away from Lucci's Pizza and Pasta.",0
review_444732,restaurant,"The food was delicious, but they had us waiting 40 minutes after ordering for our food to arrive. When it arrived the server explained that they just finished serving a table of 40 in the back. Why couldn't they tell me when I arrived? Give the patron the choice if we want to wait or not, they knew the wait would be that long.",2
review_339398,restaurant,"This place is a throw back to another time. An ugly time from the 70's and 80's. They haven't changed, but they should. I've often felt like I'm in a prison cafeteria waiting for my portion of food. And if you've been here late enough you even feel like you might have to fight to keep your food!",1
review_99578,restaurant,"Horrible service!!! I had to WAIT...when there only were two people ahead of me. Got my food, went home and was shorted 2 items. I called & the guy said he could give me 2 extra biscuits and a family size okra. REALLY??? for wasting my time and gasoline. REALLY??? I did go back the next day and...WAITED & WAITED. This is the crappiest service ever! I occasionally enjoy the food but I will definitely check my order before I leave, IF I go back to that location. These employees have no sense of priority, BIG PERIOD.",1
review_272993,restaurant,"I ordered a spinach, goat cheese and sundried tomatoe omelet. It was horrible! The cheese was not inside, but on top - cold and unmelted. The omelet was actually more of a fritatta as it was brown all over from being overcooked. I mentioned this to the employee who brought the dish to my table, but my complaint went ignored. Even after eating only one bite of the omelet - it was cold on top of everything else - no one seemed to care. After spending $13 for an omelet and glass of milk, you'd think they'd jump through hoops to make people happy given their prices. Never again. This was my second visit and I was unhappy after my first. Hoping the first visit was a fluke, I gave this restaurant a second chance. Big mistake on my part.\n\nThe employees were very friendly when I ordered, but this isn't enough to make up for the lack of concern  or care over my displeasure. The food is not good and the prices are way too high for what you get.",0
review_158786,restaurant,"Oh man ... this is NOT good pizza ... it's CHEAP and they usually have an all you can eat lunch buffet but the 'za is about as good as Little Caesar's Pizza (i.e. \""not so much\"")",0
review_298034,restaurant,"We purchased the full day buffet special for $32 because we though it would be amazing food at a great price. While it was a good deal, the food was disappointingly average. The lunch and dinner menu were the exact same two days in a row, which got boring really fast.  Lastly, there was a Mexican section [enchiladas, beans, rice...], a Chinese, section [orange chicken, rice, egg rolls...], and an Italian section [spaghetti, meatballs...] with food that looked and tasted like something from Denny's. I recommend you only eat at the buffet once, probably breakfast.\n\nAlso, the dessert buffet was alright; apple pie, frozen yogurt, cheesecake, brownie bites, mousse pie, stuff bought from the store. This buffet is one step above the buffet at the  \""Exacalibur,\"" ...and that isn't saying much.",1
review_402358,restaurant,"So happy with our decision to come here this evening. Sushi in Maricopa made me a bit skeptical, but the food and service were amazing!! Strongly suggest the monkey balls.",3
review_38648,restaurant,"The best sashimi in the valley.  I like the relaxed atmosphere here and not feel rushed to complete my meal.  Best make reservations if you plan on a weekend night out.  Better yet, get there when they open and enjoy happy hour beer pricing.",4
review_319418,restaurant,I ordered on Xmas Eve pizza and wings.  Order was supposed to be delivered at 7:12PM.  I got a call at 7:15PM telling me they didn't prep enough pizza dough and and couldn't fill my order.  The giggling girl on the call was rude and seemed not to care.  \n  They knew when they got my order they couldn't fill it.  They should not have accepted the order.  I see now why Pizza Hut is in such financial trouble.  Bah humbug Pizza Scrooge .   My New Years Resolution is Dominos Pizza!,0
review_317208,restaurant,"One of the best burgers I had in my life. The list of toppings you can add is more than I have ever seen. I had grilled onion rings, tomato, coleslaw, pickles, mayo and mustard on my burger. You can also create your own milkshake and your own salad. So glad my buddy turned me on to this place. Love the old diner feel. The wait for the food to be prepared was a bit too long in my opinion.",3
review_205955,restaurant,"Minus one star ....when you make reservations and specify BALCONY.....you better get balcony! Well, after 20min of waiting for our balcony table, and a stern chat with the GM, we had comped drinks and our table.....but really? If I request something.....just give it to me.....or I'll complain until you do.....",2
review_89402,restaurant,"I picked this place because I thought it would be good for a group setting. The people I traveled with had different dietary restrictions and I like to make sure I can cater to them all. This place worked, but the food was standard. I definitely wasn't expecting mind blowing food, but when it comes to a cafe I'd like the food to be comforting. \n\nMy burger reminded me of a day at the park where you buy frozen burger patties from Costco and throw em on the grill. Where's In-and-Out when I need them? They also wouldn't cook my french fries extra crispy for some reason which was also another negative. The highlight was probably the hot fudge sundae but as a reminder, unless you like eating dessert as dinner, share that sucker with someone. \n\nI'd go here again if I wanted something super casual and laid back. But since I usually travel here with a band wagon of people, I'll have to take them elsewhere.",2
review_626504,restaurant,"In spite of the fact that I wrote a scathing review of Viva Mercado's shortly after their reopening in their newest location, I'm revising because Bobby has made sure that positive changes were made.  \n\nThe food has greatly improved since my early 2014 review. It's just like I remember it if not better, and I'm back to ordering on a regular basis again. \n\nI'm glad I didn't give up on them because they do listen to their customers' concerns and I thank them for that.",4
review_158992,restaurant,"Ive never been a fan of this place but some friends were going there and invited us to come with them.. what the hell, right?\n\nThe service is pretty good here.. very attentive and friendly. Ordered the spinach salad, the dressing was really weird, like a miso dressing with bacon.. didn't work at all. Also ordered a Frisco pizza, thin crust. Well the outer perimeter of the pizza was so dried out that those pieces were just about inedible. Maybe that's how they do it here? I don't remember the pizza's being that dry? The wings were good enough.. plenty of meat and not greasy at all. \n\nI wouldn't go come back to Oregano's unless some friends were going and I was invited. You would have been proud of me, I didn't complain at all!!",1
review_479575,restaurant,"I love this place. Not your typical breakfast. You have to go in knowing that you may or may not get a seat, you will probably wait in line, but the waffles are amazing. I don't do coffee, but the hot chocolate and a naked waffle on a cold morning sure hits the spot.",4
review_82994,restaurant,"Every aspect of our breakfast at Dino's was phenomenal. As some other reviews have mentioned, the staff were incredibly kind, warm, and attentive. The waitress for our table was vigilante about refilling coffee and water cups, and she gave us four extra halves of fresh buttered toast on the house!\n\nThe food came out incredibly quickly. And every single thing was incredibly delicious. The one item that stood out above the rest was the biscuit gravy. If you have a meal here you should seriously consider incorporating the gravy into your meal somehow, it was phenomenal.\n\nLastly, the menu is reasonably priced, arguably cheap. I paid $9 before tip for two eggs, two pork chops, hash browns and toast. I think the biscuit with gravy (generous portion) was around $2, not positive though.",4
review_97598,restaurant,"I don't understand why everyone likes this place so much. This place is called burrito express and we had to wait like 20 minutes to get our food, with no one in front of us. I got the steak and salsa burrito my fiance got the machaca burrito. His was like 3 times the sizes of mine and my cheese wasn't even melted. My burrito wasn't terrible but it wasn't good. My fiance's burrito was so disgustingly greasy he couldn't even finish it and he loves greasy food, we wouldn't even want to give it to our dog. It looked disgusting! He just threw the other half away and felt sick the rest of the day. We ordered some chips and salsa and they threw a couple table spooned size salsa containers in the bag, which wasn't enough for the chips. We asked for more and they charged us extra for each salsa! The salsa tasted terrible! They also charge you extra for using a credit card. I wouldn't go back.",1
review_469004,restaurant,"I have visited this establishment more times than I can count, but never by choice. Birthdays, farewell parties, and casual get-togethers. I groaned every time as I prepared myself to go. I'll explain - nothing I've eaten has impressed me in any way. The nachos are okay (essentially, I've had better and cheaper!); the fried clams, quesadillas, fries, etc. all just merit a \""meh\"" from me (although, the hand rolled stuffed jalapenos were pretty good). HOWEVER, the reason I gave it three stars is because I finally tried their \""world famous\"" wings/zingers on my most recent trip and WOW - delicious!! Crispy with great flavor, not to mention their great sauces (that you can also combine, thus the possibilities are endless; I mixed 'medium' with 'BBQ' that evening) that you just want to lick off your fingers! It definitely threw me for a loop that a place I thought I'd sworn off is the same place I want to revisit for unforgettable wings.",2
review_395255,restaurant,"The mango curry with chicken is VERY TASTY, however not the most complex curry flavor I have ever experienced.  However it also had very little mango flavor, and the predominant flavor was certainly from the acorn squash, and a little from the pineapple.  Ordered it as \""medium\"" spicy, and in my opinion it was not spicy at all, not even a little heat.  Will order it as \""hot\"" next time.  Got takeout on a friday night and I am very glad we did because the restaurant was so packed I had trouble even spotting the counter through the mass of people standing  by the door waiting for  a table. Very affordable too, my curry was only $10 and was huge :)",3
review_234388,restaurant,"Good food, reasonable $$$$, and more important a good staff and mgmt.    we go almost on a weekly basis, and we always get a wave from the mgr and other servers.  Very friendly place.  Good margaritas!!!!!!",3
review_228682,restaurant,"Nice place for a quick bite to eat or a nice dinner, nice area to grab a drink and meet up with friends.  The atmosphere is a little more grown up than the strip, pretty and relaxing overall. Clean and doesn't smell all smoky like some of the other casinos.",3
review_625848,restaurant,"I've tried this restaurant a few times with friends and it is so disappointing every time. I'm no longer interested in giving them a shot. The food is sub-par at best and the prices are too high. \n\nCase in point, I ordered pancakes and I don't know how it's possible to mess up a pancake, but they were able to do just that. Who serves a pancake with cayenne pepper all over it and doesn't warn a customer who orders it?! Food allergies, anyone?! That's just not smart. It was beyond gross as well. They never even offered to replace the pancakes or bring anything else as a substitute. When I asked for a small biscuit, they told me, \""they wouldn't charge me this time.\"" Is that a threat?! Please.... Go back to Asheville. You can keep this place. I'm not sure Charlotte wants to embrace you and I can tell you that I surely won't.",0
review_279910,restaurant,"Don't waste your time going here!!!\n\nI came in for late lunch around 3pm and stood in the doorway for almost 10 minutes till I was greeted.  Three servers were too busy standing around doing nothing by the food window but gossip than to acknowledge, greet, and seat me.\n\nAfter I finally got a table, the server I had was fine...she seemed busy with other tables and since I was alone, I guess I was not a priority.  I finally placed my order after waiting what seemed like forever.\n\nPlease be advised, if you order a burger, you can ONLY get them cooked well done!!!!  The server said it was a restaurant rule!  I tried a Burogi ( a burger with 2 Pierogis on top of it), and although it had decent flavor, it would have been better if not cooked well done.  \n\nShe dropped my check only after I had to flag her down and ask her for it.  I had to get to the river cruise that was next door.\n\nI should have just gone to one of the chain restaurants that was in Station Square, but wanted to try a Pittsburgh place.  If you want bad service and overcooked burgers, than this is the place to go!!!!",1

review_2248,restaurant,"It was raining and we were in the Strip district craving some seafood.  We decided to stop by Roland's Seafood Grill.\n\nWe were seated right away close to the bar in front of the big screen projector where the US open was playing.

We were glad for the US Open entertainment.\n\nMy dad order the clam chowder soup, which was chunky and bare of any clams.

If you are caught in the rain and do not have any other choices in the strip area, stop by.  I would recommend scoping out the other restaurants in the area.",1
review_345227,restaurant,"Last week, I drove by Villa Francesca, I said out loud, \"" I want that restaurant to have great pizza by the slice.\""  I tried it tonight and it was outstanding.  A fresh pizza came out of the oven and I ordered a slice.  I sat outside on a bench and ate my pizza. It was a little thicker than \""thin\"" crust, topped with crushed tomatoes, fresh basil and mozzarella.    The owner came out and introduced himself and offered me another slice!!  It's good to be a girl!\nI don't think I want to eat pizza anywhere else in CLT.  My slice was $3.  The menu dinner items were $10-$15.  I can't wait to go back.  They are open on Sunday and outside seating.",4
review_634796,restaurant,I really like this place! The food is reasonably priced and very tasty. Their take on palak paneer is one of the better ones I've had. The staff is very friendly and really go above and beyond to make sure you are happy.,3

review_524822,restaurant,"It's food on the strip. When is food on the strip ever 5 star worthy? Never. \n\nI got the lobster grilled cheese with cajun fries. The lobster grilled cheese was pretty good for what it was but it wasn't amazing. Like everyone else said, I wish there was more lobster meat in it. 2 stars for that.\n\nAdded an additional 1 star for their cajun fries. The best cajun fries I've ever had. It was actually SPICY. I'd probably just only get their cajun fries next time as a snack and nothing else.",2

review_101678,restaurant,"You know how your wife or girlfriend is always whining about how you never listen to them? This of course as a shoe comes whistling past your cranium.\nWell The Tortilla Factory must have the same listening skills....their management never listens either.\n\nYou would think that after 111 reviews, someone over there would recognize there's a problem with the service. \nNope.\nThis would lead one to conclude no-one in management knows about Yelp, or, and I suspect this is more the case, they can't read,\n\nPrior to writing this, I read some of those 111 reviews in an effort to see how my experience last night paired-up.\nUncannily, it was true to form, explaining why this place gets two and a half stars.\n\nService was bad with waiters only stopping by to sell more drinks.\nHad to ask for the tortillas twice before ever seeing them..appx 20 minutes waiting on the free tortillas.\nHey TF, do I need to remind you of your namesake???\n\nAnd the prices for the amazingly tasteless food will stupefy you. (I sampled everyone's food in our party of eight) \n\nOld Town Tortilla Factory...you're really one sneaky bastard.\nLaying in wait....for all the unsuspecting Scottsdale visitors looking for the 'Mexican Food' experience, and instead ambushing them with your bad service, high prices and tasteless garbage you call food.\n\nBut you do have some nice attributes, which is why, similar to my situation of never listening, I still have a wife.\nOnly I'm not sure how a fountain, large patio and a cutesy margarita cup are going to keep you in business.\nOh well, who cares...right?\nThere'll be another plane full of visitors headed your way tomorrow. \n\nAre you related to Rustlers Roost by any chance? \nYou both have so much in common.",0
review_30648,restaurant,"I've been to this place many of times. The atmosphere is old and run down, the service is slow, coming from a server myself, and it takes forever for them to run credit cards. I have been over charged multiple times! The food though it always good! Save your money on alcohol though they can't makes drinks at all here. Stick to the beer.",1
review_352908,restaurant,"I wanted to give this a 3.5 star review, but alas I've opted to round down rather than up. The setting is very nice indeed and I can see that it would be equally well suited to a busy evening crowd as it was to our Sunday brunch gathering. The food looked good and they use tasty fresh ingredients - I had a full Scottish, though would have loved it to be a bit fuller with perhaps a second rasher or a little more toast.\n\nThere were a few touches that could have been overcome. I understand that they very rarely take reservations, so it was a surprise to hear that they couldn't add an extra table to our setting when the place was all but empty at the time. Nevertheless the staff were friendly and bright on a sunny morning, prompt with our orders and the bill, and quick with answers to our various questions. (Yes, you can opt for a fruit juice instead of the tea/coffee with the big breakfast.)\n\nHamilton's looks very Christmassy and is a lovely place to rest a while before a stroll round Stockbridge Market or the Water of Leith.",2
review_351837,restaurant,"Pretty mixed I'd say, had the green tea soba dish, it was pretty flavorful but the vegetables, snowpeas and green beans mostly, were waaaaay undercooked. With only a small amount of these really thin soba noodles, it was like chewing through hunks of wood, and too much cilantro, every so often you'd just chomp down on an entire sprig of it it seemed. Still tasted pretty good though, just needs some refining. \n\nThe juice drink I had was really interesting and I liked it quite a bit. It was agave and Ginger, which gave it a nice bite but was still very refreshing and light feeling.\n\nOverall it was not a bad experience, the atmosphere was nice (with the right company) and the wait-staff seemed helpful.  But for the price I would expect a little more concentration on their cooking not just the ingredients...",2

It you have ever had real Italian food or lived on the East Coast, you know better than to fall for those stupid commercials with the 12 Italian family members shouting across the table to one another while enjoying an Olive Garden meal.

review_587544,restaurant,"The one star in my review is for the quick smile and greeting we received immediately upon entering. After saying hello, the hostess asked if we had a reservation. \""Nope,\"" I replied, \""just wanted to stop in.\"" She then asked if we would prefer to sit at a table or the bar. \""A table would be great,\"" I said. \""Well,\"" responded the hostess, \""we're very busy tonight (which I totally got, I mean, the bar and the dining room were completely empty), so we do ask that you be respectful of that.\"" Excuse me??? \""I'm sorry, I don't understand?\"" I asked, looking for clarification. \""Oh, never mind. Would you prefer a table or a booth?\"" Umm, how about neither. Sorry lady, not so confident the food at this establishment will wash away that bad taste you just put in my mouth.

review_130690,restaurant,Nice experience if you can afford it. Wine $50 minimum. Dinner $200 plus for 4. A little disappointed as they placed us in a corner so we did not have a direct view of the fountains. Make sure to reserve that. Also go early as they had run out of fried calamari so we had to get the antipasto appetizer. It was ok. Had 3 pasta dishes- great homemade pasta.,2

review_635158,restaurant,Food was delivered wrong and cold. I know this place is new and is going to have growing pains but. ... Lots of employees wanting to seat you and no paper towels in bathroom and trash can full? ???? Staff tried to be nice but is obviously more interested in customers money than great service or food. After speaking to manager who said thank you for complaint but never offered apology. Seems customer relations training is in order. I have been to lots of Buffalo wild wings and this is not the top notch service that I am accustomed to. Also they need to keep in mind when hiring staff there are two bars with mediocre food and service within 1/4 mile with more attractive employees.,1
review_480027,restaurant,Ordered take out and everything was great. I had the sweet and sour pork which and chicken with garlic sauce. Both tasted amazing. I also got fried wantons and they threw in a free order of crab wantons. I did order soup but they forgot to put it in so I will check my order before I leave next time. Other than that everything is fresh and you could tell it was made to order. I will definitely go back. The building looked to be well clean and the last at the front desk was very nice.,3

review_491242,restaurant,"This review is going to cover both of my experiences at 'I Love Burgers'.\n\nThe first time was in January 2012. I am a bit of a burger fanatic, so when my buddy and I saw this restaurant while walking through the Palazzo, we had to stop and try it.\nMy first impression was that the dining area is too sterile and it was packed! But the true question was how are the burgers? They did not disappoint. We ordered the Fried Mac & Cheese Noms to start. They are VERY small, but the flavor was fantastic. On to the burgers!\nWe ordered three so we could cut them in half and try a variety. Caprese Burger, Wagyu Kobe Burger, and the Oregon Trail Burger. As well as Sweet Potato Fries.\nThe Caprese Burger was cooked perfectly, as were all the patties, however the balsamic reduction was a bit much. There was quite a bit on the burger and feel a little less would have added to it. Sometimes less is more. That was the case here. 2 star burger.\nThe Wagyu Kobe burger was good.... But not $25 good. The patty was juicy and flavorful but it didn't make my eyes roll back in my head like Kobe Beef should. The Truffle Cheese was a fantastic addition, after all, Truffle cheese is amazing all on it's own! I didn't care for the pretzel bun at all. 3 star burger.\nThe Oregon Trail burger was great! I make Bison Burgers on average of once a week at home. For those that haven't tried Bison, you are doing yourself an injustice. Bison is lower in Fat, lower in Cholesterol, Higher in Protein and in Minerals. Has an amazing sweet taste, and is so JUICY!!!!  Back to the burger.... We ordered it with caramelized  onions to soften them up and take the edge off a bit. The result was a spectacular burger. Juicy, perfectly cooked, flavorful, with a perfect amount of roasted garlic aioli. The Wheat bun was firm enough to hold the burger together, yet not so dense that it took away from the tender patty. 4+ star burger.\nSweet Potato Fries were great. Dusted with the perfect amount of cinnamon and brown sugar. \nSo, over all, the first visit deserved 3 1/2 stars. Being there are no half stars on yelp, let's call is 4 stars, as it was better than 'A-Ok'.\n\nThe second visit was last week. This time I knew what I wanted. I walked in around 5:30 pm. The place was DEAD! And it remained dead for the hour and a half that I was there.\nI sat down, placed my order of Mac & Cheese Noms, an Oregon Trail Burger with Caramelized Onions cooked medium rare, and Sweet Potato Fries.\nThe Noms came out pretty quick. They were as good as I remembered. Still a bit small, but, good nonetheless. Then came the fries and burger. Fries were luke warm at best. Some were even a bit soggy. It was bad. Just bad. However, the burger was worse. My previous experience of a perfectly cooked Medium-Rare burger was a memory. What I received was what appeared to be a juicy Buffalo Patty, but in reality was a dry piece of shoe leather. After my first bite, I cut into the burger to view a grey DRY overcooked $18 burger that my dog would have rejected. I squeezed the patty and not one drop of any type of liquid could be found. This was a first degree burger felony! \nFor the remainder of my stay at the Venetian, I stayed clear of 'I Love Burgers'. Granted this could be an isolated incident. But it was so bad that it wasn't worth taking the chance. This visit was not only zero stars, but, I would go so far as to give it multiple negative stars.\nThe WORST burger I have EVER had. And I've had some pretty bad ones.\nBecause of the good first experience, I have given it 2 stars. Otherwise it would be one star. I don't think I will ever give it a third shot.",1
review_641783,restaurant,I'm torn cause the good was as good as the one in Town Square but the service was mediocre at best.

review_630516,restaurant,"Went for lunch today with my wife. We both had the steak pitas. I had hummus and pita chips and she had the baked fries. \n\nFirst off, it was a bit confusing what you were supposed to do when you walked in. That was rectified by very courteous and helpful staff. It might help to have a small \""order here\"" sign. \n\nSecond, hummus is a side by itself?  Who orders just hummus?\n\nNow, for the food:\nReally like the idea of baked fries - it fits the theme just fine. The bad part is that is was not well executed - not very hot and not crispy at all. \n\nThe steak on both of our sandwiches and the salsa that my wife had on hers suffered from the same problem: no seasoning. The best word that I can come up with is bland. That certainly doesn't fit with an \""evolved\"" Greek menu. \n\nThe fresh made pita bread was very good and could be the foundation of some really good food - but it has to have some taste.",1
review_33935,restaurant,"I have been coming here for many years. The food have 99% of the time been so good. I usually do take out. Because of the language barrier they can seem a little rough around the edges. I am rating strictly on my experience today with take out. The food was excellent, the service was ridiculous. I walked in to get my food which was sitting there. There were 2 people at one table in the restaurant and no workers in site. After standing there a couple of minutes, I opened the door to see if it had a bell on it. Don't think so. But then in the far back corner with their back turned to me I see movement. A guy watching tv while he is eating. He took his sweet time and got up and headed to the front. Didn't say hi, just named my food and the dollar amount. I jokingly said you guys need a bell. He handed me my change and food and didn't respond and proceeded to leave the front desk before I even turned to leave. He didn't say thank you or nothing. As he walked away I said \""thank you\"" sarcastically. Seriously, how rude. I am so sorry I was interrupting his dinner... If I get customer service like this one more time, I will NEVER be back - yes good food or not - nothing aggravates me more than lazy bad customer service. This guy should not be allowed up at the front desk until he learns the urgency of a customer coming in and his manners.",0
review_173289,restaurant,"Awesome brunch. I have been here in the past for dinner and was not impressed, but brunch time... whoa! hola! \n\nMy favorite dish was the Chicken and waffles - roasted chicken, bacon and chive waffle,Tahitian vanilla bean butter, sauce chasseur. This wasn't even my dish and I kept reaching over to steal a bite. The chicken is sooo flavorful and tender. \n\nI ordered the Special which was scrambled eggs with wild shrimp, spinach, hollandaise sauce and brioche toast. Delish! the sauce was amazing and worked so well with the sweet little shrimps. \n\nProbably the best meal I had this vegas trip. \nI want more chicken and waffles!!! :P",4

review_216169,restaurant,"Jason and I love trying new places and really like when our friends and Twitter followers suggest new places for us to try. So far, we have been very lucky and a most of the suggestions have been awesome. The Oyster Bar at Palace Station was one of those great suggestions.\n\nBe prepared to wait in line, it is a small setup in the middle of the casino and can seat about 10 to 12 people. There is usually one cook behind the \""bar\"" and one additional server. There are no reservations but you will find a line. From what we hear, there is always a line and after our visit we understand why.\n\nWe had a chance to try a few things off their menu and cannot wait to try more on our next visit. The oysters and clams on the half shell are super fresh and shucked to order right in front of you. Their clam chowder is solid, very creamy and hearty. The main courses were unreal. We had the Palace Shrimp Pan Roast and the \u00c9touff\u00e9e. Both had generous helpings of seafood with very distinctive flavors, and can be ordered at the heat level that best suits you. We ordered a six on the heat level, which can go as high as 10. We like hot and this was almost perfect but I think we will do a 7 the next time. But be careful, the heat level is serious.\n\nThe service was really good, more relaxing than I expected. The cook kept us entertained while he prepared our entrees. If you head to Las Vegas, make sure you check this place out.",4

There's always about a 20 minute wait and sometimes the salad bar can get crowded.  \n\nRecommend taking a short drive away from the strip and check this place out.  It's a great place to take a date, but make sure you both bring your appetite.",4

review_341406,restaurant,"YUMMMMIEEEEEEE!!!! Make reservations early! This placed is packed everyday they are open.

The gravy was delicious the cheese curds, beyond expectation, the foie gras was seared to perfection. \n\nCrab Pie - Flaky and buttery pie crust filled with layers of scalloped potatoes, cream sauce, tons of stone crab meat, and topped with green salad. The combination was to DIE for. I wanted to finish everything but could not manage. The portion size astronomical. \n\nSteak Frites - If you like Bison, you will enjoy this dish. Cooked rare with mushrooms and onions in a wine reduction. The main dish also comes with a tall cone of frites. \n\nButter Cake Pudding - This dessert was a bit too sweet and buttery for our taste. We may have enjoyed it more if we actually had room for dessert. \n\nOver all I would highly recommend this place to anyone in the mood for fantastic, no fuss french contemporary cuisine.",3
review_164811,restaurant,"the rating and the following was based on my experience in 2009.  i heard the menu has since changed, and the meals i had are no longer on the menu.  bummer.\n\n********************************************\nI've been to Palm more than a few times, and i was never disappointed!\n\nI had their club member special, which includes a salad, half and half of cottage fries and onion rings, and an order of their Filet Mignon Oscar style.\n\nThe salad was pretty standard, mixed greens tosses with light vinegrette.  It definitely went great with their assorted bread basket, which has a white chocolate bread that I've never had anywhere else!  I'd go back just for that bread!\n\nFor those of you who don't know what cottage fries are, they're basically hot-off-da-fryer-fresh thick cut potato chips.  The serving is huge!  The plate was piled high with them fries, then topped off with another pile of  strings of thinly battered and fried sweet onion that has a perfect balance of crunchiness and sweetness.  I'd go back just for them fries and rings too!\n\nOscar style Filet Mignon, where do I start!

review_36740,restaurant,"The place really is a gem.. Outside patio, great chips good salsa and they have a deal that if you join their club and sample all their tequilas you get a cartoon caricature with your name painted on a wall inside the bar. Food is usually good (but inconsistent), service during the summer was awesome. Service during the winter is obviously not as good. Always clean, nice fresh atmosphere and reasonable prices. Separate restaurant area from the bar for family dinning and the patio always works on mild days. I hope they can regroup in the kitchen and get the servers trained so they can get the consistency back on track. I rated them for their past not present conditions in the hope they will get it together. Oh and Elise was awesome as a waitress.",3
review_81972,restaurant,"Mmmm brunch. It's difficult to find a spot in Charlotte that will take reservations for Sunday brunch - but Providence Cafe welcomes them. This is mighty helpful as the church crowd positively takes over so many Charlotte eateries after 11 am...\n\nHubs and I met some friends for Sunday brunch and I was quite excited to try their fare, as Providence Cafe had just been featured in Charlotte magazine. From the outside, the cafe looks like an upscale eatery, with a stucco like (or just stucco) outside and parking on two sides of the building. It's a bit tucked away from the street, so make sure you look towards the back for extra parking. \n\nWe were seated promptly in the largest booth I've ever sat in. It could have easily sat eight people, therefore the four of us had plenty of space. Service was prompt and friendly - they let the four of us gab and only came over to refill our beverages and check on us just a few times. I was super excited to try their Oscar Omelette - an omelet stuffed with lump crab meat, cream cheese, asparagus and topped with Hollandaise. \n\nWhen the food arrived, the portions were nicely sized and the food looked fresh. My omelette was a bit disappointing, while the flavors were nice, there was too much Hollandaise and there was no texture difference in the omelette. Maybe more asparagus would have helped? But. the cream cheese and crab were just a bit too mushy for my liking. \n\nWhile the dish I chose wasn't my favorite breakfast item, I'd definitely like to go back and try something else on the menu. Their strawberry and almond french toast looked tasty.",2

review_604672,restaurant,"This place has an awesome vegetarian/vegan menu option!! My friends and I ordered veggie springs rolls for appetizers, then we ordered the red curry, pad thai, pad see eew, and Mongolian tofu for our entrees.  Everything was very tasty.  We ordered half of the dishes spicy ( red curry & pad thai)  and boy it was spicy!!  I can't really handle spicy so I ordered the Mongolian tofu and pad see eew with a spice level of 1.. ha.  All of this was $43!!!!!!  so the price is right!! LOL. \n\nThe service was good.  The waitress was very friendly and came back to check up on us.  She even refilled our water glasses without us having to ask.\n\nThe ambiance is not really there... but it doesn't matter too much to me.. just as long as the food is good.  I love that this restaurant caters to the vegan lifestyle.  The whole back of the menu is for vegetarians/vegans.  The front of the menu has all the meat options. \n\nI am definitely coming back to this place to try more dishes... i even wanna hit up the lunch menu!! I recommend this place and give the vegetarian.vegan menu a try.. it was not disappoint.",4
review_635822,restaurant,"Shabu is excelling in many areas, and faltering in just a few. The most glaring area for improvement is in the service arena. They don't come around as frequently as they should and they keep the broth levels really low. This causes the items to stick to the bottom of the hot pot and burn. After your initial pot of broth, they refill it with pork or chicken broth - which is about the same cost as tap water - so they need not be so stingy with it.\nMy favorite items were the enoch mushrooms and pork dumplings. Everything else was OK, but those two items were delicious. I wasn't a big fan of the oval noodles, but my husband loved them, so we'll probably get them again. I also think it's important for the gentleman to tell you not to add too much to the broth before you start dumping large quantities of meat and veggies in... not after.\nFor four of us, it was $93 - and at $50/per couple, there's some room for improvement :)",2
review_173977,restaurant,"More over-hyped celebrity chef food.  \n\nI had called in the morning to inquire about reserving a table on the patio to see the fountains, and the hostess told me they don't reserve those tables, I would just have to show up and ask to be seated there.  So I asked if I should go ahead and make a regular reservation for dinner if that was my plan and she said it wouldn't be necessary.  Well my husband really wanted to eat here, so we called a little later to make a reservation just in case, and they told us the only time left they had was 9:30pm!!  Good thing we called, or I don't even know if we would have gotten in!!  So we showed up early just in case and a different hostess very rudely said they were no longer taking names for the patio because there were too many people already on the list.   Fine, whatever.  When she takes us to our table, we're the only table open that does NOT have a view out the window so I ask if we can be seated at one of the other tables instead, and she (again) rudely tells me no, those are all reserved.  Argh.  \n\nAnyway, we thoroughly enjoyed most of the stuff in the bread basket and the olive tapenades that accompanied while we waited for our food.  People weren't kidding when they said portions were big here!!  Definitely plan on splitting everything!  \n\nOur first dish was the soft shell crab with the watermelon panzanella.  This sounded really interesting, but did not execute at all.  The soft shell crab was soggy and did not taste fresh, and the watermelon/olive/whatever else was in the salad was just a cacophany of mismatched flavors.  We forced down the crab and I ate the watermelon pieces but we left the rest.  \n\nMy husband's dish was less than memorable; I think it was the ricotta ravioli.  A giant bowl of tasteless pasta, with tasteless sausage.  If it hadn't been so blah, I would have been happy to trade my beef tenderloin au poivre with him.  It was a ginormous piece of meat, and while it was cooked properly, it just had no flavor, other than the mounds of cracked peppercorns encrusting it.  Did not taste like tenderloin quality AT ALL.  I figured I should be safe with the most expensive thing on the menu, but nope.  We left quite a bit of that too, which is pretty rare because my husband will go to great lengths not to waste food.  It was only edible slathered in the curried bisque that came with it.  The coconut yogurt sauce was just a tiny drop of white in a sea of orange.  \n\nIt was after dinner that our waiter turned a pretty bad experience around.  Since it was getting so late, most of the people on the patio had left, and he told us to get our things and that we were going to sit by the fountains!!!!  That was a real treat--we got to watch the last three or four shows before it stopped at midnight.   The entire meal experience surely would have been enhanced had we been out there the whole time!!!  So we ordered up a vanilla souffle and some drinks and THOROUGHLY enjoyed the rest of our evening out there.  The souffle was very yummy, by the way.  I haven't had too many souffles but this was tops for me.   \n\nSo the gorgeous ambience, great view, and yummy souffle contributes three stars...but the rest of our food was pretty crappy.  Three stars might be high but that view almost makes up for it.",2
review_119097,restaurant,"Pizza pizza pizza! \n\nSo Papa Johns isnt orgasmic or anything but I do love the specials they run! I normally get the 2 med 2 tops for 11$ Thats seriously a steal! We usually end up getting one with ham and extra cheese and the other is usually pretty random. Chicken with jalapenos on half and Hawaiian on the other. The toppings are always super yummy and not scarce. I love how they load on the cheese!\n\nIts usually a 15-25min wait depending on how busy they are. What I love about this PJs is the customer service. The greeter lady is seriously super kind, she acknowledges you by your first name if she knows it and is super pleasant. The workers here are also very nice and say hello upon entering. I usually always order from their app or the website on my phone. For the super bowl if you were a club member they sent you a coupon for a free large 1 top and a 2 liter! UM YES!! Its promos like that that win my heart : ) If youre a member of the pizza club you can also earn points towards free pizza! AWESOME!\n\nI'm not saying the pizza is amazing, but the deals and customer service are most def amazing! Good job guys!",4
review_28334,restaurant,"We have been going to Eastwind for years and have always enjoyed it. I'm not sure what has happened recently (I heard new management? ) but it has been going down hill fast. The final straw was when I went in on a Sunday evening to order a simple teriyaki chicken bowl and was charged over $12! I asked why and was told the \""bowl\"" is now a lunch menu item and dinner is a \""combo\"" with a salad. When I got my to go order I had to ASK for the salad (after all I did pay an additional $6 for it). When I got home I saw that all the SMALL (4\"" \u00d7 4\"" container)  salad is was only lettuce with lots of bad celery- I took two bites and threw it out! The chicken was also just blah.  So disappointed.  I won't be back.",0
review_188706,restaurant,"The month before last was Bradley Ogden's last at Caesars. Todd Williams has enamored me with his food for the better half of the last decade from my frequent trips to Vegas and for all of the culinary standouts along the strip, I'm saddest to see Bradley Ogden go.\n\nThere was never a dull day in this Michelin Star monster of a Vegas restaurant. Caesars always had my nod, but it was Bradley Ogden that had attention. The food was excellent, incredible by some standards but nothing less than outstanding by any means. The same bodes for the rest of the establishment, easily among the strip's finest.\n\nIt didn't matter if you were a first time patron or a high status player, the service made sure everyone was well taken care of from the beginning to the end of their experience. The restaurant wasn't large, but it was beautiful in its own way - contemporary, sophisticated, and elegant up from the chic decor to the personalized table sets.\n\nLike any high end restaurant, the menu was a seasonal hodgepodge of various creative edible outputs; the kind of food that is beyond anything typical, with little to nothing to reference for folks with novice palates. It's hard to pick a favorite meal when every plate had its own unique twist on it. Everything from a blue cheese souffle to their legendary burger to a seared foie gras with a scallop and potato puree had me dying for more. There wasn't anything that didn't tickle my tastebuds in a way where it didn't leave anything less than a stellar impression.\n\nR.I.P. Bradley Ogden.",4
review_272614,restaurant,"So for people from the Bay, Hot N Juicy Crawfish is a bit of a fusion of Red Crawfish on Larkin in SF and Boiling Crab in San Jose. Same concepts of your choice of spiced seafoods and appetizers, minus the one hour wait of Boiling Crab (at least the time that I went there). Our party of four was seated with hardly a five minute wait. Spicy. Spicy. Spicy. LOVED it. \n\nThe only advice I have for future patrons are:\n1) If you go and plan on going out after, PLEASE do yourself a favor and either bring a large bottle of Listerine and cologne/perfume OR\n2) Go with enough time to go home/back to your hotel for a nice, LONG shower to cleanse the smelliness from your hair, body and a fresh change of clothes!",3
review_133140,restaurant,Awesome customer service. We visit this place every time we are in vegas. But on Dec 24th they only had dinner buffet and when we told the manager (Laddi) we were leaving cause we couldn't order our favorite dish (malai paneer) he had the kitchen make it for us!! We felt so special and taken care of!! U guys gotta try this place! U wont be disappointed!!!,4
review_341526,restaurant,"God bless this place and its affinity for serving you things with the head still on or in cans. On our first visit I was obsessing over the Duck in a Can, which didn't disappoint...I had cold sweats everyday for two weeks after, needing my fix. \n\nThe Foie Gras poutine is something I've been actively campaigning to get in every restaurant in the US or at least our immediate area, but unfortunately, I can't get any of these dicks on board. \n\nOur second trip, my boyfriend and I ordered the Guinea Hen to share. After the heart stopping experience I had; unknowingly moving the whole head still casually attached to the bird, we dug into what would be one of the most delicious things we will ever eat. Thank god they give you a side I extra gravy, the giant pool of it at the bottom of the 8 quart La Crouset pan probably wouldn't do. \n  \nIf I lived in Montreal I would be outside this place everyday selling myself for poutine and sugar pie.",4
review_16801,restaurant,"I absolutely love this place. I was just there last week! In all honesty, the area is not the best, nor is the actual building. Although, once inside, depending on the time of the day, it usually is fairly clean, and the employees are very nice. I personally do not speak Spanish, but I have been coming for so long that they recognize me. But don't be alarm, most employees speak fairly good English. \n\nThough the location is questionable, the food is delicious! I LOVE their Carne Asada Burritos and this is the ONLY place I go to get a burrito. There homemade Flour Tortillas are to die for, as I am VERY picky when it comes to Tortillas. I don't go ANYWHERE else for a burrito. They also have very good Tortas too. So, don't let the location make you hesitate, it will be worth it if you LOVE a good burrito. \n\nThe Carne Asada Burrito has Beans, Carne Asada, Pico De  Gallo, and Guacamole. And before I forget, their Red Sauce has a very different taste than something you would get at Phillibertos or any other Mexican Food Restaurant. This Red Sauce goes PERFECTLY with their Carne Asada Burrito.",4
review_574798,restaurant,"Just had Ezekial's fried chicken and several side dishes by take-out last night. It was very good!

review_557387,restaurant,"Walking up to this place it has a great ambivalence and it is fairly busy. The pizza is on display and it looks delicious. I chose the white pizza and side salad and my husband selects a different type of pizza and an order of french fries.\n\nAnd then we wait.....and wait some more....now people behind us are getting their food...My husband decides to question where our order is being that it has already been 15 minutes and we are the only ones not eating. The gentleman says that our order is held up because of the french fries but should be coming up shortly.\n\nSo we waited again....and watched two other people go up and place their order.....and we waited.....I......haaaaaaaaatttttteee......waaaaiiiitttiinnnnggg........! Oh and by now the other two people who had JUST ordered are now being called up and they are retrieving their order. Guess what it is!?!? Any guesses anyone!?!??!!? TWO ENORMOUS ORDERS OF FRENCH FRIES!!! But oh no our order is still not up. Seriously....My husband goes up again to question the man at the counter and he told me that they decided that they're not going to be making any more of the type of pizza that I had selected so I just wasn't going to get pizza tonight. Right....well thanks for letting us know after we have sat here for 45 minutes hungry.\n\n I am not sure if they just did not understand that you need to tell your customers that they will not be eating that night because you're refusing to make their pizza, or if they expected us to read their minds and then try to come up with a different solution.\n\nWell the ONLY solution that I discovered about this situation was to remove myself from it completely and hope that somewhere else in Las Vegas can serve some decent pizza with some CUSTOMER SERVICE SKILLS!",0

review_418631,restaurant,"Ordered delivery from here. Decent delivery time to Holiday Inn Billy Graham -from placing the order to actual delivery only took about 25 minutes. My delivery person was very friendly and Japanese.  That's authentic...\nThe menu is basic - not much on selection but the food is pretty good. I ordered the Hunan Chicken and a side of crab rangoon. The price was a little steep for delivery though. The menu conveniently forgets to tell you there is a minimum for delivery, and the charge is $1.00 for that convenience. All told, I spend $15.00 for a meal for one person. Again, what I got was pretty good. The Hunan Chicken is mildly spicy - if you're looking for real heat look somewhere else. The crab Rangoon is a little sweet but actually very good. HUGE portion though - I think I only ate a quarter of what they sent me. The rest will get eaten tomorrow on the way back to GA. I'll order from here again, though for the price it probably won't be often.",2
review_428233,restaurant,"This place is the perfect neighborhood walk to place on a weekend. The food is amazing, they even added chicken to their menu! My one and only criticism is that the beer is warm. I would suggest on their busy nights (Fri, Sat, Sun) they get an ice chest and put their beer in that. They are serving it too fast for the fridge to keep up. Other than that, awesome!!",3

review_492730,restaurant,"Went to try this buffet after hearing a few good things about it. We arrived noticing the line wasn't so long like other buffets. We probably waited 20 mins for a table of 3. I guess the reason was because the food totally sucks!! There seemed to be a lot of experimentation and stuff that didn't work out. Wasabi mashed potatoes? Wtf? The eggs Benedict was bland, the rice in the risotto was semi crunchy, and I avoided the Asian food and sushi all together, they looked like they came from some packed food!  Food seemed to be undercooked or under flavored. I got some food that was still cold or got cold for being out too long. The wait staff was nice and friendly though. 1 star for them but 0 for the food. Avoid at all costs! Go to bacchanal M or whatever else. This is not worth $35 for brunch, gotta be crazy spending extra for mimosas for a bad experience",0

I mean, how big can a lettuce wrap be?  Turns out Jimmy John's found the jackpot of humongous lettuce leaves.  The only disappointment was the minimal amount of turkey. Everything else was incredibly fresh and tasty.  The dijon had a nice kick to it and the peppers were DELICIOUS. \n\nThe cherry on top was walking out and--gasp!--being THANKED for my business.

review_361589,restaurant,"Allow me to be an asshole for a moment while I write this terrible review. Maybe its because it was Monday, and raining.. maybe it was because I was in the mood for Humble Pie and not Mexican grill.. maybe its because restaurants in Arizona don't have the freshest sea food in the United States of America, whatever it was, I hated this place. \n\nI have this habit of asking my server what their favorite thing on the menu is.. and usually I go with it. I am adventurous, I like surprises.. So homegirl suggested the nachos or the Seared Ahi tacos.. so what do I do? I ordered a taco plate. Since I like variety, I mixed and matched and went with a fish & pork taco with black beans. The Ahi tasted wicked old and nasty fishy. I almost spit it out, but I am a lady and that is rude. The pork was very undercooked.. I don't know about you, but I have absolutely no interest in catching Trichinosis. I can think of better ways to spend my day than with nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, fatigue, fever, and abdominal discomfort.. sorry those are not things I am interested in, thanks anyway though. Beans were served cold and I swear the rice they served was something out a box from the dollar store. My dog could make better rice than that. There was shit floating in my water and the limes I asked for were so dried out that not one drop of juice came out. Seriously? Cut up some fresh ones.. its the little things that count. \n\nService was slow, but the chick was nice enough. One of the girls I went with knew one of the managers, who was supposed to hook us up with an employee discount, but conveniently forgot about us at the end.. but what are you gonna do, nothing is free anymore. \n\nI dunno, I just wasn't impressed.

review_260967,restaurant,"Had a horrible meal here last night on 9-19-11 for my Wife's birthday. It was a busy night with Jazz and fireworks at Lake Las Vegas, but the hostess was helpful and found a seat for fairly quickly. That was the end of the pros for the evening. We were greeted by a waiter after 15 to 20 minutes, ordered a glass of wine, a lemonade and a glass of water for my daughter. The wine and lemonade came out relatively quickly, 20 more minutes before we saw the water. Ordered a meal, with appetizer (Caprese), a salad and two entrees. The appetizer and salad came out at the same time, Appetizer was bland, salad was great. Then another 20 - 30 minute wait and only one of the entrees arrived. It was PENNE AL SALMONE AFFUMICATO  (Small tube pasta with smoked salmon, peas and shallots in a vodka pink sauce) - which came out more like macaroni and cheese over penne with smoked salmon mixed in.... underwhelming. My daughter ordered SPAGHETTI AL POMODORO (Spaghetti pasta, garlic, basil and tomato sauce), we will never know how it was because it never came. We all ended up sharing one entree, and despite asking the waiter several times, they just couldn't deliver. Drinks remained empty after delivered and we were never asked for another round, top off the water etc. Overall the worst service I've experienced and disappointing food. I'll not be back. The price for all this out the door (1 wine, 1 lemonade, 1 appetizer, and 1 entree) $60! Felt like I was robbed of a good  evening and half my wallet",0

They don't even have anything like Alfredo or classic Italian choices. It's all very 'fine italian' and a limited menu. The prices aren't bad though. \n\nI'll come in here for a super quick bowl of that bolognese sauce every time though. 2 minutes after ordering it lands on my table sometimes before the bread ever gets there. Service is therefore pretty good. \n\nFor desert I've tried their pancotta with pepper. That was really strong pepper. That's like a really Italian fish that I'm not sure most people will like.

review_360562,restaurant,"My fianc\u00e9 and I were in town for an event and wanted to go out for a nice dinner. Sadly, this place was a disappointment, and at least we had one another as company to make a crummy restaurant fun. \n\nI will start with the absolute worst thing about this place...... THE SERVICE!! Seriously, who is in charge of hiring here? They really need to rethink their whole staff. I would seriously equate the service of this place to that of a Pizza Hut. The waiter took zero interest in us. I asked him if the risotto was vegetarian or if it was made with chicken stock... to which he literally said \""Well, there is no meat in it and it comes with vegetables, so it is vegetarian.\"" Sorry, this does not make it vegetarian. He did not even offer to go and ask the chef like any good waiter or waitress would do. Needless to say, I did not trust him and went with the mushroom ravioli instead. Looking back, I actually wish we were the type of people who could have not tipped at all, that is how bad it was. \n\nMoving on, the food. Overall, the quality of the food was very meh. As I said, I got the mushroom ravioli, and my fianc\u00e9 got the Berkshire pork chop wrapped in pepper bacon and garlic mashed potatoes. We also ordered a side of onion rings. The onion rings were a joke. Literally, I would prefer the onion rings from Portilo's any day. I mean, I would even take Burger King onion rings over these. The ravioli was fine, definitely nothing special. This place seems to think it is way fancier than it actually is. My ravioli came out with carrots and green beans on top.... just because you make your food look \""fancy\"" does not mean it is good quality. In fact, my extra dressings were luke warm, and I had to remove them from the dish because it completely threw off the flavor. I tried the gralic mashed potatoes, and they were also fine, probably the same quality you would get a buffet. I absolutely did not feel as though the quality of the food lived up to either the descriptions on the menu, nor was it worth the prices they were charging. I think we ended up paying $50 for everything here, when in reality, it should have been much less based on the quality. \n\nThe decor is very eclectic. Definitely nothing special and it just felt like we were sitting down at a chain restaurant. \n\nNothing about this place really seems to match up. They are really trying to be something that they are not. I definitely would not recommend this place to anyone, especially if you are looking for a nice evening.",1

Kudos to Matt and Erenia for holding true to the idea of making rad, no-frills breakfast food like they do back on the farm.  I don't eat here as often as I'd like, because the lines are impossible and I don't have the time to devote to an hour wait for Saturday or Sunday breakfast, but if the night before was long and I end up sleeping in, I have no shame about grabbing some breakfast at 1:30, and the lines are usually gone by then.

So we finally received our order after 2 hours of first calling.  Totally unacceptable!  Our neighbors wanted to try this place so we dined in and gave it another shot.  We decided to eat outside since it was so nice.  The tables were disgusting, they don't clean them apparently.  We had some cheese sticks first which were not cooked enough.  My mom ordered spaghetti and meatballs which was all water on the bottom of the plate and did not taste good.  I had an Italian sub which was gross!  It had some weird after taste.  It took 2 hours to complete our experience there.  In the meantime, 2 couples walked out because it was taking so long.  The waitress smelled of alcohol.  Just a complete mess at this place!

review_128676,restaurant,"Tried this place last night. It was packed and although my friends and I enjoyed all the food overall, there were some serious service snafus. Our server was hurried and not at all on top of it. He should have had some help, as he made a couple of serious mistakes. I ordered a glass of cabernet and my partner asked for chardonnay. Almost every restaurant automatically serve the 'house' or lowest price wine when someone orders a glass of cab etc. Our server did not. He took it upon himself to substitute a glass that was 3 times the price of the house wine (the portion of wine was also very small, like 4 ounces). When the check arrived I tried to find the manager, and a hostess finally foind him outside. He was nice enough  and said he would fix the check. He reduced the  wine portion from $48 to $24, still $4 more than it should have been. Our server managed a poor apology and told me he was too busy and simply made a mistake. Hmmmm. Not buying it. Another note, get rid of the crappy, loud piped in Spanish music and add  some air conditioning,thr restaurant atmosphete made us all want to leave asap. So food 4 stars, service 2 stars.",2
review_376543,restaurant,"All you can eat for $19.99! So many good things about this place.  Nice and roomy, open 'til 3am and a big karaoke room for a big party. I'll probably need to take a several shots of soju before you can get my ass to sing anything haha. Parking is hard to find though since this is a pretty busy popular small plaza.\n\nNigiri sushi here is better than most places I'e tried. I get them all seared, but that's just my personal preference of how I like my nigiri served. So many good things on the all you can eat menu that it's so hard to recommend just a few. But here are my favorites: Soft Shelled Crabs, Sexy Roll, Baked Mussels, Scallop Roll, and Bacon/Scallop Skewer.\n\nFor desserts, Almond Mocha Ice Cream is very good but kinda of a bummer that they don't have Tempura Ice Cream.",3
review_450121,restaurant,"They take forever, and the service is terrible. It is 2 blocks from my house so I would go there out of convenience, but not anymore. The bussers are very attentive, but the servers and bar staff are garbage. \n\nExample 1- I asked for the vegan veggie sandwich with cheddar cheese and sweet potato fries. I got a sandwich with no cheese and regular fries. When I asked the server for my sweet potato fries she told me they were out. So.... You're telling me you were out of the item and didn't mention it to me or let me pick my own side?\n\nExample 2- champagne brunch. They run out of OJ after 2 glasses and have to \""go get more\"". So we ask for just a glass of champagne to hold us over, and the server tells us no its not just champagne, it's mimosas only. Are you kidding me?!?!\n\nI have many more examples, but the bottom line is if you have several hours to waste, and would like F grade service, accompanied by C grade food...this is the place to eat.",0
review_538553,restaurant,"Several people kept telling me - YOU MUST TRY Bd's Mongolian Grill!!  So when my friend had her birthday dinner there, I thought it was a great time to try it out.  Unfortunately, I just wasn't impressed.  \n\nThe party was on a Friday night and, of course it was hoppin'!  We were informed as to how the place worked, given bowls to fill, and told to have at it - Meats, Veggies, Sauces.  This is where they lost me.  \n\nThe meat... it just didn't look good.  I also didn't enjoy the idea of raw meat sitting out there for people to self-assemble.  Maybe I just worked in the food service industry too long... but eww.  Also, it just didn't look clean.\n\nThere were decent vegetables - nothing gross or moldy.  They had tofu!  Thank goodness for tofu!  If it wasn't for that, my meal would have been a disaster.\n\nFinally the sauces.  I will say, they just weren't clearly labeled clearly.  Also it was just messy.  If you don't know flavors, you won't make a successful stirfry.  There were several people at our table who destroyed their meals by incorrectly mixing sauces.\n\nThe grill is what sells the restaurant.  They guys that work the grill are efficient, comical, and friendly.  They are my reasoning for giving Bd's 3 stars.  I liked the grill.\n\nWould I return to Bd Mongolian's?  If a friend had a birthday there, yes.  If not, I probably would choose one of the other SouthSide venues for my meal.",2

review_251747,restaurant,"Just got my lunch. 3 cheese enchiladas with maybe one teaspoon of cheese total. Served luke warm with very little sauce. A huge disappointment. Had to ask for ice in my beverage and the attendant / cashier acted insulted that I wanted ice. She then proceeded to take my cup and dunk it in the ice machine to scoop some ice. This place is a disaster. Run when you see the \""open\"" sign.",0
review_488107,restaurant,"Taberna is a great spot for drinks and some decent Mexican food.   The patio is really nice,  and the d\u00e9cor is fun and resembles its menu... a modern twist on old world Mexican.  I started off with their signature margarita, it was fantastic. A bonus (which used to be standard with Mexican restaurants) is they serve you complimentary chips and salsa.   I really enjoyed the mango tomatillo salsa with the plantain chips, but the fire roasted salsa seemed to be the table favorite.  The chips are thick, but not greasy and definitely made fresh to order.  Our server was very knowledgeable and was able to provide me several vegetarian options that were not listed on the menu.  I decided to order the veggie enchilada's with a side of black beans. The beans were a little bland (not spicy as indicated on the menu), but the enchilada's were solid.  The rest of the table was not as satisfied.  No one loved their meal, and a couple peoples food came out cold, mine was not smoking hot, but definitely edible.  After a complaint was made, they promptly replaced the cool dish and the manger offered us free desserts.  For desert we had the trio of gelato and the flan.  The gelato was good; my favorite was definitely the roasted banana... Yum!  The Flan tasted more like a ricotta cheesecake.  I normally don't like flan, but this was excellent!  The meal started and ended with a bang, but what came in the middle was a little disappointing.  Despite its shortcomings, I'll definitely give Taberna another shot.",2
review_486116,restaurant,"So glad we found this place! Who doesnt love good BBQ? I mean really who doesnt?! Well we found this place the other day while driving around trying to find something for an early dinner. Inside is clean and open they even have a small dance floor and live music (not sure what days). We orderd the $20 deal with pulled pork,brisket,ribs, mac&cheese and greens with a side of sweet potatoe fries. Well they give you plenty of meat for sure but the sides are pretty small(-1 star) All the food was good creamy mac yummy greens and yummy smokey meats. Oh and the fries delish!! Customer service was great! Oh and I almost forgot the deal comes with dessert. The cobbler was soo good. A must try to cure that BBQ craving!",3
review_645617,restaurant,"I have previously been to Postinos in Gilbert and loved it. Tempe's location was also great. Probably gets extremely busy when the semester starts. I am guessing that because it was at night and during the winter break, parking was not an an issue. Might be during the school season, although there are garages near by. \n\nWe had the bruschetta for starters. I recommend all of them! I am an Arnold Palmer kind of girl and my friend loves the cucumber honey.\n\nShe had the soup of the day (cheddar and potatoes - don't remember the exact name) and thought it was pretty good. Definitely a creamy soup. We both had the chicken and mozzarella and it was delicious. I'm a cheese lover so I loved that it comes with a pretty thick slice of mozzarella. I had Hannah's Field salad and I thought it was pretty flavorful, I would definitely have it again.",3
review_167856,restaurant,"This is a must! Every time we visit Vegas this is always our  first dinner in town. The ambiance on the patio is fabulous watching the water show, and the service is pretty good. The food is always consistently delicious so make sure you save room because the fresh warm baguette and butter they give you before dinner can become very addicting.  Make sure you order a steak, it's their specialty!",4
review_172806,restaurant,"Pink Taco is one of my favorites because the menus are pink and sparkly and the waitresses never mind when I come in with my hot pink Pink Taco shot glass, and of course being loud and obnoxious doing tequila shots is just so much fun. The food is pretty good for out of California Mexican food....I like the chicken tostada salad, it would be better if it was steak...but, we can't have everything we want...\nThey freshly make their tortillas, which I guess is pretty standard now, but still a plus in my mind. \nThe one really unique thing is the tequila pina colada....it was pretty good, and if you are doing tequila shots, being able to order a frozen drinks without mixing rum and tequila is amazing.",2
review_134573,restaurant,"This place is awesome. The ambience, the food, the service was all really great. Barely waited to get seated. \n\nWe got the prix fixe as part of a Groupon. Would definitely recommend and think it's worth the normal price as well. Everything we had was pretty good, especially the meat dishes. The only thing I didnt think was THAT great was the soup. \n\nI was a bit upset that we didnt get the mint tea in the end, but other than that, I would definitely come again.",3

review_484421,restaurant,"I had high hopes for this place considering there was a relation to my favorite place to get a burger (Penguin) but what I found was sub par food and long waiting times (For a Saturday night) My family and I waited for about 40 minutes in a cramped area to get seated. Because we had a child and needed to seat her at the end of the booth due to limited seating, we were seated in the back area near the old garage doors, where there was a draft. We all kept our puffy winter coats on as we ate our dinner. \nWe ordered fried pickles and burgers. The staff was attentive and kind, very on top of things so at the very least they deserve props for that, howeverThe food was not that good, way too greasy (It messed my stomach up and thats hard to do) the burgers tasted a bit off and the fried pickels were insanly greasy. The places wasn't really enjoyable enough for me to return.\n\nThe one other positve thing I can say is that they had a great beer selection, something for everyone.",1
review_531922,restaurant,"I've been a Wahoo's regular for years. I used to go to the one in West LA at least once a week. About 10 years ago, they opened a location on the strip in the Hawaiian marketplace. Unfortunately, it went bust after only a few months. Luckily, there's a new Wahoo's in town and now I can get my Wahoo's fix. My go-to meal is the Maui bowl - marinated steak with seasoned rice and beans. This particular Wahoo's has gotten it right (tender steak, slightly rare) and gotten it all wrong (beef jerky on rice, anyone?). Your mileage may vary.\n\nThere's a special late night menu at the bar, along with a discount if you're in the hospitality industry. Hey, it sure as hell beats Del Taco at 3 am.",3

review_390867,restaurant,"I have been going to this location for awhile and either this place has went downhill or my expectations are way higher. Let me first say it is a Sunday night so it is really dead, of course. The salad bar is just boring, you get an iceberg mix, wilted spinach, a pre-made soggy caesar, and a small bagged mixed greens. There are all the normal veggies, celery, peppers, carrots, you know. The soups were atrocious looking, I tried the lentil veggie and it tasted like a cleaner, blech! I had a baked potato which wasnot completely cooked right with some margarine and sour cream that looks like it was sitting out too long. The breads were hard and bland. Everything was just meh. The state of the place is pretty bad. The carpet is stained and ripped. The booth seats are all ripped, mine was so messed up that i was sitting about shoulder height to the table, the same height as my kids on the other side. The tables were not bussed promptly, Ours wasnt bussed the whole time we were there and I hate sitting with my old buffet dishes while eating my new one. The waitress and another cook went outside to smoke and everyone was looking around for them. A guy was spraying the sneeze guard with cleaner, that can't be good, the spray most likey got on the food, hence the cleaner tasting soup. It was just an uncomfortable experience, I felt ill after leaving.",0

Quality of Food is greater than the Price.... it's just science.\n\nNam Sao is very authentic. Gives Discounts to Students.

review_550254,restaurant,"Awesome restaurant, nice vibe to the place. Waiters kind of hover around you which is annoying, but the food makes up for it. Get a steak, since it is a steakhouse. Also the toffee pudding desert at the end of your meal is a must have...no matter how full you are!",3
review_645879,restaurant,This location has excellent staff and the food is exceptional. I am allergic to dairy and they can accommodate that for me which is very difficult to do normally when going out to eat. They are quick and make it easy to get food during lunch time. The restaurant is very clean and quiet so it's a nice place to sit and talk or catch up with a friend. The smoothies are delicious and I get the chicken pesto flatbread without the dairy products and it is phenomenal. I definitely recommend that everyone come here and try this place especially if you have a dairy allergy and can't get anything at those other smoothie places.,4

review_168923,restaurant,"It was good, but it didn't meet my Yelp great expectations.  It was also not really worth the loooooong walk out there.  I read someone's review saying it was just past the Wynn, but it is WAY past the Wynn, for anyone who's walking.  In fact, it's right before the Riviera, which is pretty far down.\n\nThat being said, the food was decent.  Between 3 of us, we ordered the Maserati omelet, waffle combo, and Munch's breakfast (a special).  All were pretty good, but a bit overpriced in my opinion.  Portions were huge.  The service was ok, a bit lackluster.  Our waitress was nice enough though.  I guess I'd come here if I was close but if you're not staying at the Riviera, I wouldn't make an extra trip to come here.",2

When I called from a friend's phone and told him I didn't have my phone but that I was a previous customer and gave him my number, he said he would just drop the pizza at my house and charge my credit card if I didn't show up.

The bread not nearly crisp enough. It was kind of a small portion as well; something I would make while babysitting- not restaurant quality. My mashed potatoes - while I think real were not even hot! I likened them to nursing home mashers...yikes, My bf's chili was just ok as he put it . \n\nOverall for 2 small grilled cheese w/small sides and 2 waters it came out to $16. These were not $8 meals ...just saying. \n\nI guess I expect diner food to be more plentiful - better priced- and just all around greasy goodness.

review_569616,restaurant,"They teach you that when you're about to give bad news, you should start with something positive, right?  Here's the good...\n\nThe chips and salsa were really good.  The chips were extra salty and I was happy they arrived that way rather than me pouring on salt like I'm waiting for a heart attack.  The margarita was delicious and at happy hour prices, it's a steal.  The queso and sopas were tasty as well.  The bread pudding was also yummy.\n\nAnd the bad...  \n\nThings were not terribly well seasoned and there were no salt shakers on the tables. Perhaps it's an oversight but tables with no salt shakers are a sign of arrogance.  This is acceptable at places with gourmet food...at your neighborhood Mexican joint?  Not so much.  \n\nWhere things really fell down for me was the service.  There seem to be general chaos where the servers were concerned.  Our waiter, although he was very, very nice, seemed extremely distracted.  I noticed other tables (all in the bar section) experiencing poor service as well.  Food went to the wrong table.  The wrong check went to the wrong table.  We waited an inexcusably long time for more tortilla chips and my husband had to ask for them twice.  Our drinks sat empty for a very long time.  We even pushed our empty glasses to the edge of the table to indicate that we were not finished medicating ourselves.  Everything took far longer than it should have.  \n\nThe other thing that bothered me were inconsistencies between what was on the menu/what our waiter described and what came out.  The menu stated the bread pudding came with rum raisin ice cream (yes, please!).  It arrived with vanilla bean ice cream.  The waiter stated that it came with a blueberry sauce but it arrived with what was clearly a raspberry sauce.  It was still a tasty dessert but I like things to arrive as advertised.    \n\nI think this place has potential but they have some work to do.",1

review_319969,restaurant,"Finally: an upscale(ish) restaurant that has LEGIT pho!!!\n\nMy sister and I stumbled upon Mainland while wandering around the new section of the Palazzo shops.  It is basically a noodle house with other Asian type dishes on the menu as well.   The decor is very sleek and modern-clean lines and long bench seating.  We went on a Friday afternoon and it was close to empty-I think there was one other couple eating in there along with us.  There was an army of employees ready and eager to serve us-almost too many, I'd say...it was a little nerve wrecking having them stand around and stare at us while we ate.\n\nOnce I saw that they had beef Pho on the menu I was sold.  I really wanted to see if an upscale place could to Pho right.  And, I'd say that they really did.  It was surprisingly good...I was impressed and pleased.  I almost want to say that I liked it better than the ghetto hole in the wall place I go to get Pho in San Francisco called Vietnam, because at Mainland we got quality cuts of meat.  At Vietnam, I sometimes I cant even tell if it actually is beef and not rubber bands that are floating around in my bowl of soup.  Mainland's pho was true to what pho should taste like, and the ingredients were top quality and the establishment is clean and trustworthy- not what I'm used to when eating pho.  \n\nI should mention that my sister hated the soup she ordered at first-some sort of grilled chicken soup that she thought was going to be chicken pho but ended up having charbroiled chicken and corn in it...we sent it back and she got the soup I ordered and was enjoying.\n\nAll in all-I cant wait to come back and bring my pho connoisseur boyfriend and best friend show them that good pho can be done in a nice restaurant.  Also, I'm eager to try some of the other Asian-style appetizers on the menu that looked tasty as well!",3
review_531119,restaurant,This place serves mediocre food at best at an expensive price.  Refried beans are watery looks like they basically too a can of pinto beans and poured them on the plate.

Orders don't make it back to the kitchen or get lost (these are actual things we've been told). It doesn't matter if the restaurant is slammed or if there is only a few customers, the service is the same. We took friends from out of town to Sushi Creek a few weeks ago. There were 4 of us. We waited over an hour for our food and only 3 of us received our plates. Excuse after excuse and 25 minutes later our friend finally got his dinner. The manager did take his meal off and gave a 15% discount. Such a ashamed that had to happen.\n\nOur family went again today. Only about 4 or 5 tables occupied in the restaurant around 3:30pm. Once again our order didn't make it to the kitchen. Appetizers came out with meals. Half of my daughters food was dumped on the table and the waitress acted like nothing happened; half her meal wasted. No sense in complaining to management about the service. It doesn't seem a priority. This place could really be great if their staff got their act together. If you want really good food and are extremely patient, go to Sushi Creek.",1

review_464540,restaurant,"The pizza is well above average and the only wood fired pie (or unique in any way) in the area. The crust is phenomenal and the Italian ham that we had was not the routine variety...extremely tasty. The only reason that I don't rate this place higher is the lettuce. All of the salads from the house to the bed that the caprese rests on is shredded. Shredded! Enough with the sub topping, get some real lettuce in there!",2
review_105502,restaurant,"Meh. That's what I've got for this one.\n\nWhy the hell is there a 2 hour wait for this place? It's not bad, but it's certainly not amazing. They have tiny menu -- pizza, calzones, a app salad, and antipasto. That's it. Period. Done.  \n\nSo therefore, their customer service and food should be out of this world. They're not.\n\nI got there \""early\"" for Scottsdale, and was given a buzzer and a 30-45 minute wait, so I sat down out front to wait for the rest of my party.  My friends arrived. And we waited and waited. I went to check at 35 minutes, and we were next on the list.  Finally, at an hour, I went back inside to check. \""Oh, we buzzed you twice, you didn't answer.\"" Um, no. I purposely didn't wander somewhere more comfy and away for douchey guys with their collars popped so that I could be near the door. And if someone doesn't answer their buzzer, how about stepping the 2 feet out the door and calling their name, so maybe at the least, you could get your pizza shaped buzzer back.\n\nIt didn't really get better from there. We finally got sat. It took forever to order, and longer to get our food. Not to mention that all three of our glasses (sprite, iced tea and water) stood empty for literally 25 minutes (I timed it). Calzones came and they were ok, but certainly nothing to write home about.  From being seated to getting out of there, it was about 1 hour, 45 minutes. That's how slow the service was.\n\nI'm giving 3 stars, because I have since heard that their pizza is their thing, and I'm willing to wait and see on that.",2
review_394636,restaurant,"Great place for late night munchies and a beer! First Food & Bar is open very late and located close to the upstairs entrance. Very dark lighting that makes for a really laid back vibe. I ordered the chicken mcfingers with waffles and a fried egg. Sooo good! The waffles were crispy and the batter had to have cinnamon and other good spices. The maple syrup doused over the chicken and waffles was real, not artificial. The host and server were very friendly despite having to serve us at 2AM. Great beers on tap and mixed drinks. Overall, great late night joint on the strip!",3

review_535745,restaurant,"this place is really not good at all, probably one of the worst all you can eat sushi restaurants that I have been to. Really not worth the price for what you are getting, not to mention that they don't even include any type of dessert on the menu or even green tea. Way too many extra charges and small bland portions.\n\nI won't be returning",0

review_530569,restaurant,"This place was pretty darn good. Its a cash only and the menu is pretty simple, burgers, dogs and fries. The burger reminded me of a backyard bbq and was pretty darn good. My boyfriend had the triple and a dog (he's got a large appetite) and couldn't quite finish it all.... but don't be mistaken, you will get spankings if you don't finish your food  !! The decor is pretty corny but it was a great time.  If your down with the grease and love a little entertainment Vegas style... this place is for you!",3
review_204308,restaurant,"I usually only use Yelp to find places to eat. But my experience at Carraba's was terrible that I had to make a Yelp account to write a bad review. I don't and wouldn't recommend this place. If I can give no stars, I would. Came here for dinner with my family last week. It was our first time coming here and it will definitely be our last. The service was slow and very inattentive. When we were ordering our food, our server didn't tell us that pasta doesn't come with non-pasta dishes, only sides like mashed potatoes or spinach. When we received our food we were all surprised to see how small our \""regular\"" entr\u00e9es were. For the price we were paying we thought our food would be a lot bigger portions. The food was mediocre and cold, like it's been sitting at the window for awhile. Overall for the price it's worth it's definitely not worth paying. I even spoke to a manager regarding my concerns about our dinner and he didn't really seem to care. We won't be coming back here anyway, I'd rather go to Olive Garden!",0
review_43480,restaurant,"Now I've never been to Chicago and I've never had the deep dish, so I'm probably not the best person to be writing this review, but I'm still going to put in my thoughts! Not bad, but not good, either. What really ruined it for me was the cheese. It was just, rubbery. I don't think any kind of pizza should have rubbery cheese. That's a huge no-no for me. The crust was good, though. I liked the balance of softness and crispy.",1
review_158496,restaurant,"In town for homecoming weekend - Go Badgers! - our group had to try Mickie's.  We went on a Friday morning and the 6 of us waited maybe 5 minutes and were able to grab a big table, a big deal since it's seat yourself.  \n\nThe service was a little slow, but it's an old fashioned breakfast place, so it was expected.  As a vegetarian and health nut, I was so very happy to see whole grain pancakes on the menu board.  They were.....different.  Kind of like bread, thick, and huge.  I liked them though.  The boys of course tackled the Scrambler.....and didn't eat until 8pm that night because they were so stuffed.  \n\nOverall, a cheap breakfast place near campus which us visitors enjoyed for it's individuality.",2
review_266093,restaurant,"I was at Lake Las Vegas last night with my wife and we looked around at the other restaurants but nothing struck our fancy so we decided to give Auld Dubliner another chance.  We walked in and were told it was seat yourself.  We sat down and waited, and waited, and waited.  We were there for 10-15 minutes and no one even spoke to us.  The best part was that two different waiters were serving two different tables on either side of us.  They definitely saw us, saw we had no menus or drinks, and still did nothing.  I was willing to give this place another chance because the food was good the first time and just the service was bad.  I guess the bad service is their standard and I will never go back here again.",0

review_143264,restaurant,"awful service. awful awful awful. \n1) for our party of 9, the waiter went around and poured everyone wine but forgot to pour me. i had to be  like \""could i get some white wine?\"" before he came back and realized his mistake.\n2) my friend and i split a beet salad, and he tried to serve us the beet salad on our bread plates that still had half eaten bread and crumbs all over it. she had to be like, \""could we get two clean plates?\"" for him to go through all that extra effort of getting us clean plates. wtf?!?\n3) on our last bottle of wine, he split it among just 5 of the 9 guests.\n4) i hate it when waiters try to upsell on the wine, especially when they make it blatantly obvious. \n\nand beyond my hang up with our shitty waiter, the food wasn't that great either. beet salad seemed pretty amateur. pappardelle was decent, i will give it that much credit. but clearly they are using the wolfgang puck brand to gouge customers.",0
review_145350,restaurant,"Why hello there giant, delicious burger.  Hello indeed. \n\nYeah, that's me flirtin' with a burger.  You would too if you were at Ichabod's.  I got a teriyaki burger there that was as big as my head (do you have ANY idea how huge that noggin is?) and much, much tastier, with fries and a soda for something like $8 all together.\n\nTotally an awesome lunchtime activity if you're in the vicinity.  It was completely populated with older people, save us, and that was adorable.  They have a salad bar that I would be reticent to try, but for those who don't want to just hear \""OMG MEATY BURGER\"" there is that option.  And if the salad bar does completely suck you won't have to go far to drink your sorrows away.\n\nOddly enough, I've lived down the street from here for over a year and I've yet to visit the bar.  I'll have to remedy that the next time I want a giant tasty burger.  Really, they're good.",3
review_468532,restaurant,"Buffet spoil alert....Republic's Buffet is the best in town!!!!  \n\nEvery Saturday and Sunday they offer a buffet menu that is amazing.  For those looking to strap-on a feedback at the local casino, you may want to try something different for a change.  You order from the menu and each meal is hand crafted for you, brought to your table and served with a smile.  Try the eggs benedict over a toasted english muffin covered with hollandais sauce and lobster...and then plan on ordering it over and over and over again.  The NY Strip filet is ample and cut thick...just a way a steak is supposed to be cut.\n\nThe All You Can Eat buffet is $16 and for an additional $15 you can have bottomless Mimosas or Bloody Marys.  As a former Chicago native where new restaurants popup every week, the guys at Republic figured it out.  Thank you for bringing this restaurant  to Vegas...I wish you all the best of success!  \n\nThere are VERY few restaurants in Vegas that come close to the quality, atmosphere and professional staff of Republic.",4

Buffet overload of many food selections.\n\nI love this place because it's tapa style so you can try a bit of everything without wasting food that you couldn't finished!  I love the presentation of the food too.  It's beautifully-styled and arranged.  They got a bit of everything, however, I must say, the Asian food section was OK.  Not a lot of sushi selection and asian food.\n\nMy favorites:\n*Angry mac n cheese\n*Cheese platters\n*Roasted chicken\n*Dessert sections!\n\nDon't forget the dessert section.  I felt like I was in a desert heaven! Bite-sized  ice cream, gelatos, chocolates, strawberry dipped in chocolates, small bakery desserts...yum o yum o...that section was my weakness.  I must have had sugar overload and went straight into food coma afterwards...but, totally worth my $ and pallet.\n\nEnjoy!  =)",3

I used to rank the burgers as best in town but now we can't stomach it.  Foods cold or undercooked as has been for past year. It's a great state atmosphere but we can't cheer much if we are throwing up outside. Seriously, please please please please please please just fix the food.  Serve a limited menu on gameday no one wants a salad.  Just focus on a small number of items and do them well.  We just went to another bar and the owner came out and asked what we liked and how he can improve.  Do that.  Take a poll.  Get it back to how it was years ago please.  This review will be 5 stars if you do.",2

review_639679,restaurant,"I came back the 2nd time craving for some shrimps and I didn't get any!!! Horrible horrible service. I ordered one pound shrimp along with crawfishes. The crawfishes came out but not the shrimps. Our server seem to be avoiding eye contacts. I told her the shrimp never came, she said they back up in the kitchen, alright then. Then I notice they bring out shrimps for this couple that show up after us. I asked three servers and they all said they'll check on it, yet avoiding my eyes when am waiting for them to come back. We done with our crawfishes and still no shrimps!! The check came out and I told the girl I still have not get my shrimp, she can cancel it, her response was \""ill see what I can do\"". Came back and says that she was able to remove it from the check, well shit! Of course  am not paying for something I didn't get! As if it was trouble to ask her to not charge me. One more things, they decide to pull out a bin of trashes and instead of going thru the front door, they made my friend get off from her seat so they can pull the bin across, how rude!!!",1
review_406722,restaurant,"Uhm I don't know why I come here.\n\nI think it's because I'm yearning for my Filipino childhood. I usually hit this place up when I'm desperate for Filipino spaghetti.

I know, it's weird.\n\nbut the spaghetti is usually runny or watery with their sauce. The chicken? It's aight. I'd come back here only for the spaghetti.

review_76954,restaurant,"We ordered take-out from this place and the only plus was that it came pretty quickly. Other qualities of the food included being too salty and too much sauce.

review_538288,restaurant,Found this place to be very expensive for the amount food that we got. We order a rack of beef ribs it was &24.99 and it was 4 half ribs.  We also ordered the meal that said 2 to 4 people for $35.00 and was 2 small sides and 4 small biscuits and all the meat was in one styrofoam tray and didn't even come close to feeding 4 people.

review_513807,restaurant,"Earlier today (Friday Aug. 12, 2011) I attended Genghis Grill for lunch.  I was able to find the establishment with no troubles, and parking was bountiful. \n\nWhen my date and I walked in, we were given a tin bowl and were escorted directly to an open booth.  Our drink order was taken seconds later and we were told we could go up and begin to create our custom stir-fry bowls.\n\nI must say, I did not understand or believe people that said you can get any meat you want, and as much of it as you want.  Well, this is 100% true.  To the side of the restaurant, there is an open serving area with the labels: \""Proteins\"", \""Seasonings\"", \""Veggies\"" \""Sauces\"" and you pick your \""Starch\"" at the grill.  \n\nWhen the food arrived a few minutes later, I was more than pleased with my unique and one-of-a-kind creation.  Initially, I was worried about how my sauces would mesh together - I went with the mongolian bbq, 3G, and dragon sauces.  But it turned out to be the perfect combination of sweet and heat.  \n\nOverall, I was extremely pleased my Genghis Grill lunch experience.  It was extremely filling and as very well priced - around $22 for two people  (I have taken a picture of my bill). \n\n**BEWARE**  - As others have stated, beware of mixing different sauces.  Be sure you know what your getting.  -You are allowed TWO starches if you prefer.  I recommend the tortilla and brown rice.  -If you live anywhere in north Charlotte, it can be over a 25min drive. -This place has a ton of options to choose from.  To be  prepared, my date and I went on the Genghis website where you can use their interactive menu to draft your meal before you go. This place can be hectic during prime eating hours. My date went here a time prior, and felt rushed by other patrons behind her. Therefore on this trip we planned our meal ahead online and went during non-peak hours.",3

review_623389,restaurant,"I was a big fan of the old Pomo having gone there with family a couple of years ago.  Yes, the intimate feel is gone but the service and the food is still top notch. \n\nThey brought that mural of Sicily from the old place over to this new location. We were with two family members so we started with a couple appetizers,  the Caprese and something I have never had before, the Crocchete Pugliesi (potato croquettes filled with Fior di Latte and prosciutto). Both were excellent and reasonably priced. \n\nThen on to our personal pizzas.  I had the Principe (prosciutto, arugula and shaved parmigiano reggiano). The wife had the Peppino ( ricotta cheese, hot calabrese salami). On the advice of a family member we tried the pizza with a drizzle of their hot pepper flake olive oil.  OMG. I will be doing that from now on. The pizzas were as good as I remembered from the old place and made a great midnight snack straight out of the refrigerator.  :)\n\nI really liked the take out and market place on the left as you walk in.  From what I am told it is a very popular lunchtime option which they didn't have at the old Pomo.",4

review_830,restaurant,"Sharia don't like it, and neither does Becky. \n\nBoy and I went to Casbah on a warm Tuesday evening. The restaurant wasn't busy, and we were seated in the inviting outdoor patio. Our waitress was very pleasant and extremely informative about both the drink and food menus. \n\nWe shared a bottle of Mission la Caminade (Malbec, French). This was a very good, medium-bodied wine. \n\nMany yelpers have raved about Casbah's bread and pesto. I don't get it. I've had much better sourdough elsewhere and the pesto wasn't anything to write home about. \n\nI had the asparagus soup with crab for an appetizer.  The soup was served cold and tasted fresh enough, but something was off, and I barely ate half of it. \n\nI ordered the orecchiette pasta as an entree, which was served with grilled chicken and cranberries in a goat cheese cream sauce. I am upset to report that this tasted rather bland. The cranberries were the only spark of flavor in the dish.  Boy ordered the ricotta cavatelli pasta, which was in a marinara sauce with sausage and ricotta. I am sad to report that this too was tasteless. The ricotta was dumped on top and added nothing to the dish. \n\nWe glanced at the dessert menu, after spending so much on food we didn't enjoy, boy and I decided to cross the street for ice cream, instead. \n\nOverall, Casbah has a nice atmosphere and service, but their food quality doesn't match the price tag.",1
review_74653,restaurant,"The food was just OK.  The decor and view from our window table were excellent, but the upscale, or romantic atmosphere we expected was mixed in with a TV over the bar near our table, airing sports, and a too loud piano player in the adjoining lounge (where the TV should have been, if there at all).  Our waitress was excellent, and knew the menu inside out.  The bus boy, on the other hand was overly intrusive, and rolled his eyes when we requested a fresh glass of water, as he had poured sparkling water (Pelligrino) into the plain water glass of one of our party.  Perhaps a language barrier.  Wish I had known about the 1/2 price specials listed in the other reviews. Had our bill been 50% less, there would be more stars as price to quality is important, when considering the entire experience.  At an average of $60 per person, including the tax and tip, and with only 1 beer and 1 glass of wine on our bill, I felt the food, itself should have been much better, and the atmosphere less like a sports bar with loud music.  A positive note is that, at the end of our meal, a man came to our table and introduced himself as the manager.  He asked if we had enjoyed our experience. We were polite, but not shy to tell him our thoughts.  He's only been the manager there for a short time, but not only listened to our coments, but asked questions, so he could make improvements for future guests.  I found him sincere.  He didn't give us any sort of discount, or other consideration, but that's not why we complained, anyway.",1

review_35984,restaurant,"As a lover of Italian food and an even bigger lover of not leaving my house, I decided to give this place a try! As a first impression, I think it went pretty well, and I'm looking forward to my next experience with this place. I ordered the Lasagna and an order of mozzarella sticks. My review:\n\nMenu/Ease of Ordering: 5/5 Used GrubHub and everything went pretty well. They have a pretty large variety of options here also, which is always appreciated.\n\nDelivery: 4/5 I ordered at around 7:40PM and I had an estimated time of 8:40-8:50, which is pretty standard for a delivery place. I received my order at around 8:30PM, so a little ahead of schedule. The food was nice and warm still, which is sometimes hard to do with pasta dishes. The lasagna came in a nice foil container, helping retain the heat, the stix in the standard styrofoam container. My only complaint was that some of the sauce from the lasagna leaked out onto the plastic bag and then the styrofoam from the sticks and the napkins they included. Mildly annoying, but forgivable. \n\nLasagna: 4/5 Pretty decent lasagna. I've had better, I've had worse. This lasagna has quite the variety of meats: sausage, beef meatballs, and ham. I've never had ham in lasagna before, but I honestly couldn't taste it in particular in this dish. I'm not a fan of sausage, and it was quite flavorful here. Which, if you're a fan of, I'm sure you'd love. The meatballs tasted nice. Quite cheesy with a decent amount of extra sauce. I don't know if I'd order this again, but it quelled my craving for lasagna.\n\nMozzarella Sticks: 3/5 Eh, these were just okay. They gave you an ample amount of them, but they just weren't all that great. 7 or 8 sticks and some marinara. They clearly tasted frozen and didn't have too much flavor to them. I will not order these again. \n\nAll in all, a pretty decent experience.",3
review_215091,restaurant,"I went here with a fellow Yelper who had a fabulous coupon from restaurant.com.  At 11:30 AM, it was one of few places that was willing to serve both breakfast and lunch.\n\nI ordered the club sandwich and side salad, she ordered the french toast, and we shared the hummus/crab pate appetizer.  We asked for everything to be brought out at once because we were in a bit of a hurry, and it was all served at the same time.  My side salad was yummy, with all of the non-lettuce accompaniments chopped into tiny little cubes.  The sandwich was on bread about the thickness of a pita and made panini-style.  I loved it: turkey, ham and bacon makes everything better.  \n\nThe appetizer was a good one to share, but I definitely wouldn't want it all for myself.  I enjoyed the roasted red pepper hummus and my partner in crime enjoyed the crab dip.  We both enjoyed the sliced veggies and grilled pita for dipping.  It was on a huge serving platter sized plate though, and I felt bad leaving so much food behind.\n\nThe service was good, the patio was wonderful and the food was yummy.  My only complaint is the bit o' 'tude we got from the waiter when we told him we were using the coupon, at the beginning of the meal.  He said it was only good for dinner, even though it didn't say so, then did us a \""favor\"" by honoring it.  Mildly annoying, but nothing that would prevent me from returning.",2

review_50269,restaurant,"My husband and I recently stayed at the Buttes and were looking forward to a great dinner at Top of the Rock.  What a disappointment!  We dined on a Sunday night when the restaurant was almost completely empty (there were only 7 couples the entire night, including us) and were seated far away from the window and any chance of a view.  Perhaps an empty restaurant left the staff feeling less than excited about work, as service was mediocre at best.  My husband ordered the beef short ribs, which was a fairly decent dish.  Unfortunately, I ordered the pork tenderloin.  The pork was so salty that I couldn't even finish it, and the overpowering garlic in the accompanying side of creamed barley ensured it remained mostly untouched on my dish.  We left without a single goodbye, feeling as unappreciated upon exit as we did upon arrival.  If you're looking for a nice dinner, save your money and go to Kai or Ko'Sin at the Sheraton Wild Horse Pass Hotel!",1
review_538755,restaurant,"I will first start off this review by saying if you haven't been here before, you need to visit this place!  My girlfriend and I headed here before the Pirates game this past Tuesday after I found some high ratings for it here on Yelp.  The outside of the restaurant makes it look like the inside of the establishment would be your average neighborhood bar.  That couldn't be further from the truth though as the inside modern chic and they have a really awesome speakeasy downstairs.  There was also upbeat jazz music in the background the whole time we were there and they have live music on the weekends.\n \nMy girlfriend and I decided to start off our meal with the veggie fries that came with a trio of dipping sauces.  We weren't really sure what to expect from them but whenever they came we saw that we had chosen wisely.  In addition to your normal zucchini fries, there was also portobello and green and red bell pepper fries.  The breading was perfect as it helped to enhance the flavor of the vegetable but was thin enough to let you taste the vegetable as well.  All three dipping sauces (a tomato relish, white cheddar something? and a bacon ranch) were also good with the bacon ranch being my favorite.  For my entree I ordered the Buttermilk Chicken which was a fried buttermilk battered chicken breast with white cheddar grits and collard greens.  The first thing that I noticed whenever my dish came was how large the chicken breast was and that it had a great golden brown color to it.  I was actually impressed with how moist the chicken inside it was but was slightly disappointed in the lack of seasoning in the batter.  This was easily remedied though as I asked for some hot sauce and while waiting for it to come tried some of my grits on top of it.  Both did the trick and I ended up thoroughly enjoying alternating between the two.  The grits by themselves were awesome as they were easily some of the cheesiest grits that I have ever had before.  Finally the collard greens were cooked nicely and had no bitterness to them at all.  When all was said and done it was easily one of the best meals that I have had in the burgh lately.  The server that we had, Jarrett, was also awesome and one of the best that I have had recently.  He was polite and engaging while easily answering all of the questions that we had for him which really helped to enhance our experience here.\n \nThe bottom line for me is that I will definitely be back here in the future.  I am actually excited to head back here for not only the food, but to have cocktails on a weekend night and listen to some jazz music.  This is definitely a hidden gem on the North Side!",4

That's how much I love Palatte!\n\nFrom the hospitality (one of the owners met us at the door and graciously pointed out the menu and ordering procedure) to the food, everything was spot on! Finding it neither pricy nor pretentious, even my husband, who was very skeptical of going on yet another Yelp inspired dining adventure, was also impressed!\n\nArriving at 11ish on a Saturday morning, the crowd was lively and not too large, which made my husband very happy, as he hates to wait. After reviewing the very inspired and delectable menu, we got in line to place our order (short line, nice people!). The young lady who assisted us at the counter was absolutely delightful and after a few quick questions, we decided on the Lemon Crme French Toast, bacon, Tahitian vanilla yogurt, Melted Tomato Tarte, Iced Tea and Lemonade.\n\nWe paid for our order and wandered out on to the expansive and inviting patio to find our place in the sun, and to my husbands delight (he hates the sun!) there was a lovely table for two on the patio with a great view of the courtyard and a pleasant distance from the guitarist who was unobtrusively entertaining the guests. We took our seats and continued to enjoy the morning.\n\nFirst to arrive were our beverages, which were both good, but unremarkable. After a few moments, our server appeared with our entrees. My husband really enjoyed his French Toast (coconut, lemon curd and blackberries.... yummy!) and remarked that although this was the first time he had ever had French toast without syrup, it was very, very good on it's own (with the lemon curd, of course) and didn't need any syrup. His bacon, like the beverages, was also unremarkable (we were hoping for something like they serve at Matt's) but it was tasty and not overcooked (a pet peeve of mine).\n\nMy Melted Tomato Tarte was so darling, it was almost too cute to eat! The crust was light and flaky and the egg and bits that comprised the tarte were heavenly, although a few bites struck a sour note when what tasted like Dijon mustard had been mistakenly baked into the tarte. But since the rest of the tarte was awesome, and only two small bites struck that odd note, I let it pass without comment. The Tahitian vanilla yogurt was very creamy and flavorful, but had way too many sliced apples on top for my liking (a French thing, maybe?)\n\nEarlier, while waiting for our breakfast, I wandered back into the little shop that is part of the interior of the home and met a delightful young lady who was wrapping up little packets of silverware and napkins with bits of string. She was expecting and was actually past due, trying to pass the time while awaiting the arrival of her little girl, Ruby. I wished her many blessings and went back to join my husband at our table and enjoy the lovely surroundings.\n\nThe guitarist was a very pleasant surprise as well. Although he looked a bit like a folky Joey Ramone, his sound and range were simply amazing! He really added to the ambiance and we found ourselves staying longer than we had planned because he was really that good! Armed with nothing more than his guitar, mic and small amp, his catalogue included smashingly good renditions of Harry Connick's Don't Get Around Much Anymore, John Mayer's Waiting for the World to Change and my favorite, the Gilberto, Jobim and Getz version of The Girl from Ipanema.... wow, that made my whole weekend!\n\nLater, as I decided to use the WC to wash my hands before we enjoyed the rest of the day, I ran in to the same young lady who took our order and mentioned how much we enjoyed our morning at Palatte and how darling everything (including the bathrooms) were and she told me that the whole place was conceived, designed and brought to life by the owner, Christine, who was trained in France and had a passion for what she did. She offered to introduce me to Christine, who she said, was just outside passing the time until her baby arrived. I told her that we had already met (even though I didn't know she was the owner at the time) and would be sure to let her know how much we enjoyed our morning. By the time we were done chatting, Christine was gone, so perhaps she was off to meet Ruby for the first time...which will give us yet another reason to go back to Palatte! Palatte was just such a pleasant surprise from the food and the servers to the atmosphere and the entertainment; I still just want to move in!! Even the toilet paper was soft!! I so heart this place and will be back again soon. Christine and Ed have done an excellent job in making their dream a reality and have created a little slice of  rustic French countryside for us to enjoy right here. They got every detail right and I will continue to call Palatte home (at least on Saturday Mornings!)",4
review_581484,restaurant,Good food as always however Togo experiences was not good. I had asked for ketchup packets the girl told me she put some inside but there were none. \n\nDining in experience were great our server remembers everything and offers lids for my sauces along with my to go box.\n\nThe food does take a while though both take out and dine in but I guess that applies to all the B dubs that I've been to.

review_379643,restaurant,"We have had breakfast to go a few times here. Nothing special! Eggs, bacon, breakfast burrito, hash browns. Food was good, nothing to write home about. Just Yelp it!!

review_602590,restaurant,"First time experience and it was good. I was highly impressed with there choices at the salad bar. So many choices and it was all very good. The meat choices were all good on an average. Some I didn't care for and some were good. The only choice that stood out for me was the garlic sirloin, which is odd for the cut of meat and what I usually prefer. This is my first experience at a Brazilian steakhouse so I have no comparisons, but the meat quality was average to good nothing special. I definitely will be bringing others back here every once in a while.\n\nThe only negative thing I can really say is the whole red/green card thing was a joke. They didn't follow that one bit and started asking us for meat as soon as we sat down eating our salads. it seemed like they ignored that and just brought us whatever meat based of the table next to us and what they were eating. It made it a little hard to enjoy when they showed up with 4 cuts of meat at once and nothing for 5  minutes. They could of done a better job a timing and spacing it out. It was like all or nothing it seemed. Overall that wouldn't prevent me from coming back.",3

review_234175,restaurant,"I think the sad sad day has finally arrived when gorging myself to the point of bursting is no longer appealing.  There was a time when my Vegas experience wasn't complete without rolling myself out of a buffet, but I've grown wiser (and thinner).\n\nI came here twice over the weekend while staying at Red Rock - once for dinner and once for brunch. Both were $16.99 after the $2 player's club discount and we also had coupons for 1 free buffet and 2 for 1. So for the 3 of us, it ended up only costing $6/person. That's cheaper than McDonalds! You should check the local paper because there are always coupons. \n\nIt was slightly disconcerting that the food at dinner and brunch was mostly the same, but it's not often that I have the opportunity to eat prime rib for breakfast. There are tons of choices from Italian to Asian, Barbeque, Sushi and \""International\"" (which appears to be mostly Mexican). The prime rib is very good, but some of the other foods were a little dried out. The tortillas were like cardboard and the biscuits shattered into a million crumbs when I tried to split one. I also liked the mashed potatoes and tapioca pudding - I know, I know, I can't help it, I love cheap carbs. \n\nService was very good and our plates were always cleared quickly and drinks were refilled. I'll probably come back if I stay at Red Rock again, but I might be steering clear of buffets for a little while.",2
review_220270,restaurant,"The food was good. The service sucked! Our server 'Ceasar' was super nice when he first came to the table. However after our entrees were delivered, that was the last time we saw him. I have never, ever....ever been somewhere that let's a beer glass go completely empty. Let alone a glass of tea, which both happened. The busser actually filled my husband's tea, and another server came and offered us boxes. Then I was finally offered a 2nd beer after I was about 97% done with my meal.\nIt is a shame, because the menu was inventive. We would have tried other items, like we were going to order dessert, but due to the neglect we will not be returning.",1

review_325312,restaurant,"Usually when I travel on business I choose to seat at the bar to have dinner. It is less awkward than occupying a table by myself. I've had great service here at the bar, the staff knows their drinks and have always been on point when recommending vegetarian options from the menu. \nNot sure if it is the fact that Phoenix is not as expensive as my other business stops around the country, I found the prices I've paid here very reasonable for the amount of food and drinks consumed.\nPlenty of vegetarian options, wonderfully creative drinks, attentive staff and reasonable prices. What's not to like.\nWhenever you find yourself in Phoenix, whether on business or otherwise, stop here to nourish yourself. You will not leave disappointed.",3
review_494873,restaurant,"After a weekend high rollin at the Cosmo, the wife and I wanted to get a quick bite before heading back to reality.  I saw this joint and the 20.12 special for lunch.  We were tired of the usual breakfast fare so we thought we would try something different.  \nGlad we did.\n\nThis restaurant has a very cool, modern feel to it.  High end looking but not snobby.  We each got the lunch special.  For appetizer I got the grilled octopus.  Gotta pay an extra $10 but well worth it.  Nice char to it and a surprisingly good portion with olive oil and seasonings.  The wife got the greek plate which consisted of a hummus, a tzatziki (did I spell that right?), and some kind of bell pepper spread with like 3 pieces of pita.  The wife loved it but again why only 3 pieces of pita?\n\nFor main course, I got the Lavraki which is a sea bass.  Nice and light with olive oil and lemon.  Just 3 bites in, the wife was eyeing my plate.  So we did the ol switcheroo.  That means I ended up eating her tuna burger.  While not a big fan of tuna burgers this one was actually pretty good.  Its not a seared tuna, its fully cooked but surprisingly not dry.  \n\nFor dessert, the wife got a yogurtini and I got the walnut cake.  The yogurtini was more like a yogurt parfait.  The walnut cake was nice and moist.\n\nI think that you cannot go wrong with the lunch special.  Since we sat near the kitchen I saw the lamb chops and lobster pasta going out and they both looked pretty tasty.  Next time, we may try the dinner menu.  Thumbs up from me.",3

review_576241,restaurant,"NEVER GOING BACK.\n\nWhen I made reservations for a group of 9 people, I was told that we would not be able to order a la carte and the staff recommended a family style menu at 70$ a head, not including alcohol or tip.  Once we got to the restaurant, waiter told us that group menus were 55$ a person. Already off to a bad start.\n\nIf I can resume my experience in 3 statements:\n\n-HORRIBLE SERVICE: We were seated at 8:00 pm and only got our first entree around 9:00 pm. We actually waited 30 minutes between each service and the minute I complained about it the food started to magically appear out of the kitchen at a quicker pace. My opinion was that the waiter was trying to get us to spend more money on wine by slowing down the service. Thumbs down.\n\n-HORRIBLE AMBIANCE: Music was way too loud, temperature was insanely hot it was a sauna in there. A restaurant that small, packed with that many people and with that kind of ''reputation'' should be able to afford decent air conditioning for clients. I was literally drenched in sweat by the time our main course arrived. Not a pleasant dining experience to say the least.\n\n-AVERAGE FOOD: Food was ok but nothing to brag home about, and whoever gave this restaurant anything higher than a 3 star rating must be a tourist. Oh, and get this: the wine list only has CANADIAN WINES. And they're not cheap either. \n\nMy cousin was visiting from Italy and we wanted to show him a good time on his first night in Montreal, and instead his and my whole family's experience at Maison Publique RUINED our evening. We were so glad to get the bill and get the hell out.\n\nVery disappointed and will go out of my way to tell people how horrible this restaurant is.",0
review_113940,restaurant,"Food is acceptable, service is terrible. \n\nI have eaten at this restaurant three times; twice for lunch and once for dinner.  Each time I have visited this restaurant, the service leaves something to be desired such as...... decent service. It takes 3-10 minutes to be acknowledged by the hostess once you are at the restaurant, time to be seated (even when there are only a few patrons), and even longer to be acknowledged by any one to take a beverage order.  The staff makes you feel as if they are doing YOU a favor by even talking to you/taking your order and the general ambiance is bland.  Once I called to ask if a reservation was needed, the hostess said no and hung up on me.   When we arrived we requested to sit outside and we were informed that the tables were all reserved / taken for the night.  During the whole night and the two hours it took to eat, the patio was less than half full.  For the most part, the staff is unprofessional, took time chit chatting instead of helping people and seemed immature.  The waitresses were the only ones that worked and polite, but the kitchen and overall service is very slow.  I do not recommend this place for lunch if you have any time constraints.  The last time I visited, the two parties on my right and left each had issues with either the service or the billing and the manager had to speak with them. \n\nThe food, overall, is decent and some items are over priced.  One member of our party ordered ravioli which was $20; the issue was that the plate had a total of 5 medium sized raviolis and they were still hungry after an appetizer and dinner course (that's $4 for each piece of a medium sized no-frills ravioli!!).  The appetizer of basic bruschetta for two is $12 and fries are $8.  I had the beef burger twice; once it was very dry and the second time it was good.  I would probably be fine with the prices, if the service was not so bad.\n\nOne note.... The menu varies from day to day so you may want to check their web site prior to going to make sure they are serving what you like on that day.  However, don't always expect to have their daily offered selections available.  I went once with my mother at 5pm and she tried to order a chicken dinner.  The waitress stated they had ran out of chicken! At 5pm!  The restaurant was not even that busy and that was one of their 6 main courses offered that day.  \n\nI will not be going back here a 4th time.  If you are planning on going to Mill Ave in Tempe to eat....   there are a lot more restaurants available that offer better food, prices, and service than Cafe Boa.",0
review_486230,restaurant,"Made reservations weeks ago, showed up for dinner and they said we didn't confirm!

review_421072,restaurant,"First time here with my baby for a date night dinner. The server was really nice and the services is really good. I wasn't really happy with the steak, I'm sure the chef can do better than what I can cook at home. I ask for medium rare. And the steak come out bloody rare with no flavor at all. I was really disappointed with the steak. I normally go to Mon abi gabi at Paris. And the steak have soo much flavor and cook the way I wanted. Lucky my gf order some lobster, so I ate the steak with lobster at the same time so I won't give up on the steak so fast. But then I find a hair on the lobster. That just Kill dinner. I work 10 hours today. Didn't eat anything all day. I'm saving my belly for this dinner. Wasn't really happy about it. So the manager come over and he did his job well. He said he won't charge us for the mistake they make. But what make me write this review because I was so piss when I saw the bills. I feel like I'm being rib off. He did take off the lobster part but then he charged steak witch I had 2 bite and I don't want to eat it anymore after I saw the hair. I own a business my self. When the customer is not happy about my services ? I won't charge them and even offer them to come back with a free services. This is the right way to run a business FYI. I pay $150+ for my dinner. I end up cooking instant noodles at home because I didn't get to enjoy my steak dinner :(",0

review_573983,restaurant,Terrible. Unless you enjoy sub par service ! \nThis is the 3rd time here and still a bust. It is not busy.

Will I get it here? No not unless you want to ask the waitress that pulled the wedgie out of her but then proceeded to serve others. Avoid this stop.,0

review_227263,restaurant,"What a fantastic restaurant, especially during Restaurant Week! The food overall was really good and at a very good value on Restaurant Week prices. The outdoor patio is cute and there was a live jazz band when we visited on a Saturday evening. I had:\n\n- Vegetarian Tostadas: Yum! The guacamole and chipotle aioli was quite delicious and nicely balanced the sweet cabbage\n- 12 Vegetable Enchiladas: Amazing! These have to be the best vegetarian enchiladas I've ever had - real vegetables with a lot of flavor instead of just cheese.\n- Bread Pudding: This was the only average food item we had all night. I just didn't love the combination of fruit and chocolate and cinnamon - personal flavor preference.\n- Jalapeno Creamed Corn: Oh my gosh delicious. Sweet & hot at the same time - I highly recommend this side dish.\n- Chipotle Cheddar Mashed Potatoes: Also really great - full of flavor and very satisfying.\n\nThe service we received while at Fuego Bistro was excellent. Our server was great and provided prompt service without being intrusive. She was also very observant - I ordered a vegetarian appetizer & entree, and had selected vegetarian-sounding sides that actually were not. She asked if I was vegetarian and let me know that the sides I had selected actually contained bacon. Now that's great service!",4

review_478118,restaurant,"Otto wasn't on my Vegas food-genda but was a delicious surprise!\n\nOn our last day in Vegas, we found ourselves hungry and tired in the Venetian at lunchtime.  I didn't have the energy to trek back towards Bouchon so we scanned the Otto menu and were sold.  \n\nWe were seated in the very back corner of the indoor patio.  I was a bit concerned that we might be forgotten but our service was very friendly and attentive throughout the meal.   \n\nThe meat and cheese selections were alluring but for our last day in Vegas, we went for broke and ordered a couple of the fritti selections.  The Arancini and Calzone were both delish.  The saffron risotto of the arancini was so perfectly flavored, my guy declared them the best he's had.  The calzone was very yummy and very rich.  I was surprised not to see some tomato sauce to cut some of the creamy fattiness but didn't mind a bit.\n\nFor main courses, we continued to indulge and went the pizza route:  Pancetta and Goat Cheese for me and Artichoke and Prosciutto Cotto for manfriend.  We both enjoyed the crisp, cracker crust.  Good amount of toppings.  The goat cheese on my pizza had perfect tang and creaminess.  Mine was good but I reeeeally liked the artichoke pizza.  Delicious cheese and prosciutto, great subtle lemon flavor.  Very nom.\n\nVegas is pricey but Otto's items were only a couple dollars more than a comparable place in the Bay Area where we're from.  No sticker shock here but I can imagine other blanching at paying $20 for an individual pizza.  That said, they were a generous size and very filling.  You definitely get your money's worth.\n\nThanks, Mario!",3
review_2999,restaurant,"The other reviews are spot on about the ambiance.  It's very frat house chic, with lots of crappy fourth hand furniture, flickering fluorescent lights and turkish news playing on the the big screen TV (WTF?) \n\nIt is a bitch to find, especially at night, so pack your gps.  Once you find the building, you have to punch in the code ( It was 0002 when I went) for the door to get into the lobby at least at night.  Once you're in the lobby, you have to go to the elevator and hit \""M\""  for mezzanine level.  There was no sign telling us to do that and the elevator wouldn't let us select any other floor without a security badge, so it took us a little while to figure out.  Once we stepped off the elevator, my friend was having serious second thoughts about the place because of the sketchy vibe, but I'm glad we stayed because the food was REALLY REALLY good.  \n\nI got a meat lovers pizza that was absolutely piled with pepperoni, sausage, ham,  and bacon.  It was really tasty.  My friend got the Lamb Shish Kabob which had some sort of magical spices on it.  It was like a circus in your mouth.  It also came with some kind of flat bread with sesame seeds which was really good.  \n\nThe location (second floor, over the river and through the woods)  and the atmosphere absolutely suck, but the food definitely didn't disappoint. I knocked off 1 star for sketchiness, but the place redeemed itself when our order came out.  If this place found a  little nicer location on street level, it would own.",3

If you have had a long day and you'd like to unwind with a nice cold drink, this is the place to be. A very nice place where there isn't insanely loud music and you can actually talk. It also doubles as a great place to hang out prior to movies.\n\nOn to the food, I LOVE their fries... So big and crispy and it comes in a pot... My friends are a fan of its fruit ciders.

review_438832,drinks,"I go into Boba City cafe for a quick bite while i run my errands, i order a large avocado smoothie with boba and a vietnamese chicken sandwich. First off the pricing posted on the wall for this smoothie did not reflect the actual price which was taped to the 1 register. i end up psying $6 or $7 for a large smoothie which was waaaayy overpriced. It tasted like the avocados that had been used were over ripe. In a word putrid!! When i go and pay I had some bill and like 70 cents change which the cashier helped herself to as a tip instead of giving it me. This should have been the first inclination of trouble. The sandwich was ok, fresh. I take my food and siy in my car, then decide to go back in to ask if I could get another drink instead. The cashier then said I had to pay for another. Obviously if I'm asking for a new drink this must be disgusting. Overall the service was very poor and unprofessional and it seems to me that they are  trying to make up for the lack of customers by helping themselves to your change one customer at at a time. My advice is to got to Chinatown for better prices, tastier food, and faster service.\n\nDON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!!!",0
review_509383,drinks,"Best ice cream I've ever had...hands down. Their sherbet and shakes are also bomb. There isn't much more to say about this place other than the fact that it is a must-try place in Phoenix. The staff is friendly and the atmosphere is homey. Theres also a back patio where you can enjoy your treats. Located right by Federal Pizza, Postinos, and Windsor, it's easy to skip dessert at the restaurant and try this place for a change.\n\nOverall, if you love ice cream GO TO CHURN.",4
review_112579,drinks,"I had a good time at the depot cantina. It is a fun atmosphere and is a great place to grab some brews and food. I had some sampler platter which was extremely tasty! I like their tortilla chips and their salsa is pretty good. $2 Dos Equis all day every day and I am a fan of the dos. FYI, If you go here during a tempe event you can park but you have to pay $20 to do so, then they give you a ticket that you give to the waiter to get your $20 back. If you want some tasty mex food and alcohol this is probably the best spot to go in the tempe/mill area. Lot's of people watching and places to sit. I love the big margarita glasses and you get a discount on the tasty margs if you buy one and bring it back with you on your next visit.",2

review_638907,drinks,"I came here on a Tuesday night for Techno Taco Tuesdays. Their complimentary chips and salsa were good. Their salsa is not spicy. It's the slushy, mild kind. Their tacos were $2 that night. Their tacos normally are $3-$4 each. I already had an early dinner so only got two tacos- beef adobada and the veggie potato cheese taco. The tacos are small.\n\nThey have a very impressive craft beer selection. However, they need to know their beers. My husband ordered an IPA and one of the Belgian beers for the second round. The second beer tasted exactly like the first beer. When we asked the waiter, he said it was the right order. Uh, OK? My friend ordered an amber ale but they gave him one of the IPAs.\n\nI came here again the following week. The second time here, they forgot my friend's taco. No biggie, it happens. I got the carne asada and the veggie taco since I liked that one the last time. Carne asada was OK. Not bad or the best.\n\nI would come back during HH and please make sure you give people the right beer please!",2

The staff was attentive, even if they did manage to mess up the separate checks a little. With $2.75 Killians on special and $1.50 green beer, getting charged for an extra one wasn't a problem. The mixed drinks were mixed pretty strong. Our waiter did manage to split the appetizers for each of us, which was cool.\n\nWings. The house special. They -only- have 33 different flavors, from the bbq to the virgin all the way up to Braveheart. When they say hot, they mean hot. Mix and match, Tuesday is buy 1 get 1 free night.

review_230145,drinks,"Red Room Saloon is one of those places that you just don't really know about. It's funny because I knew it was a flair bar, but I've been too busy to go. My friends work there and I was just in shock when I went to open bar. Red Room is a small little bar with some tables and seats...recognized from Target. It's got gaming and 1 circle bar. It's funny because I saw some old friends. Erin who actually taught me to flair. There's Mike from Kahunaville. Toby Ellis, one of the best bartenders in the world. Then Mike showed me to a booth and found out he owned the place. Now Red Room has lots of potential. It was an open bar event hosted by spyonvegas.com and Skyy Vodka. Knowing who was serving drinks I knew it would be good. Definitely a fun place. The dj was cool. Not your typical top 40. Come on he made Neil Diamond cool. Definitely a lil off kilter, local bar.

Atmosphere of the place is on the hip, rocker side. Some attractive guests and hostesses. \n\nThe selection of tequila and speciality drinks are really good. If you wanna try a particular tequila, this is a good place to try ones you may not of heard of. My particular favs would be Tequila Corralejo and Casa Noble. The Mi Casa margarita on the rocks is a great starter. \n\nMy main food order is usually the tacos. Either the carne asada, carnitas or the fish.

So if you like gelato- it rocks, if you like espresso and feel a little \"" hip \"" go there and have a nice espresso or espresso drink. Another tip ? okay glad you asked- It should take about 10 seconds for the sprinkled sugar to break through the crema on top of the espresso ( that brownish head on top) if it doesn't - It's not the best it can be. \nYes I make them at home that well.",4

Great new deck with mini fire pits, lots of seating, and nice wide screen TV's inside AND out!  I think it just might be one of the better places to hang outside on a pretty day around Charlotte or when you're interested in catching a sporting event out and about!  Not a bad seat in the house that I could tell for TV access!  How's the food?  We had the Fried Goat Cheese Salad, which was a bit bland for my liking, but the Fish and Chips were scrumptious!  And there were a lot of other items that I look forward to checking out soon.  After eating we moved inside for trivia night (which we proceeded to win by the way!).

A group of us on a Sunday bike ride (the pedal kind) had a pit stop there and for some reason they have happy hour every day of the week - except Sundays.  Spring training season was over so the place was barely a quarter full on a lazy afternoon.  It's a nice place, but 3 domestic beers + tax/tip cost $18.   I'd expect to pay that at a club at night, but it's not a place I'd stop by again during the day for a casual bev with friends.

The first time, the bar was empty so I sat by a table and it took a good while before I got a menu, or was asked what I wanted.  It also took awhile to just get a beer.  I ordered a simple meal and one beer and still didn't get to leave for over an hour!  I had to go to the bartender b/c the waiter was nowhere to be found and the manager had to cash me out.  I came back later that day, and literally stood in a packed bar for over 1 1/2 hours.  After being told by the hostess that a waitress is serving the area, I never once was offered a beer or anything to drink.  The waitress in the area just ignored me.  Their service is the worst i've ever seen in my entire life.  Blue 32 in Hermosa is much better.  I will never go to this bar again nor will I endorse it for anyone.  It's the worst bar in scottsdale as far as I'm concerned.",0

I had several glasses of the Sauv Blanc which was light, crisp, and fresh - the ideal beverage for the warm evening we had!  It went well with the food I tasted as well... I tried the petite lobster corn dogs (how can you not order those?!); the handcut pomme frites dusted with indian curry and murray river saltl short rib, seared scallops with yellow curry foam and mango caviar; roasted baby artichokes with brown butter and fifty-year-old spanish sherry; and wild mushrooms with cognac and chervil.  My bf had all of those as well as the cheese plate.  We enjoyed everything we had, even though the servings were pretty small.

However, despite its proximity to the sleaze of this area it manages to retain an air of civility and is generally a nice place to drink. The bar is very beautiful (wooden and old fashioned) and stocks a wide choice of whisky and real ales. This pub's speciality is rum though, and if you fancy trying one from their large selection ask the bar man's advice and he'll point you in the right direction. The prices here are not particularly cheap, but this manages to keep the students over the road in The Chanter (every cloud has a silver lining...). If you're looking for a nice traditional pub to drop into after a show at the Lyceum or Usher Hall, the Blue Blazer is perfectly located.",3

I WANTED the shepherds pie but again given that we didn't want to eat too much we ordered the onion rings and the Beer Cheese dip.  \n\nImpulsively I ordered a Guinness and it was not until later that I realized that this place knows the difference between a Black and Tan (Guinness and Bass) and a Half and Half (Guinness and Harp) knowing the difference makes all of the difference in the world to an Irish Pub Snob like me.  \n\nThe onion rings were VERY good and I believe made with their Bloody Mayr mix.\n\nThe Beer Cheese dip... lets just say... that was fantastic!  served with a verity of breads and what appeared to be a bit of a Parmesan crust on top of the dip, it was heavenly.  And here's the thing... I really don't like chess all that much, this was something my wife ordered.  \n\nDespite being in a Las Vegas Casino the place had a warm and cozy feeling to it and inspired talk of opening up our own pub when we retire.",3

Just the idea of textured balls in my drink made me a bit creeped out but I was strong and fought through my gagging to visit Fresh Cup.\n\nUpon entering fresh cup Joey M. and I realized we were definitely the only non-Asian customers but we weren't treated any differently which is  fairly refreshing when you dine on Spring Mountain.\n\nThe list of smoothies is long and there are so many intriguingly delicious from Kiwi to Lychee to Taro. They also have all the basic flavors so you don't have to get too crazy if you're trying it for the first time(HONEYDEW=THE NUTS). After trying a boba smoothie that first time I was back at least 3-4 times within 2 weeks to try new flavors.\n\nFresh Cup also has a sweet rewards program which gives you free smoothies every once in a while and as a Jew I can't hate on free stuff. YAY FREE STUFF!",4
review_65737,drinks,"Honey dew slush is my favorite boba drink so far, hate their milk tea, many great desserts and teas . Their crunchy pork w/rice is decent . Customer service is a little slow and not as helpful but it doesn't bother me anymore . Cute little hang out place for little kids .",2
review_65803,drinks,"I've been wanting to hit this place up for AGES, but as we pass by after eating ramen, my male always says, \""No, you already tea, you don't need more,\"" and steers me away to the car. \nOut and about with one my girlies, and we finally stopped here for a drink. \nHoly Crapballs, this place was expensive! I mean, almost 6 bucks for a small iced green tea boba? It's just a bit much. \nThe positives: huge menu of every kind of tea I can think of, and at least a hundred more that I can't. Polite enough service, and the tea was REALLY good. \nDefinitely not a good place for a nice cheap treat though.",2

review_626605,drinks,"So this is different!!!\n\nLooking for an after dinner dessert places on yelp, I came across this little place. I had never had this type of desert drinks before.\n\nI grabbed the number 6 off the menu and not knowing what I ordered I felt like I was ordering into the food order unknown! My unknown drink came out in a boba/soda like cup with a straw and spoon. I made the mistake of jumping in with the straw first and was unable to drink anything with the amount of jelly and other assorted stuff! Make sure to stir!\n\nThe menu has quite an extensive array of drinks and desserts which I think run up to about 50 or 60 things!\n\nThe decor is a cross between lounge and cafe!! Also it's Nice and clean as well.\n\nMy drink was good, I'm not gonna lie is was ok. I saw quite a few Java drinks that looked pretty sexy and next time I'll grab one...\n\nI think this a hit or miss kinda joint! You'll like or love it",2

We usually go to our regular locals bar Club Car which has the best bartender in the world Regina but she is not there on Fridays, so we thought we would go to Michaels Pub. \n\nWe had a blast! \nThis place is awesome as awesome as a local dive bar can get lol \n\nWe each ordered a long island and were impressed how strong they were and ordered a second we were buzzin a lil just off of those two drinks..and trust me we are not light weights so they do make some pretty great drinks. \n\nThen we met a group of guys that are regulars and they bought us these shots of chocolate cake, now I am so not a fan of fruity or sweet drinks but because of how strong the great bartender made the shots I enjoyed them. \n\nThis is a locals bar so don't expect any thrills but the locals and regulars that come here are very friendly and the bar tenders are pretty awesome! \n\nI will definitely be returning here!",3

They didn't do much to change the interior sinec it was REV coffee, kept most of the TI's that were already in place.  Coffee was okay, not bad per se, but just typical convenience type coffee. It was very hot when served (too hot).   Compared it with the Dunkin Donuts decaf that we later got, DD was of course better.   Out of their 2 donuts, one was too \""fried\"".

Ample seating, open 24 hrs a day, decent coffee and good soup, these make for a good alternative work environment.\n\nThey have tons of sweets, yet I don't think a single one of them is vegan so no good there. The bread you get along with your soup is animal friendly though :). The staff is all quite nice and they do well in the unique layout of the shop. Tons of space inside and out.\n\nTheir coffee is not the greatest but it's decent and I wish they had more options for us picky animal lovers, but it's still a rather nice place.",3

Bathrooms here are kind of dirty, the doors don't lock, and it's hardly clean. \nAgain, it's a dive bar. Don't expect much from this place. Bring good company and you'll have a good time.",2
review_346458,drinks,"Hello hotel bar! But I do have to say, it's better than some hotel bars I have had the pleasure to visit in the not so distant past.  I have found in my recent travels that bartenders at hotel bars are really friendly, and District's did not disappoint tonight. All three that waited on us were extremely friendly and helpful. I also appreciated that if you valet, you can get your parking validated and get up to three hours for free. The valet was very quick and the gentlemen that helped me tonight were also very friendly...dare I say the friendliest valets I have encountered in the Valley even! There was live music tonight, but at times it was a bit too loud. However, any guy with a guitar that plays a ton of songs I like is OK in my book...plus I thought he was pretty good.\n\nWe sat at the bar tonight which was very enjoyable. The bottle of sauvignon blanc was crisp and quite delicious, especially after a long week of work. We ordered the Chesapeake Bay crab cakes and the chips and dip. Normally I do not like crab cakes that are crispy on the outside, but the coating was light and didn't detract from the crabmeat. While there was not as much crabmeat as I would have liked, what was in there was tasty and there was almost no filler! Woo hoo! I can't say they are identical to what you would find back in Maryland, they are not far off enough where I can hate on them. The chips and dip were a nice snack...in fact, I almost gasped when I saw how large the serving was of chips! The dill dip was really tasty and a nice compliment to the chips. For the bottle of wine, the crabcakes and the chips and dip, our bill came to $45.\n\nI'm wavering between 3 and 4 stars, but will round down to 3 since there was nothing incredibly special or memorable about my experience. While the District menu does not have me running back, I can see this being a place to meet friends after work for drinks and appetizers or as a place where my coworkers and I run to for lunch when we need a drink or two to make it through the rest of the day!",2

The owners actually recognized me and knew my name on my first visit! \n\nWith a focus on local beers (NC/SC), there is plenty of space at the marble bar and lots of sofas and large tables to enjoy your drafts. Speaking of, they have a lot of taps going with a nice variety. Lots of local and Belgian beers (the genres I gravitate towards...I think they opened just for me). They are getting some cool stuff in, too, like a recent small-batch collaboration between NoDa and Mother Earth. Talk about awesome!\n\nThen there is the retail area, with shelf after shelf of delicious bottled suds, again with a local focus. The staff are incredibly knowledgeable and just as friendly, and will gladly talk beer and point out a few for you to try.\n\nNeedless to say, I'm a bit of a fan.

review_349831,drinks,"If you are looking for a taste of the rich life without actually being rich, then consider hitting Sushi Roku at The W hotel between 5pm and 6:30pm Monday through Saturday.\n\nThis place is great for a date or a place to kick it with friends. You are at The W, so you have the upscale feeling of being posh, and because the prices are so good during happy hour, you can actually have the satisfaction of saying \""I'll have one of everything on the menu\"" which is exactly what I did!\n\nAtmosphere: Sushi Roku is a quintessential modern Asian establishment. While it is chic, it is oddly authentically Asian. It feels open yet intimate at the same time.\n\nMy favorites from the menu:\n\nSushi Roku Fusion ($4 a glass, $18 a pitcher). As you walk past the bar you will notice a gigantic glass jug filled with fruit and vodka. This is the Fusion, and it is deliciously addicting, yet sneakily strong.\n\nMy favorite sake, nigori sake (cold, unfiltered sake which in in my opinion has a lot more flavor and is smoother) and also hot sake for just $4.\n\nMiso Eggplant ($5). I have never EVER desired eggplant or ordered it at a restaurant, but after trying this dish, at least once a week I find myself salivating over the thought of the Miso Eggplant. This appetizer is a big reason I keep coming back.\n\nSaut\u00e9ed Chinese Green Beans ($3). Crunchy and flavorful, these beans are the beans knees! I don't fancy myself a vegetarian, but I have never been so delighted eating a plate of straight veggies.\n\nTuna Tartar ($6). If you like raw tuna and avocado, this dish will melt your taste buds. Don't let the ugly name fool you. This is a beautiful dish with a beautiful taste.\n\nOysters ($2.5 each). These oysters have more flavor that most any other oyster I've swallowed. They have a garnish of Asian citrus flavors which subtly mask the true oceanic taste of the oyster, so if you are looking for the traditional unadulterated oysters, these may not be the ones for you.\n\nOn a side note, kudos to the staff. The servers, bartenders, and managers, are extremely accommodating, helpful, and very friendly. They all genuinely wanted us to have a great experience, which we did.\n\nAfter your meal, take the time to meander upstairs and see the outside dining area which edges the famous W pool, the social epicenter of the who's who's and hooha's of Scottsdale.",3

The place was empty save for a party of three at the end of the bar. I ordered a Basil Rye while the BF ordered a Canuck. Both cocktails were okay, but nothing spectacular. Most disappointing to me was that these cocktails were rather tiny, yet still managed to lack alcohol!\n\nI decided on the gravlax to start and the beet salad was my main dish while my BF ordered a Scotch egg and his main was bangers and mash.\n\nThe gravlax was good, but my oh my was this a small portion! I guess I understand but honestly, at $13, 4 thin slices of salmon was pretty disappointing. \n\nMy main was a disaster. Okay. Beet salad has NEVER disappointed me before, but this, this was an error in judgement on all levels from presentation to flavour. The beets are in a bowl... like a small diner soup bowl. They are topped with a mix of the base cuts of romaine, with the thick white vein begin the majority of the 'meat', topped still with the palest celery leaves I have ever seen. Crumbled with goat cheese and a ranch vinaigrette. Impossible to eat without everything toppling out of the bowl and onto the bar. But then again, it didn't taste very good, so who cares. With more than half the main left in the bowl, the waiter didn't even blink to ask if it was okay. \n\nThe BF got one Scotch egg for $14. It was good, he liked it. I wasn't a fan. But hey, that's me. His main, the bangers and mash must have been good because I didn't get a bite of it! \n\nWe gave the sticky toffee pudding a go too. Blah. That's not sticky toffee pudding. That is cake with the ingredients for sticky toffee pudding added to some extent to the mix, but that doesn't make it sticky toffee pudding, it makes it sticky toffee pudding flavoured cake. \n\nIf you haven't guessed it yet, I was sorely disappointed by my experience. The food was mediocre at best, and the service was sparse, inattentive and unhelpful. I won't be returning.",1

After you fill your bowl to your liking with frozen yogurt, you can add on a variety of delightful toppings, including Cap'n Crunch, red beans, crumbled candy bars (like Kit Kat and Butterfinger), or pretty sprinkles.

We said we would rather just run up a tab and buy shots, mixed drinks, etc etc.  (there was 8 of us and we would have easily ran up more money than a bottle in the same time frame of drinking a bottle).  \n\nTHE SERVER TOLD US TO GET OFF THE TABLE SINCE WE ARE NOT BUYING ANOTHER BOTTLE....  This has never happened at Revolver, Smashbox, Firehouse, Axis, or American Junkie.. We said we would be running up an equal amount, she said the only way she would allow us to stay is if each of us racked up a $200 tab. \n\n\nCliffs:\nServer was constanting pouring extra drinks and leaving them around our table.\nServer booted us from table for not buying another bottle even though we were willing to run up higher $$ tab.",0

It all just lacked a bit of depth, bit like a window display. The place is sectioned into a room through the back with a few tables, a main pub room and a dining room. We chose to eat in the pub area which was showing a footie game on a huge screen. Reasonable bill at the end of it all. I'd probably pop in again if I was in the area and wanted a safe bet. In saying that there were a couple of other places nearby that looked worth a visit.",2

We cruised in after checking out some other Cosmopolitan spots and grabbed a seat to listen to Kisses.  Having other engagements, we couldn't stay long, but the vibe of the place was cool, the free admission was even better, and the intimate size of this bar/lounge makes for a great listening experience.\n\nI didn't sample any drinks (having just had a few from the Chandelier Bar), so I can't comment there.

I asked instead for iced coffee with two shots of espresso in it. She said sure, no problem. \n\nWhat she handed me was A CUP OF ICE with two BITTER, BITTER, BITTER shots of espresso in the bottom. (That's not me being hyperbolic. I came home and made everyone in the house try the most bitter coffee concoction I've ever come across.) Okay so then she sent me over to the bar to the hot coffee. Melted my ice and my plastic cup. Not exactly what I meant when I asked if they had iced coffee... \n\nHow much did this crud cost me?? A whooping $2.75. Oh, but wait! It's actually $3.00, an extra 25 cents for running it on my card, which she tells me AS SHE SWIPES MY CARD. I had cash on me. And I really would have preferred to be offered a choice to use it ahead of time. \n\nAlso, their seating consists mostly of a long bar against the wall opposite of the coffee counter. You wouldn't be able to camp out here with a laptop, homework, or even a book. There just isn't any room. There's a few tables, but if a group walked in you'd have a major guilt trip. \n\nAll in all, you'd go to Hava Java for a run and go coffee.

Luckily, we had help from a few promoters to get our night cracking! Leading up to Lavo you walk a small balcony over looking the dining area. Its cool how they have open sinks on the balcony leading to Lavo. The nightclub itself is small. Nothing to grand about that the place. Its plain with nice interior design. \n\nIf you catch yourself going early sometimes they have free drinks for ladies. An even added plus is when the promoters have free drink tickets and then forsure the drinks will be coming your way.  The bouncers themselves are very nice. They even help you up on the ''stage'' to dance. the dancefloor is small.. real small but I have found that it doesn't get to crowded like other nightclubs. \n\nWhat I most like about Lavo is that it is not to crowded.

There's a live band every night after 10pm - this can go either way depending on the band and whether you actually wanted to carry on a conversation with whoever you're there with as things can get a bit loud. Some nights they also play host to the random art class or book club meeting as well, which again can go either way depending on perspective. The bar staff is really nice - seven nights a week.

review_303145,drinks,"I just wrote a review on another coffee shop citing what my five star criteria are - I figure I better give an example also - this is it.\nExcellent green sourced coffee (they have CoE - cup of excellence varieties available) is roasted and prepared by skilled Baristas right there in the shop.  A variety of single origin and blend bags of beans are for sale - all with roast dates printed on the bags.  Both drip and espresso brewing methods are given the attention to detail that a coffee snob would give at home - and in the end, all the finished products have the quality, variety, and complexity of flavors that excellent coffee should have.\nMy only complaints would be;  1) They prefer to source all their beans from latin america (my guess is due to locality) - would be nice if they had some Ethiopian and Indonesian varieties as well (just some different notes), and 2) A less than a pound (I believe it's 12oz) bag of CoE beans sells for about $18 / bag (with tax) right now - pretty steep, although I calculate it's that's still only about $1 / cup at home.\nLastly, concerning ambience and service - I don't grade on these factors unless they are significant detractors - and they are definitely not at the Cartel.  However, I will say, I think the complaints about service by other yelpers are unwarranted - this is a shop that caters to coffee snobs and casual drinkers / students alike.  If they tell you that you're ordering real --fill in cup here-- and not --fill in sugared up chain drink here--, that's to try to convey what you're getting so as to not disappoint your whipped-cream loving desensitized pallette (they're doing you a favor).

You'll see all sorts of customers here - from a gaggle of early twenty-somethings to a few seasoned winos enjoying a tasty glass of Pinot Noir.  \n\nTheir menu is pretty straightforward and is filled with little bites, salads, small sandwiches and a smattering of sushi. I'm a bit of a sushi snob and I can happily say they make some great, classic rolls here! The fish has always been fresh and the rolls are pretty large. Price wise, both the wine and the eats are priced fairly and I feel like they offer quite a bit of food for the cost. \n\nI'm a big fan of the Tuscan Bean app - you get a boatload of toasted, buttered crostini with a large ramakin filled with white beans, garlic, tomatoes, olive oil, black pepper, etc. Yum. I've also tasted their cheese plates and they are typically quite generous with their three cheese choices and always provide side items like walnuts, raisins, figs, etc. \n\nLast but not least, I'm a big fan of their wine flights. They are reasonably priced and offer patrons a great trio of vino fun. I've tried a few red flights and their bubbly flight.

I'm a no-frills coffee drinker, so I've never tried any of the specialty/blended drinks. Judging by the menu they're up to a dollar cheaper than most coffee chains; a lot of other reviewers seem to love them. That being said, the coffee and espresso, while not the best I've ever had, is VERY tasty - I could probably drink it black, though I usually ask for a little bit of cream, just so it cools down quicker. The chocolate covered espresso bean that comes with every drink is a nice touch too.\n\nThe baristas are super friendly, helpful, speedy and always remember what you prefer, even if you only show up once every couple weeks (I'll admit that it doesn't hurt that all the baristas that have served me here are pretty girls with cheery personalities). My first time there, about a year ago, they explained their punch card and specials - there's a double punch day (Wednesday), you get a free drink once the card is full and I'm pretty sure they have a happy hour, I think it's from 4-6.\n\nMy only complaint is that I don't live very close to this location any more! It was really convenient on days that I didn't have time to make my own coffee at home. I wish they'd open more locations.

review_610142,drinks,"Cooling you and your loved ones down with a smoothie, shake or shaved ice in this trying triple digit heat and intentionally or unintentionally doing a good deed (for every smoothie or shake purchase you are helping to feed a local child in need via Three Square Food Bank) is simply way cool!\n\nUnless you have a custom craving that can only be met by your unique blend of flavors engineering, you can easily get very nice pre-formulated house combos in the shake and smoothies departments.  Probably save a buck too.  \n\nThe Morning After Shake is the most unconventional, with bacon, OJ and maple syrup in the concoction.  I might order it if the bacon was baked crisp and rendered of most of its otherwise flavorful bacon grease.  This will likely appeal to the \""I dare you\"" kids & kid at heart crowd.  Although everyone I know that was at the grand opening thought about getting this bacon shake, none actually went through and ordered it to pop their FGS cherry.\n\nSince Nutella basically goes well with just about any dessert, but was not featured in any of the existing House Designs Shakes, I was forced to \""architect\"" my own blend with Hershey's Cookies & Cream Chocolate Bar + Nutella, with a base of non-fat yogurt and low-fat milk.  The result was okay, but not the Nutella chocolate bliss I was hoping for.  I hypothesize that the same amount of Nutella is added to a 16 oz order as the 24 oz order, thus the larger the size the more diluted the flavor.  \n\nThe shake was also loose in consistency, not the thicker shake that requires you to channel your inner Dyson vacuum power to get it through the boba straw.  (Viscosity of the shake could also be affected by the huge turnout at the grand opening event.  Big line of customers that went out the door for 2 hours straight = less or insufficient amount of time for the frozen yogurt machine to semi-freeze the yogurt mixture before it was dispensed into blenders as orders came in).  \n\nNelson Q was also at the FGS \""grand opening\"" festivity, and ordered the Almondcado, which he said was good.

The one inside Frys and Safeway a few miles north are great.\n\nWe rarely frequent this location since it seems almost every time we go the coffee tastes burnt or stale. If I'm paying 5$ for coffee I am really expecting the best possible quality. The young kids that work here are all very friendly and seem to always be working (cleaning, stocking etc). I just want to be clear that this review is strictly product based and not employee based.\nI don't know if they aren't stocked as frequently as other Starbucks or what the deal is but they seem to be out of common orders a lot. \n\nThis location is very convenient being off the 17 and carefree highway. It's unfortunate that they will most likely never do anything to improve this location as I'm sure they get a lot of traffic from people traveling. That being said, if they made a few minor improvements I'm sure more people from the surrounding neighborhoods would visit this location instead of the other three Starbucks just a few miles north.",1

I had the Citi-zen it has rock candy, I also had a Moscow mule. Has a ton of ginger which I like, not everyone does. \n\nI got the grilled cheese and added bacon. It was good, nothing special. It tasted like mashed potatoes more than cheese but hand me truffle anything and I'll eat it.\n\nHe got the lamb burger he liked it but neither of us cared for the fries they were dry. \n\nI know they offer a more extensive dinner menu but we weren't looking to spend 30-35 on an entree I'd definitely go back but probably just for drinks and appetizers.",3

This is the worse customer service especially coming for the country club at the Wynn. I've eaten at other restaurants at the Wynn and never had this type of service before. It took us 45 minutes to get the bill correct. The waiter was slow to take our orders and never introduce himself.,0

Not impressive at all. Glass of Pinot Noir for only $4, great deal. Next, Sashimi: we tried 4 different types of fish, 3 of the 4 tasted the same, as if the fish was either previously frozen or very low grade. Also, their \""sushi chefs\"" need some more training in knife skills as the yellowtail had a couple of \""bits.\"" And the fish portions were all inconsistent with slices of all different widths and lengths and were not very cold. For the same price of a plate of sashimi, I'll stick with my benchmark: Hiro in Scottsdale with Japanese chefs and the highest quality fish.

I got even more suspicious.\n\nWhile I enjoyed my selection in this bright and spacious area, I watched the bakers below in a clean and impressive kitchen.  And, then I saw customers slowly trickle in, one by one, until there were about a 20 people in line.

Most people will tell you the best feature here is the view.  While the view is amazing, in no way do I think it is the best feature.  The best thing about this place is the atmosphere.  Relatively quiet, dark, and intimate.  This is the kind of lounge you can actually hold a conversation with the person next to you without yelling in their ear.\n\nThe next best thing, although not for me because I'm a lightweight, is the strong drinks.  So pace yourself.  Or do what I did and just girl out by getting one of those Berry Bellini drinks.  They're easier to stomach than the hard alcohol drinks.",3

It got really windy, so we asked our waitress if we could move inside. She was very helpful and got us a table right away, no attitude about closing out our bills, at all. \n\nThe setting both indoors & out is very casual.

We ordered, were served by staff able to hide efficiency with cheery chat, and took a seat, noticing the blackboard congratulating someone on their new baby.\n\nAn older lady came in, slowly making her way toward the service area.  The bearded guy behind the counter asked how she was, to just take a seat and he would come and take her order - without a hint of patronising 'customer service'.  He seemed genuinely happy to see a regular and saw it as his business to come to her for her ease and comfort. Y'know, *actual* customer service.\n\nThis care for customers and genuinely happy attitude is one of the reasons we have become huge fans of Tea Tree - Jamie and Trey (the bearded guy!) have managed to get it just right.  Good food (my husband loves the haggis panninis and the bacon sandwhiches), happy banter with customers that's never too intrusive, a light atmospere and surroundings.  Plus, they do amazing coffee and tea, even though tea is their main reason for being.  Apparently, they had the good sense to realise someone needed to do for tea what Starbucks had done for coffee.  \n\nAnd I think that that is what the friendliness hides - that these guys know what they're doing when it comes to a good brew.  They love what they do and that really comes across.  They even had this particular coffee addict drinking tea which, for the first time in my life, I liked!\n\nI'd rather support a local company than a generic franchise - so I won't be keeping Tea Tree to myself but will be recommending it (and their Honeymoon Slice) to everyone I can - it's worth making it a point to go in and try it out!",4

Okay, so maybe the decor is teetering on the edge of cheesy, but the food is definitely above standard, and the vegetarian options made it an ideal destination in my vegetarian days.\nI've honestly never had a \""bad\"" veggie burger here, the combinations they think of are seriously out of this world delicious. On $5 burger night, it is 100% worth it to head down to the southside and grab 1 or 2. I  mean they're only $5?\nBasically every night they have some sort of special - taco Tuesdays, seitan wing nights. It's exciting for a vegetarian, because rarely do veg heads get the opportunity to participate in one of the most beloved happy hour traditions in this city...half of wings. I don't eat wings, so I'm more than eager to grab them on special at OTB.\nIn the end, if you're looking for cheap veggie eats at a reasonable price, OTB is your place. I will however warn you, you will NOT be getting any sort of homemade veggie burger. These are either morningstar or Boca burgers simply grilled and topped with a couple crazy accompaniments. Rather unfortunately, on par with other reviews, the service does indeed suck. If you're not a regular, you're basically ignored until the server decides \""Well since they're not going away...\"" \nThat said, I'd still go back.

Unless you want greasy fast food then it's not a great place to go for lunch or dinner. If it's a coffee you're after, you'll get much better value for money across the street in The Grind House or even Starbucks. Likewise, if it's a live music venue you're after then there are plenty more in Edinburgh that aren't quite so cramped and chaotic.\n\nBasically, by trying to be too many things at once it ends up being neither.

review_48072,entertainment,"I've visited Angels' home away from home, also known as Tempe Diablo Stadium, a few times, most recently two weeks ago.  The ballpark certainly serves its purpose, but the facility is not nearly as nice as the other ballparks in the area.\n\nWe came here for a Dodgers/Angels game on a Monday afternoon.  The game was sold out, and all the parking spots were taken loooooong before the first pitch.  We showed up at 11:30 for a 1 pm game, and we were forced to park in a parking lot of a corporate building far, far away.  Walking back to the stadium, we had to, ahem, dodge cars and scalpers, which wasn't exactly an R&R type of activity.\n\nOnce inside the stadium, I felt much better.  Let's face it, there are worse places to be on a Monday afternoon.  We had seats just to the left of 3rd base, 5 rows up.  I was surprised that such good seats were not seats at all.  They were bleacher benches with back support.  There was hardly any legroom at all, and when someone needed to get through, it was an adventure in itself.  The concourses are also very small and crowded, so getting concessions or walking to the bathroom is no picnic, either.\n\nI like how the ballpark is designed to look like a mini Angel Stadium, complete with giant red letters \""A\"" and the view of the mountains to the left and the freeway in centerfield.  The ushers at Tempe Diablo Stadium are also among the most lenient and friendliest in all of Cactus League.  Well done!",2
review_2586,entertainment,"We are so lucky to have such an amazing theater community in Pittsburgh.  This unique theater adds so much to the mix!  It's a fantastic theater because they focus on plays, usually with one musical in the mix. There's new works here, like the original show The Chief, about what else, but Pittsburgh Steelers founding owner Art Rooney.  They bring in the classics like A Midsummer Night's Dream and The Important of Being Earnest.  They also have newer works right off Broadway, like The Rabbit Hole and Superior Donuts.  Plus, they bring in Second City every year, which is big in my book because they've spawned a couple SNL cast members!! \n\nI absolutely LOVE the theater!  I'm a big fan of a theater in the round.  That means there's seating on 3 sides of the stage.  They've also been able to do some really cool things with the stage/set, like making an actual pool for the show Metamorphoses.  My favorite all time show was The Secret Letters of Jackie and Marilyn, which was a world premiere.  The show was about a made up relationship between the two women where they wrote letters to each other.  It was a VERY cool concept! \n\nThey also do a lot of great events like the Mix at 6 for young professionals before a show.  Plus, they understand that most of us under 26 (and of course sometimes above) are broke ho's, they offer $15 tickets!  The great thing is, there's really not a bad seat in the house! \n\nAgain, we have a fantastic theater district, so TAKE ADVANTAGE and go here!  Don't make me tell you twice!!",4

The best thing about Shark Reef is the sunken ship, where you can see tons of sharks, a few sea turtles, and one huge ray. I was able to see a couple of employees dive while I was there.

The grounds are on the side of a mountain and it was too hot to walk. \n\nThe Falls pool area is large, with plot of seating/lounging, a bar/cafe, a waterslide and a huge play pool with a volleyball net strung across. \n\nThe waiter was quick with our drink orders and kept them full. The prices are a little steep but it is a resort. \n\nThe youngest had a good time in the lower falls area, sang karaoke and everything. \n\nWe had a great time and would come back again.",3
review_388378,entertainment,"Saw Divergent tonight at the Galaxy located on the Cannery property.  Three problems with today's experience:\n\n1).

RESPONSE:  \""oh yeah...we know about that.  I think we are working on a fix.\""  Me \""you may want to let folks know who are trying to purchase online\"". RESPONSE:  \"" glazed look in their eyes....\""\n\n2). Watched the movie Divergent in theater #2 and about 20% of the screen was a different color than the rest of the screen.  It was show center at the 12 o'clock perspective of the client.  Mentioned it to the two representatives at the desk.  RESPONSE:  \""oh yeah...we know about that.  We plan to get it fixed at some point.\""  Me: \""it was kind of distracting watching the movie....\"".\n\n3). I also had two Chatty Cathies next to us.

review_83149,entertainment,"Here fans can find sports bar food, done in an ordinary fashion.  Television viewing was well thought out, even if the food is not.  You can literally see a TV no matter what seat you are in. I can't say I've ever been to a sports bar with good food.  Maybe it's too much to ask to want to watch the world cup and have a decent meal.",1
review_229222,entertainment,"This casino is g-h-e-t-t-o, but the main draw of this place is for the fried Twinkies and Oreos (or as the lady helping me called it...an order of heart attack). The line moved extremely SLOW with three people behind the counter taking their sweet time - two helping with the food and 1 at the cashier. \n\nI seriously felt disgusted while waiting in line just seeing all the greasy food (not that I'm opposed to it), but it was obvious why this place was a hit with the above average weight crowd. Also, the area was filthy (the guy cleaning the tables just wiped the food onto the ground). The guy behind me and myself both had tissue stuck to our shoes at one point.\n\nAside from the ghetto casino, the nastiness of the restaurant, and the long wait, the fried twinkies and oreas were damn good!",1
review_481718,entertainment,"Loved it! The dinosaur exhibits are great. I wanted EVERY GEM in the gem room. Hey, Carnegie family, how about giving me that diamond and platinum bracelet? Even a loaner would be fine. The discovery room is comfortable and friendly, and we got to pet a stuffed (dead) bear. We saw lots of stuffed (dead) animals, the camel tableaux is shocking. It reminded me of the California Academy of Science in SF, the way it was before they remodeled and screwed it all up. If I'm back in Pittsburgh, I'd go back again. It's kid friendly, people friendly, and a beautiful museum.",4
review_180474,entertainment,"Great place!\n\nHotel-wise, they had everything you'd need and looked great!\n\nWhat I really want to talk about is there pools!!!!  We started at the lazy river one and must have went around in circles for an hour before it got a bit crowded.  Then we headed to the wave pool which is the largest and had a blast just hanging out in there before heading to the super shallow pool to the side (roughly a foot deep) and just sipped on some drinks for a while.  Such a blast!  We almost said screw the plans, lets just stay here!\n\nWasnt so crazy about the crowd  though :(  We tried to find a chair to put our stuff down on, but couldnt find even one.  So we ended up grabbing food at the beach grill place right there and it was not very good at all !  Kinda bummed us out even.  Thankfully that was before we went in the pools so the day turned around.  If you go to the pools, go early!",3
review_184213,entertainment,"I had been here once or twice before.  On those trips I didn't have a negative experience, but it wasn't a good one either.\n\nThe first thing you should know about my most recent trip (and what will be my last) is that someone got stabbed in the crowd.  This is the fault of the venue.  Security is a joke.  When entering I watched multiple go inside after the metal detector wand had beeped.  The overcrowding in the General Admission area certainly didn't help the matter.\n\nDue to the stabbing, security (and later police) roped off an area of about 15 square feet due to it being a crime scene.  This of course didn't help any of the crowding concerns.  The blood puddle was left untouched which is important for the crime scene, and we should be able to continue the show right?  Nope, after 2 or 3 more songs the concert was ended early.\n\nThe ticket prices are ridiculous at this venue ($60 after fees for general admission).  It's even worse knowing that the concert still had at least 30 more minutes.  Not only did I feel unsafe because of this venue, but they also essentially stole $20-$30 from me.\n\nEDIT: One employee has contacted me through yelp regarding this review and apologized for my bad experience.  I appreciate it.  I have also sent some letters to some managers and directors as well.  I will try to update further if anything happens.  All that said, the review will remain at 1 star as that was my experience of the venue.  It would take a lot to get me to return and re-evaluate my rating.  I would not re-evaluate without actually returning.\n\nEDIT2: House of Blues has responded to my letter and has sent me a gift card to compensate for my bad experience.  I'm very happy that they responded to my complaints.  Hopefully soon I'll have an updated review and a much better experience to share.",0

review_161571,entertainment,"I stayed there this weekend with the date and we had a really good time. I did the upgrade, and they gave us this great room with a spa tub, and everything about it was pretty clean (one of the chairs had a slightly noticeable stain on it, but that's all). The room was huge, probably larger than we should have stayed in, but it was fun.\n\nI actually enjoyed coming here with her, especially since I'm kind of tired of coming to Vegas and got to see it with someone who isn't tired of it. Paris is about the right size for one of these theme casinos -- not too large, not too small -- so it's easy to walk around and conveniently located across the street from the Bellagio and their water show for the turistas.\n\nSome of the restaurant choices are kind of weird (outside of the Eiffel Tower restaurant, which really isn't French, there isn't a French restaurant here), but for the most part it's a fun place. \n\nThe coolest part is some of the random music acts they have off the casino -- very classy and elegant for a place that doesn't always have a classy and elegant crowd.",3

Easy decision there. Got to the Wynn and found out that the event was being hosted by none other than Mr. Olympia himself, Mr. Phil Heath! Cover was $75 to wait in line, or $100 to skip the line. I didnt feel like waiting in line, fuck it. Get inside and theres gratuitous amounts of T & A rubbing up on you because its packed like a sardine can! the DJ was on stage pumping up the crowd, beats liberating the women dancing on tables, strip pole platforms, dancefloor, and even in the pool. The line for the bar was forever and a day...if you were a bitch about it...and prices were typical Las Vegas ridiculousness. made it from the indoor part of the club to the outdoor part between Wynn and Encore where there was a little more room to move around, dance, and mingle with the other clubbers. Didnt get smashed drunk like some people there, not baller enough like that, but thoroughly enjoyed my night with a lot of beautiful people in an environment that can only be described as electric! my wallet can definitely wait to go back, but I for one cant wait for my next adventure at XS.",4
review_574091,entertainment,"4 stars for the ambiance, 2 stars for the food. I loved the fact that the games here are free and the place has a cool vibe. I ordered the teriyaki chicken wings.  It didn't seem very fresh even though they used a good quality product. The wings were also caked in a very thick, ultra sweet sauce. The drinks are reasonably priced and served cold. The music here is a little bit weird, kinda like stuff they play at Pure or The Bank. What is really great is that all the games here are free. If I was 10 years old I would probably be peeing in my pants. I mean, I am able to beat the ol school X-men game! If I tried to do that at a regular arcade, it would probably cost me 20 dollars in quarters! I might return here for the games and drinks but wouldn't come back here for the food.",2

review_617893,entertainment,"We enjoyed this tour last weekend.  Here's a few comments to help you decide whether or not to do it:\n\nBooking was easy on their website.\n\nMeet up location was not inside as stated on the instructions after booking.  Instead, we met outside in the freezing cold (Vegas is in the 30's/40's right now) with the wind blowing hard.  Disappointing.  Then, the guide started the tour by giving us some history/trivia about Vegas (very cool) but he did it in our outdoor meeting area which was right under a blaring speaker of music that is piped in the outdoor area.  Hard to hear him.  10 steps away was a quiet serene place that he could've done this.\n\nTour guide Joel is awesome - very knowledgeable, doesn't go too fast, cares about the group's experience.\n\nWe visited 5 locations and it took 2.5 hours to do so.  That's fine, because nothing dragged on.  The problem is that I was told on the phone and by email that the tour would start at 3p and end at 430p.  I was upset that we were just barely getting to our 5th restaurant at 510pm.  We had somewhere to be at 530pm so we had to leave the tour early (we tasted the food there first though).\n\nOk - now to the food.  AMAZING, except for our last stop.  All stops had plentiful tasting portions and by the end we were full - a perfect early dinner!  The first 4 stops were absolutely delicious, and fun too.  The manager/host at each restaurant was clearly proud of their work and happy to share info with us about what we were eating, how it's made, etc.  The 5th/last stop was pizza - and it was gross.  Yuck.  My husband and I agree it was the greasiest pizza we had ever eaten....the crust was soaked in it it was that bad.  Yuck again.  Shocking that this stop was included because the first 4 stops were outstanding, using high quality ingredients and techniques.  Yuck on the pizza.  Ok - I think I've got that out of my system now.\n\nOverall - we'd happily sign up for this tour again the next time we're in Vegas....even if it means hearing the same spiel from each restaurant manager and tasting the same food because it was that good.  Oh - except for the pizza....we'd skip the last stop.  And now that we know the tour will last until 530p and it meets outside, we would be better prepared.",3

review_306053,entertainment,"The facilities are very nice. For someone not into competitive karting or introducing others into karting this may be a good place. You'll want something better if you know how to drive and expect a competitive environment.\n\nThe track layout is pretty good but exceptionally narrow. It makes it difficult to pass, except for when the attendant blue flags.\n\nThere isn't a lot of really fantastic karting in this area, but I can't imagine wanting to return here. It's a bit on the expensive side and provides such a sterile and predictable experience that it isn't really any fun.\n\nAdditionally, the timing loop obviously has some problems. They claim the track is .25 miles, but the best time of the week were around 15 *seconds*. So, people are averaging around 60 miles per hour? Not likely. Small nit, but I try to post times on the board and that's just another annoyance.\n\nThere is another karting place near by that I've been to probably 10 times and will continue to be my standard place to go (not naming it in the interest of fairness).\n\nBottom line: If you value cleanliness, modern registration and a sterile experience this is the place to go. If you want to put in hot laps at a place that allows good competition, head elsewhere.\n\n2 very opinionated stars because it simply isn't for me, but others may really like it.",1

Upstairs is where is gets impressive. There are 196 countries on this planet and 193 are represented in this museum as well as certain territories with specific cultures. Each country has it's own section with a plaque of info, musical instruments from that country, a flat screen with footage of people playing music from there with a censor that detects your audio guide and automatically plays it. Awesome! The only possible negative would be that it can be overwhelming, but slow down and just walk by each region and your audio guide will play you a piece.",3

It's longer than wider, which isn't really appropriate for a music venue. While we decided to grab bar chairs and move ourselves up in the middle of it, I'm sure people in the bad could not see the band at all. In my opinion, that ruins a small intimate show. \n\nAdditionally, the service was slow.

We'll definitely be coming back to climb with him the next time we are in the area.",4
review_281574,entertainment,"We were bored one day and wanted to go to a movie, but the movie the young man wanted to watch was only showing here so we drove out. It is in the middle of some weird area and the movie theater is a free standing one not attached to anything -- no mall, nothing.\n\nThe movie theater is like your regular ones, not one of those megapexes, just a regular one. Popcorn and soda were ripoffs! WOW I didn't expect a smaller theater to charge so much! We only got popcorn.... and I couldn't understand how a combo costs the same (in fact, a few cents more) than getting the soda and popcorn separately! Mindboggling that one!\n\nThey were a Regal so I got to use my card for extra points. Other than that, it wasn't anything to write home about!\n\nAnd oh, the seats don't 'recline' back at all -- boo!",2

review_405077,entertainment,"AGGRESSIVE BOUNCERS!\n\nThe place would be a nice hangout if it weren't for the overly aggressive security guards.  My wife and I were hanging out with a couple of friends this weekend.  We were pretty much keeping to ourselves at the patio and hand one of these power hungry jerks decided we had to leave.  He asked me wife if she was ok while we were seated at a table.  She turned to him and said yes and went back to her conversation.  He said 'you're out of here\"" for no good reason.  I said hold on, what's the problem so I had to go too. The guy did everything he could to antagonize me, too.  After starting a loud argument with the little jerk, he got his bouncing buddies to quickly rush us out of the door with no explanation.  They were really aggressive about it, and pretty much pushed the ladies out.  My wife tripped while they were rushing us out and actually fell in the pool.  This guy was just a GOON looking for trouble and using his pay nothing job as an excuse to exert his minimal authority.  And from the other reviews on Yelp, this is not rare for this place..  BEWARE OF THESE BOUNCING LOSERS!\n\nAlso, when I managed to get the waitress to come over so I could pay our bill, she said this was pretty typical for the bouncers and rolled her eyes.\n\nWell, they just lost a customer.  I would NEVER pay another dime and will make sure none of my friends ever go here again either.",0

review_153512,entertainment,"Ended up at the Statosphere last weekend as I had dinner at their Top of the World restaurant. (see separate review).\n\nIt's out of the way - not close to the downtown or the other strip properties. It's also near a pretty sketchy area though things are being done to try to improve the area. \n\nThe interior isn't too bad considering the age of the property and with the things to do high up in the tower, it's too bad you have to pay to get up otherwise it would probably be busier. The tower that is.\n\nI didn't stay in the rooms so from what I was able to see from the parking structure to the tower, management is doing a decent job of drawing people there.

review_324673,entertainment,"LOVE this theater!!  I've been coming here since it opened. They do a lot of business yet you rarely have to wait long in lines to buy tickets or concessions. \nThey have a coffee/ice cream bar, video arcade and a restaurant. You can take the food from the restaurant into the theater. You can even take drinks from the restaurant bar into the movies. They have RSVP seats that are bigger and made of leather. We've splurged for them a few times but their regular sits are roomy and comfortable. \nI became a STUBS member which is a nice bonus. You earn points for buying movie tickets and any food or drinks. Every $100 you spend you get $10 in rewards. For our family it doesn't take us long to add up points. Sometimes I cash in my points for gift cards and give them as gifts. Plus you get discounts or upgrades at the concession stand. You also get to preview movies at times which is pretty cool. If you go a lot you should definitely take advantage of it. \nWe've never had a bad experience. The theater sits in an area (The Waterfront) that is inbetween a poor neighborhood and a wealthy neighborhood so the movie goers are made up of all kinds of people. \nIt's a cool place for families, friends, or date nights.",4

The wait staff in general were charming, funny, helpful, no stress. The pool tables looked like they were in good shape, with enough space between them to feel relaxed and comfortable. Several extra large booths line the wall, and a few partially closed Asian-inspired seating areas line the back for more intimate dining. I didn't try the food but the white brick walls, cozy couches, strong drinks and nice staff make me inclined to give a great review.

We went on 2.15.14 for the hearts picture.\n\nThe space is pretty large, but it gets packed. You are literally all jammed in the room and you feel awfully close to your neighbor.

If you go with a group, make sure you just get their canvases too, so ya'll can sit together!\n\nThe instructor was really helpful. The picture background needed a lot of blending and looked complicated. They are really good at breaking down each step so you don't get confused.

If you're looking for something different to do in Vegas, I would definitely recommend this place!\n\nMake your reservations early though, because some paintings are really popular. \n\nThe location is actually difficult to find.

review_190921,entertainment,"SPOILER ALERT! Details of the show are in this review, if you don't want to know what happens in Blue Man Group stop reading now! \n\nBut i'm guessing that you'll continue reading because like everyone else, nobody really has any idea what Blue Man Group is about. You're usually thinking, \""Blue people? Music? They don't speak, or something?\"" Without actually seeing the show, the general details about this show are vague. \n\nThe show is (for the purpose of trying to boil it down) a comedy/music show. The three blue men are suppose to represent the internet or how social interaction works in this day in age, or are a representation of our personal insecurities. They all have their own silly mannerisms. and the audience feels safe laughing with them because they're all very curious and act socially awkward. This is the style of comedy you sit through for almost 2 hours, but I can assure you it gets confusing and repetitive very quickly. \n\nThe acts in this show include eating Captain Crunch, eating Twinkies, and eating Marshmallows. These are 3 different scenes that each last at least 10-15 minutes a piece. They eat these things while being socially awkward with one another. I swear to god, that's it. Additionally, there is a scene where they show you signs with words on them- and you read them until somebody walks into the auditorium late, at which point they bust those people out with a spotlight and putting them on the big screen. Its just a lot of cheap laughs for a majority of the show. \n\nThere is also a lot of drumming, which takes a certain amount of talent to do... but I'm really reaching to compliment the show when I say that. They drum, and they drum, they hit a few pvc pipes and drum some more. It's kinda 'neat' when they drum over the paint and the paint splashes around, but this is literally all they do they entire show. \n\nThe highlight of the show comes during the grand finale, when the Blue Men pull toilet paper over the audience. The audience is literally entirely covered with toilet paper- but again I can only use the word 'neat' to describe this. It's an exciting rush for about 2 minutes, after sitting through 2 hours of watching them eat food and drumming. \n\nI paid $55 for my ticket via travelzoo, and when I left I felt like I wasted my time... If you do see this show, know that there is NO BAD SEAT in the house, and that the poncho zone doesn't get very wet at all... At the show I went to, the audience wasn't really into it and everyone seemed confused... There was probably a time when Blue Man Group was the hottest show in Vegas, but I think it's time is up... Maybe I'm just out of touch, but this style of comedy/music show just wasn't for me =/",1

Most of the employees here are fun (especially the ones at the video bar, they rock!). \n\nI don't know why but the Valet attendants always ruin the mood for me. When we left and we were all loaded up in the car, the valet attendant says \""you most validate your ticket\"" very rudely.

Oh my god, really??? ANYONE could get their stamp validated from inside the casino, how do they know you were even gambling? And why can't the attendant just take your word for it?

Several dozen pinball machines, as well as a handful of classic arcade games like my mom's favorite, centipede. Easily one of the best values in Vegas or anywhere else as most of the machines only cost a quarter to play, unlike modern arcade games which can cost a couple bucks per credit.

review_284497,entertainment,"Wow - a lot of negative reviews on here! I'm not in agreement, but I can see the point of view of some of these people, and I think what it comes down to is what you're looking for when you go clubbing in Vegas.\n\nNow in fairness, LAX is not as 'pretty' as other places, like 'Surrender' or 'Pure.' It isn't going to win any points for ambiance, for sure. It's an older club and an older hotel and it looks it. So, those looking for 'fancy' won't find it here. Personally though, the key for me when it comes to clubbing is good music, a decent crowd, and enough room to dance.\n\nLike most Vegas clubs, my girls and I got in free, which was nice. \n\nThe crowd is relaxed and casual. Most of the time when I go out in Vegas I'm in a dress and heels. Here I wore jeans and didn't feel underdressed by any means. It's not the kind of place where you need that 'Vegas' dress. Some on here have said the people at LAX are 'ghetto' and I suppose in comparison with XS and more upscale clubs, LAX could be, by comparison, considered 'ghetto' - but I'm guessing it's people who've never been anywhere NEAR the ghetto who are labeling this place as that. I've been to truly GHETTO clubs in my life and this place wasn't really ghetto. The crowd was fine. Didn't see any guys I wanted to dance with, but that's not a necessity for me to have a good time in a club.\n\nWhat IS a necessity for me in a club is good music and this place DELIVERED. I went with my friends, all of whom grew up through the late-80s to late-90s and we were LOVING the music!! Getting all nostalgic, dancing to songs I haven't heard in a while, yet we ALL still knew ALL the lyrics. I can imagine the 20-year-olds in the club that night were probably hating on all the 'old' stuff the DJ was playing, but the 30-year-olds in there were definitely feeling it. Music I can dance to? Love it. Also a plus is that this place wasn't jam-packed. I actually had room to dance!! Most of the \""popular\"" places on the Strip are so full you can hardly move an inch.\n\nAll-in-all: It may not be anything fancy or ultra-special, but when with my friends, our most enjoyable night out in a club was at LAX. Good music, decent crowd, we danced until our feet couldn't take it anymore.",3

review_333120,entertainment,"I've been to Pointe-A-Calliere twice now.  The first time was with Abigail M., and the second was with my parents.  My hands-down favorite part is the multimedia experience or whatever they call it.  It is totally ridiculous and fabulously informative.  There are parts that are baldly racist (like the bit about the Chinaman with the laundry on the corner) and others that are blatantly sterilized (the Natives might not be happy about these new folks moving in), but I feel that they add to the charm of the whole thing.  The tech parts are impressive, and the experience delivers a ton of information in a very short period of time.\n\nThe rest of the museum is also interesting.  I would not recommend taking one of the free tours that are offered, though.  Maybe we just got unlucky, but I think that the tour might have been the most painful 60 minutes of my life.  Mr. Tour Guide had a peculiar fascination with toilets and chamberpots and told some of the worst jokes that I have ever heard (and since I have to listen to my own jokes, this is saying something).  The only thing that he told us that I found worthwhile was that, in the little 5-part diorama thingy that shows how Montreal changes, they rather hilariously indicated which of the miniature people were English by giving them little umbrellas.\n\nI would recommend just wandering instead.  The museum is very interactive and has a lot of multimedia.  It also has some great stuff for kids.  Honestly, though, part of the reason that I enjoyed this place like I did is that most of it is just plain odd.  The final exhibit (love stories in Montreal or something like that) is the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen in a museum; I think that the curator of that portion was probably stoned when (s)he came up with the idea.  The hologram people who tell you about living in Montreal back in the day are absurd.  A fair number of the representations of or information given about Natives is probably slightly racist and/or insulting.  But the museum delivers an enormous amount of information about the city's multicultural background.  And (at the risk of sounding too much like a grad student) I would imagine that the multimedia approach supports and subscribes to the obvious effort that the museum is making to show Montreal's mixed/diverse background.  \n\nI will probably continue bringing visitors to this museum and possibly will even return without them.\n\nOh, I should add that they are apparently working on expanding the underground portion of the museum to include more of the sewer and other remains.  I don't remember when Mr. Tour Guide said that would pan out, but I imagine that it will take quite a while.",3

They are total nazis about carding people (even those who are obviously 30+) and it gets really annoying. I understand that you can't serve people under 21 but seriously, develop and use some judgment and common sense, and remember your customers, instead of pretending to forget someone. In general, the servers seem intent on finding ways to avoid serving you, rather than trying to help you have a good experience. Perhaps they are so focused on gaming that they view non-gamers as a hassle, if this is the case, they have done a very good job of passively-aggressively making it clear.\n\nThe menu is overpriced and fairly pedestrian, although they do offer really good specials at different times.",1

But, i'm a staunch lover of Monta, so my expectations were very high, so there's that.\n \nThe atmosphere is fantastic, if you adore Naruto, and the current anime trends. They blast anime and video game soundtracks, which was fine, but not everyone's cup of tea. The place is trying for a \""maid cafe\"" concept like they have in Japan, but it's a bit lacking. The girls don't wear wig-caps for their head, so their anime-esque wigs look not only low-quality, but VERY messy. They are friendly enough, but seem a bit scared of things, still. My guess is for some, this is their first wait-service job, and it shows.\n\n The food is only average, to me. The gyoza tasted like frozen from a bag, and the tonkotsu ramen was okay, but not as delicious as Monta to me. They give 3, paper-thin slices of bland chashu in the ramen. The one thing I loved about the ramen? The French fried onion straws in it!\n\nBIG props to the fact they serve good boba tea! I got the almond milk tea, and it was delicious! It's good enough that is Tea Planet is busy, i'll gladly stop into here and get my fix.\n\n My thoughts, if you're a parent with a kid hard-core into anime, take them here! You won't starve, and your kid will love the experience. I promise the opening theme to Cutey Honey will get stuck in your head for days, later! ^_^",2
review_605095,entertainment,"Lame storyline, Chinese acrobatics, a hodge-podge of spectacles. Truly sideshow-worthy acts and add the music of MJ. Put all of it together in random order and wait for the finale, then you'll see what a messy tribute this turned out to be.

review_524153,entertainment,"After doing researcher on their wed site, I was excited about gathering a group of moms to play at their open gym. I called to get more information about a specific  event and was told they no longer have that event. However, they did still hold an open gym during that time.  So a girlfriend and I arrived at noon and were told very rudely that we were 30 mins early. There was no classes going on at the time and the little kids area was empty. I told them I had just called and was told 12 pm, and even mentioned the event that they no longer have. The front desk staff did not care and told us that we would have to wait. I asked about the event that was on their wed site and was told that I was wrong, even though I had checked before going that day and it was still on there. The second time going, was not any better and they were still extremely rude and very confrontational. This was my third time going and once again the staff was rude, disorganized and did not care about my business. The open gym is a bit pricey and is only a hour and a half, in which they always open the doors late and then want you to stretch for the first 10 minutes. I have a 22 month old son, so he could care less about sitting and stretching. Then they kick you out  10 minutes before its over, and have you walk across the parking lot for a free snack(small bag of goldfish). The option to stay and play for the last 10 minutes is not available and every staff member(all teenagers) told me at one time or another that open gym was now over.  I would not mind the price or the length of time, if the stuff was friendly!! :(",0
review_641512,entertainment,"Basically, if Calvin the promoter offers you a table and bottles, FIND SOMEONE ELSE because he's the most unprofessional person I've ever dealt with. My friends and I (group of 8 girls) were asked to go to Drai's based on the fact that we would get a table and instead of saying he couldn't pull through (after we were already IN the club) he kept texting us that he would be right up, or he was on his way, etc. etc. \n\nWe ended up having  great time without his help, but it seems like shitty PR to me for them to allow this guy to represent their otherwise pretty cool establishment. \n\nIf it wasn't for this immensely unprofessional and unhelpful guy we would all have left much better reviews.\n\nEDIT: I see this has happened before, so BEWARE",0
review_273568,entertainment,"Good times! Service... Not so much.\nGood pianists, with mediocre singing voices. The one guy does cartoonish imitations, rather than trying to emulate artists or make the songs his own. Shitty requests!!! The patrons at the piano bar on this night thought it was an episode of \""Stump the piano player.\"" Example: one guy requested a non-hit-single B-side from Alice in Chains! Great! The idea of a piano bar is to throw a big party where everyone can sing along, NOT to see how confused and confounded we can make the musicians. The place also had Shitty service! The waitress would show up every 30-40 minutes to sell us an OVERPRICED drink ($8 beer/$11 cocktail).

I was nervous about getting on Big Shot until I seen an older lady get on with no worries. I had to represent for the tall people. I'm glad I rode Big Shot because the experience was cool. I really enjoyed the thrill. Before you can scream the ride is over. The best part about the ride is the view of Vegas once you're lifted to the top. It's best to ride Big Shot early as possible because the lines can become very long (It's very hot on top of the Stratosphere). Definitely put Big Shot on your to do list for Las Vegas.",3

review_552042,entertainment,"Laser tag has been making a big comeback in the Vegas Valley over the course of the last few months. Firstly, King Putt Mini Golf put a Laser Force laser tag facility in their latest property in Henderson. And, even more recently, this facility opened up over on West Sahara. \n\nBattle Blast does not disappoint. There are some minor flaws, but I'll get to those later.\n\nThe facility itself is strictly laser tag (no mini golf or anything like that), and they have a few arcade games in the lobby. Nothing too terribly impressive. Would be nice if they got some classic games in as well, it's always nice to have a better selection of games while you wait for for laser tag game to begin.\n\nOne innovation this place has that sets it apart from other laser tag places is that there is actually a \""viewing deck\"" so that non-players can look down on the blacklit laser tag arena. A very cool idea I have never seen at any other laser tag place. \n\nAs far as the actual laser tag playing experience goes, it is an amazing one. The arena is nearly twice as big as the one at King Putt, with tons of rooms and several second floor areas. Interestingly, I found a lot more adults and teens playing here than kids, although there were still plenty of children to be found as well. It was kind of interesting playing a more competitive game against mature individuals who took the game seriously than a bunch of whiny brats that complain every time they get shot. As far as laser tag arenas go, this just might be the best arena I have ever been in. After each game they even pass out score cards, something I haven't seen a laser tag place around here do in a long time. \n\nThe one main issue I have is with the design of the packs/guns. The guns are a weird shape, and they often give you the \""2 hands\"" error message, even if you are using 2 hands. Likewise, the gun is kind of hard to move around due to the design of the cable connecting it to the pack (you really have to try playing here to see what I mean.)\n\nAny flaws here are minor. All things considered I had a great time. The staff are friendly and helpful, and it is an excellent facility that will not fail to please any fan of the game.",3

The show was an hour and a half with no intermission. \n\nWe were in the 1st Mezzanine and the seats were good. The Coliseum is an excellent venue - very large, nice big stage, plush seats. They even have a bar so you can bring a drink in (note that the prices are way above your typical Vegas price).",4
review_559271,entertainment,"Planning a birthday party for a child can be very stressful in this town, especially once summer arrives. You have to worry about the heat which can limit where you go and if you try to do something new each year, it's pretty easy to hit all of the birthday party places in this town by the time your kid is 7 or 8 and if you have more than one child, forget it! You are almost definitely going to some of those places multiple times! Unfortunately for my son, his birthday is in late June, right before the 4th of July, and everyone is usually out of town. This year, I had his birthday party early so he could invite his whole class before they all disappeared for the summer and I had it at King Putt. Now let me ask this, why do people not RSVP in this town? How are you supposed to plan a party if you don't know who's going to show? You just have to wing it, I guess. And wing it, I did. His whole class was invited and we ended up having 16 kids total and it was fabulous! Our host, Jessica, is without a doubt, one of the most awesomest (not a real word I'm sure but, whatever) people ever! She was super nice and extremely helpful and even got upset when I tried to help her serve food and clean up! She was great with the kids and kept the food and drink coming without me asking for anything! The kids played two games of laser tag and she was in there with the whole group as well. She was on top of it all and cleaned up the room quick as a flash! She even offered to help us bring the presents and leftovers out to the car but that's what hubby and the kids are for-to schlep things for me when my hands are full! Everyone was so nice and so helpful and the kids had a great time. It was the most relaxing party I have ever had for one of my children-and I've had plenty! Jessica made the party seem like an actual party instead of a lot of work for me, which it usually turns out to be.  It even turned out to be less expensive than I thought it would be which was a pleasant surprise. We've decided we will go there more often, just for fun and not just for parties! And the pizza was good too!",4

You would think at least ONE of their useless employees would put up a sign or mention it to us. Okay, fine. \nThe drinks where way too expensive. This is a hole in the wall bowling alley, not a downtown wine bar. At least get a bartender who is capable of a smile to rip me off. Damn. She was so unfriendly!

And Jay Z is literally 20 yards away from you. And you're with the tallest man in the world*. And you're shaking your ass and singing along to some of your favorites and you're drinking vodka redbulls like you used to when you were a rave kid. And every 10 minutes, just when you think the night couldn't possibly get any better, the night grows infinitely better. And if you get up to the front of the standing space, you too can be splashed by the sweat of the performer before you because there are no barricades or annoying security asking you to step back. Yes, my friends. This is The Pearl. \n\nThe venue is awesome, security is friendly and guest-oriented. The only problem was the sound system-the mic was a little distorted and the bass was off.

Notable restaurants by famous chefs (Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill, Spago by Wolfgang Puck). They may be good, but they$ are not cheap!. Dinner entree at Mesa will set you back 35-45, not including salad, appetizer, drinks, dessert. Pizza at Spagos is about $20-25. I also did not like the casino because it is incredibly smoky, and the slot machines seem to be set to pay out very infrequently. We simply did not like the feel of the place, although the Roman architecture and decorations are cool. We decided we would not want to stay here.",1

Was looking for more of a club, and all I found was a glorified bar with activities such as cornhole and ping pong. \n\nI've decided to give Boondocks the nickname  \""Secular YMCA for singles\"".\n\nOur table had a bunch of water on it when we arrived. Didn't look like it was cleaned off properly.\n\nGlad to see there was a DJ, but no once was dancing. There really wasn't a dance floor anyways. Not sure the purpose of the DJ - why not just play music over the speaker system, save that expense , and put it into more marketing & promotion.\n\n80% of the patrons were single.

review_531698,entertainment,"We decided to have my daughters 5th birthday party here.  After 4 years of having a bunch of kids at our house, we decided to leave it to someone else this year.  They basically tell you to just bring the kids & a cake and they will handle the rest.\n\nThey were very helpful when booking the party and made everything pretty seamless.  When we showed up this morning, we were greeted warmly by our party coordinator, Jessie and she brought us to our party room and explained the setup. \n\nWe had the room for 2 hours, the first hour was basically a play hour where the kids get to enjoy all of the bounce houses, rock climbing and toddler play area.  The second hour we spent in the room where the kids got to enjoy pizza, juice and cake.  Our coordinator was with us for this time and helped serve the food and cake.  There was still time left over and the kids were able to play some more.  The bounce houses were very much age appropriate and they stagger the parties so there's not 50 kids running around rampant all at once.  \n\nFor the money, this place couldn't' be beat.  It was clean, organized and there was plenty of staff to man the equipment and make sure the kids didn't injure themselves.  I read the other reviews and think that you also need to assume some sort of responsibility, especially in a place like this, for your kids safety which should mean taking an active role in helping out.  They have a \""sit down\"" area but I tried to walk around as much as possible to make sure the kids were having fun in a safe manner rather than relying on just the staff.  They also gave my daughter a nice book and picture frame which was signed by all the kids at the party as a nice parting gift.\n\nWe looked at other similar places for our daughters party and found Baxter Bunch Playhouse to be the best value for our money.  We left very pleased and hope to return soon!",3
review_176135,entertainment,"I was in Vegas exploring Caesars Palace when a promoter approached me with a hook up to Pure. I didn't have night plans so I decided \""Hey! Why not!\"" The promotion they were giving was half off for guys before 12 AM and free admission for the ladies with drinks for the ladies before 12 AM. I figured the guy was nice and I should check out a new scene. Meh.\n\nThe line was long but it was cool...moved fast. However, the SUPER smoky stuffy feel of Caesars really agitated my allergies. I think it was the low ceilings ...I mean, duh its Vegas...but it was so stuffy and smoky in there that it irked me while waiting in line. \n\nThen once I reached the top of the line, the bouncer doubted that my ID was mine. First off, it WAS! I am 26 years old I do not need to be trying to get in some lame ass club. Second, I don't think bending my ID was going to help if it was fake or not. Then he asked me if I had a credit card on me. Hahahaha. How does that prove if its me? Or if I am \""of age?\"" And, I don't bring my card to the clubs fools, like most ladies with a GOOD MAN...my MAN takes care of my drinks on date night!!! And when I'm with the ladies, I bring cash...so I don't blow it on random high caloried drinks.\n\nI'm from Cali fools..get an ID scanner (our IDs don't look cheap and can be scanned for our info in Cali, or at least a UV LED flashlight. I know, this is Nevada and many people come from out of state...at least invest in the UV LED, they use those in airports. Geez!!!!\n\nOnce I got in there, the club seemed nice... flashy, modern and with tons of rooms and bars. What I liked was there was so many different rooms that catered to different styles of music and when you walked around you can only hear the type of music in your area ...no spill over of the other room's music. The DJ playing EDM + 90's was pretty awesome too! So one star for that. \n\nAlso, the free drinks were vodka only drinks. I didn't care, its just it would of been nice to be told that when the promoter picked me up. He made it seem like all the drinks were free up until 12 AM. So I drank A LOT of Pineapple vodkas that night--- Another star for that!!\n\nI think I still love XS and Tryst over Pure. After midnight, I can barely breath in there.

review_134373,entertainment,"Situated at its original location inside the former Bill's Gamblin' Hall and Saloon.  Just a heads-up, this isn't the same as the rooftop club especially since they have separate means of entry.  This one's underground which can be a little daunting to walk out of afterwards due to the bright sunlight beaming right at you.  \n\nNo line so people are usually chaotically scattered around the entrance.  This is one of those places where actually knowing someone will help you get behind the ropes.  You can, however, get your Benjamins do the talking and get the bouncers' attention.  If you think that'll get you straight through the dance floor, then you're mistaken as everybody, even locals, has to pay for cover charge: $20/ladies and $30/gentlemen.\n\nThis place is usually packed mostly with the crowd from the club upstairs as they desperately survey the dance floor to see who they can persuade to take home for the night.  After that, it gets really weird so make sure you're somewhat inebriated before walking in.  Drinks are actually quite stiff but priced like any others along the strip.  If you need more than liquor to keep the night going, there are usually people going around selling \""illicit substances.\""  With that being said, DO NOT LEAVE YOUR DRINK UNATTENDED as I've seen shady people drop things on random people's booze.\n\nOverall, Drai's After Hours is definitely the best lounge in the valley to keep the party going.

review_403682,entertainment,"I went here with a group of friends because we were going to a concert there (Metal Elvis, meh). We weren't expecting much but were seduced by the convenience of eating at the same place as the show.\n\nThe first problem was that one person in our group made a reservation online, but they had no record of it when we got there, despite our having a confirmation number. So, we had to wait for a table.\n\nThe next problem is that the Mint Julep I had was probably 90% simple syrup. Truly an awful cocktail (not to mention that the waitress had no idea what kind of bourbon they had).\n\nThe service was slow. Some manager type came by and gave us some kind of locals only frequent member card. Not enough for everyone, mind you. Which was fine by me because I hate that kind of crap. Don't need another card to carry around.\n\nThe group shared a plate of nachos which were OK. Kind of hard to screw up corn chips and cheese, so kudos to the Hard Rock for that.\n\nThe special that night was a portabello mushroom sandwich, which seemed to be a reasonably healthy alternative to everything else on the menu. But it was so slathered in cheese and this obnoxious mayo concoction that it really was as much a greasy, drippy mess as any burger. Came with a salad but most of the \""vegetables\"" were white, so that was a disappointment, let me tell you.\n\nWent in suspecting that the Hard Rock Cafe is nothing more than a tourist trap and everything about it confirmed this suspicion.",0

We got in at 10PM and were seated in the back of the house, which normally isn't a bad thing.  Except the venue does not have arena or stadium type, elevated seating.  They are regular, armless chairs organized in rows on the floor.  So the chairs are all at the same level!  I'm 6'2'' tall and my wife is just over 5' tall and could not see a thing!  At least the music is good and loud!  \n\nI feel bad for the girls who looked great and obviously work hard at their craft.  I give a one star rating not for the show, but for the improper venue layout.  I would expect more from any Vegas show, and certainly from the Rio!\n\nShame.",0
review_581246,entertainment,"Came here one Saturday night around 12. It took about 35 minutes to get in being on the guest list. I was with a group of 6 girls so we didn't have to pay to get in. Once we were in we wanted to dance but the dance floor is soooo packed. Luckily we found a spot. We got some drinks and enjoyed the night. The DJ that was there sucked in my opinion but mixed in some pop songs that I liked. The staff is super friendly and they keep that place looking clean! I liked the little \""show\"" they have. Also the sound quality and lights were very great. I don't know if I would come back but it was a good time.",2

I really enjoyed level 3 because there was a lot of hands on opportunities. The simulator was great but be sure to practice before you actually get in the car.  Also, you need to have your AAA card so you can get a free sim ride.  It took my wife and me 3 hours to get through everything.  It is definitely worth going to while you are in Charlotte.",4
review_280854,entertainment,"Spent 4th of July weekend here and loved it.  Read so many good reviews going in that it seemed like it would be a safe bet.  It's definitely a change from staying at every other hotel on the strip, but turned out great.  I've always enjoyed gambling at Bills and stopping in for the cheap alcohol, especially the 99 cent margaritas, and thought it made sense to try staying here.  \n\nThe rates are extremely reasonable.  It is a really quick walk from your room to the strip, so if you need to run back up for something at any point it is very convenient to do so.  You do get use of the flamingo pool which is a huge plus.  That was actually one of the main reasons we did stay at Bills.  That pool in the summertime is worth it.  The rooms itself are fine, nothing special, spacious enough, cleaned before 11 am everyday.  Its a perfect room if you're like me and you use it to simply shower and sleep.  Overall good stay, I would stay here again, and am content with the service and stay.  Also, we never had an issue with strip noise and we're staying on the first floor facing the strip.",3

I find myself nostalgic for the Lafontaine skating pond. \n\nIt's a great big open space, the ice is kept clean, there are lockers inside, and it's all free if you have your own skates. As a newcomer to Montreal, this was an epiphany - you can just go skating whenever you want! We strapped little \""bob\"" skates onto my toddler's snowboots, dragged our sled on the ice with us, and had many a great day out. After skating and sledding, we'd get some hot cocoa in the cafe upstairs, then trek home to nap. \n\nThinking about it almost makes me wish winter were still here. Almost.",4
review_567193,entertainment,"Very fun experience I must say.  There is really good people watching here because you can be sat right next to the casino floor.  And this is the only place at the Wynn that you can get a decent meal at 3AM (at least I believe so).\n\nSpaghetti and meatballs on the late night menu.  A bit on the pricey side, but hey, you can't expect any less from a top notch Vegas hotel.  I'm a huge fan of the spaghetti and meatball, but I think this place can work on their recipe.  Call me crazy but I tasted too much fennel... but it was 3AM so who knows what I was tasting.  I also found a bit of a sausage in my pasta. (I pretended I was upset with the server in that the kitchen accidentally dropped food in my pasta that wasn't supposed to be in it.  But to be honest, I was pleasantly surprised.  It's like when you get that random onion ring in your fries at Burger King.  Best feeling EVER!!!)  But the waiter said that they add sausage to their marinara on purpose for flavoring.... Hmmmmm, should I believe him??  Our server could have been completely serious, or he could be really witty and thought of a great response right on the spot.  I will never know, but I will always remember this night and that lonely sausage.",3
review_381026,entertainment,"So I was introduced to this station about 6 months ago by a fellow yelper who goes by Amy D... She has a wicked 8-10 spot on Tuesdays and I thoroughly enjoy listening to it on a weekly basis. Well, I was happened upon an opportunity... Nay! A priviledge of being a guest on this FABULOUS show and, being the attention whore that I have been labeled, I accepted.  I won't go into HOW I found myself being handed this prestigious title of KWSS Guest, but it involved a House of Clubs, Twitter, and a whole lot of begging (on my part)...\n\nThere I was... in the presence of 100% pure, raw (Can't decide which word to use \""Talent\"" or \""Creativity\"") and in a pretty bad ass studio. The Fabulous Amy and I discussed all the important topics of the nation/world and stumbled on numerous great ideas. One being a cure for cancer! Okay, we didn't discover a cure per say... but we did briefly talk about it.\n\nThe listeners were top notch and the atmosphere was professional, yet extremely comfortable. Plus, we actually got some free talent from a caller! He was awesome and sang me happy birthday.  It was sexy.\n\nThanks for a great time, Amy and KWSS! You rock, alternatively!",4
review_119925,entertainment,"Slots, slots, slots!\n\nIt makes me laugh that they encourage you to gamble as soon as you step foot into the airport of Sin City. Sadly, like all the casinos, the stench of cigarettes and cigars also lingers over everything here.\n\nIt kind of sucks that it's a little ways out from the Strip so you have to either shuttle or taxi in, but that's just a minor complaint. You can't really get lost, what with the bajillion signs that they have everywhere pointing the way. I've heard that security can be kind of a nightmare here, but Boyfriend and I breezed through TSA and checking in, so fingers crossed it's like this every time.",2
review_547917,entertainment,"I didn't know what to expect when we were headed to this.  I was excited and looking forward to coming here our whole trip.  I did have two Groupons that basically made this B1G1F, which was a really good deal.  \n\nWe looked at the really cool fish tank they have there and we saw it on the TLC fish tank show.  It is something you must see even if you're not going to check out the mob attraction.  It's outside of the ticket area.\n\nWe showed up and were greeted by ticket staff and they were very friendly.  We took some funny pictures and we started our journey.  This is very interactive with live actors which makes this so entertaining.  You get to see everyone from a police officer, to the head mob boss, to his henchmen. (I don't want to really give anything away)  But in the end, we were welcomed to the family. :)\n\nThere is also a measum part in the middle of the attraction.  There's this really cool computer that shows Vegas from the 20s-2007.  You can see the different hotels throughout the timeline, which ones have been around since say the 50s, which ones that have came and gone and that the Flamingo is the only one that's been around for literally forever.  There are tons of facts about the mobsters, the personal belongings and various other things.\n\nWe decided to buy two of our pictures because it was very reasonably priced.  I believe it was $23 with tax for two of them.  My bf also bought a shot glass for $5.  Not too shabby.\n\nYou can spend anywhere from an hour to three hours checking things out.  We were here for about 1 hour 45 minutes.  There are coupons being handed out all the time, you can check to see if there's a yelp deal or check out Groupon once in a while also.",3
review_597117,entertainment,"I was so excited about coming here because of all the hype.. but was so disappointed. I kept getting lost because of all the different floors. And you had to take the overcrowded stairs every time you needed to go up. The elevator was only for exiting the club. It was so hard to navigate anywhere unless you stayed in one place. The bartenders were taking forever flirting with each girl customer before moving onto the next drink order. The drinks are really expensive too, cocktails around $16-$18, and a glass of champagne $22... The only good thing about this place was the decor (which reminded me of their restaurant in San Francisco), and the amount of time we waited to get in, only about 10-15 minutes considering we arrived around 11pm-12am without any promoters walking us in or special VIP/guestlist line. Another thing, my friends booked a table for the night, and you couldn't even see the stage or the dj from the table they got.",0
review_181832,entertainment,"Not my favorite Cirque du Soleil show, but it's an okay show.\n\nThere is not a lot of a story line to the show, at least not one as memorable as some of the others I've seen.  The high dives and some of the water tricks were pretty amazing, but I found myself often getting bored in the show.  \n\nThe theater is beautiful, and the costumes and makeup are right on par, but in the end, I wasn't really impressed overall.  I find that I usually forget to breathe during their shows, but this one wasn't really as such.\n\nIt was a solid show.  Definitely a good show, but for my money?  I'd probably prefer to go elsewhere on the strip for a better Cirque show.  (Make sure you use an M Life card when purchasing your tickets.  Best deal I could find on them!)",2
review_334746,entertainment,"This small church and museum on the north side of Old Montreal is the on the site of the original church founded by Sister Marguerite Bourgeoys, one of the first settlers of Montreal, and the museum is dedicated to her life.  The church is...just a church with interesting stained glass windows, stone altar, and the regular assortment of religious art, but it does have some interesting features with replicas of sailing ships adorning the chapel (it seems the chapel is a favorite with sailors).  It's the views of Old Montreal and the Vieux-Port from the church tower make it worth the trek to this part of Old Montreal.  The small museum is located in the crypt of the church and has an adjacent associated archeological site that you can also tour.  The museum would be worth the admission to a someone interested in the history of a Canadian saint (and a woman to boot), but I can't comment on the archeological site since I didn't partake of it.\n\nThe chapel is thankfully free, but there is an $8 admission fee for the museum (it's steep considering all you get is the museum and tower access for the views).  You can add the archeological site for an extra $2, which might make it more interesting (I don't really know).  The closest metro stop is Champ De Mars, but it's still a hike up a really steep hill.\n\nI say skip it if you need time for something else, but if you have the time (or the interest) then it's worth at least an hour's visit.",2
review_111268,entertainment,"I played this course several times weekly for three years in college and never ran out of money and never got bored with the course. You can see a lot of Pete Dye in this course - railroad ties, swails that are impossible to play from, so on and so forth. A very good challenge (It plays to a 73.8/131) with a shorter, narrower front nine and a relentlessly long back nine that finishes with four of the most difficult holes you will ever play. The signature hole is #16, a 248 yard par three with a forced carry over water to the green. The hole itself snakes to the right with water right and short, and the prevailing wind fights the fade you will want to hit. In 300+ tries, I've only ever birdied this hole once.\n\nThe staff is great. Always friendly and very nice to students like myself. The price is great for students, not sure about everyone else though. I've been to the restaurant only a few times, but the food was good and I would definitely go back occasionally if I still lived there.\n\nOh, how I wish I was back in college again. Being able to play this gem every time I had a chance made work+classes+malnutrition very bearable.",4

review_190918,entertainment,"I hate to be so negative towards a show that has fairly good aspects. But I just expected so much more. Coming from a show that wasn't cheap to see. Or that has been going strong for ten years or so now. But I believe someone under the age of 12 would surely give this show four stars or more. \n\nThe acts are cool. The blue men are funny. And it was a good experience. However, the acts almost seem to repeat themselves in different ways. You just hear so much about this show you kinda go in expecting to be blown away. Don't get me wrong. It's a good show for both kids and adults. But it's mainly a family show. Rather than a couples show. \n\nBut there was one particular part, that had me in big smiles. That I won't forget. Towards the end of the show, they drop tons and tons of paper over the croud. That just keeps pouring and pouring. Almost like a snow white out. I swear I was laughing like a little kid. The audience kinda just pushes the paper towards the front till it's all gone. It's really cool. But unfortunately it wasn't enough to give it more stars. Two and a half stars if I could. Blue men, change the show up and Ill be there.",1

review_345197,entertainment,"I've finally found a place in Pittsburgh that stays open past 2am! For years now I thought that there was an unwritten rule that all nightlife had to end at 2am.\n\nZen feels like a club uprooted from NYC that just hasn't been adopted by Pittsburgh yet. It's very chic inside and I like the strict dress code which makes sure everyone inside actually look like they're supposed to be at a club, not a house party.\n\nI'm not sure what the cover is since we got bottle service. It was 2 bottles for a party of 10 in the main area, which is a pretty sweet deal especially with $80 Absolut bottles on Friday night. The music didn't get good until after midnight, which is when I think they switched DJs, and more hip-hop and R&B started playing. With their hours open until 3:30am, they probably didn't want to exhaust all their good tunes too early before the crowd came in. Also, the crowd didn't get lively until 1am, which is probably when people from the other about-to-close clubs start flowing in.\n\nThe specials there were pretty decent too. $2 wells and $1 miller lites before midnight on Friday and since the place doesn't get populated before then, ordering a drink at the bar was pretty easy.",3
review_284576,entertainment,"I guess I must be old school but when I go to a club I go to dance, not to pay a ridiculous amount of money to sit in 'VIP', get bottle service, and dance around my table with the same people I came to the club with.  So I gave this place two stars for those who want to feel special and get a table.  You can stop reading this review and go to this place if that's what you're looking for.  If you want to dance, here's the 411.  We stayed at the Mandalay Bay and were looking for a Hip Hop club.  There wasn't one there so we heard Luxor had one.  The music sounded good from the outside so I didn't mind paying $50 for me and $30 for the wife to get in.  But once we got in I realized I made a mistake.  I guess it's because I'm a Californian but I would like to think I know what a good club is and this isn't one.  The main floor is roped off to give those who pay for a table 10 extra feet of room while leaving the cheapies (like me) with no room to dance.  This left a very narrow path down the middle of the club which is meant to serve as the minuscule dance floor and walkway.  The layout could be more conducive to dancing but since this club wants to focus on bottle service don't bother coming here if you just want to dance.  And the music: what I thought was good hip hop on the outside turned out to be poorly mixed music.  The DJ kept having a lull from one song to the next leaving an awkward pause between tracks.  This caused the crowd to stand around in between songs because he couldn't mix the music correctly.  Anyways... If you want to pay extra money to make yourself feel special then come here.  If you are trying to bump and grind find another spot and save yourself the money.",1

review_79358,entertainment,"I absolutely love free stuff, and when it's not free then super cheap will do. Cinemark fits the bill with it's dirt cheap movies. I mean .75 for a movie on a Monday? Wow, that's just unheard of, and the theater is pretty nice for being a discount theater. I go here as often as possible because you absolutely cannot beat the price. \n\nI've never stepped onto a sticky floor yet in this place and every chair I've plopped myself in was just as comfy as the last. The funniest thing to me, and I'm probably testing some of your ages here is that the doors to the theater always make me feel like I'm walking into Pee Wee's play house. I love it!! I'm waiting for him to spring out one day and tell me the word of the day so I can scream whenever I hear it. \n\nBut, then I'm reeled back to reality when the previews start and they tell me to be quiet and turn off my cell phone. No secret word of the day here... but as far as movies go, this is an awesome place. I don't typically eat the food at most theaters but be forewarned, if you do, it'll cost ya. It's about the same as getting it at a normal theater, but even so, you can't beat the fact that usually about 4 people can go see a movie here  for the price of one ticket at a first run theater. \n\nGreat choice for a date night, or just because. I heart this place a ton. :)",4
review_313136,entertainment,"This is a review for the Big Shot ride.\n\nThe ride on a beautiful warm clear October night? Amazing. The view of Vegas and the feeling of weightlessness made this a great experience for me. I could have gone on the ride several times; alas, I just had one ticket, and a fairly pricey one at that ($18). Yes, it is scary, but in a pleasant way.\n\nThe observation deck is also worth a visit. Had we not been heading out for other activities, I would have loved staying a while. \n\nThe building had a bit of a rundown feel. The process of getting to the top of the tower was unnecessarily complicated. Get on that elevator, then go up; get off; get on another one; no, not this one; no not that one either. Oh, those people aren't going on the ride? They have to get off here. Etc. etc. etc. It took about 10 minutes to get up to the right floor and probably 15 to get back down!\n\nThey don't need an MBA to come in and analyze their organization. Just grab anyone coming down and ask about the elevator situation and figure out a way to get people up and down efficiently. It's not that hard. \n\nGreat ride, though.",3
review_532471,entertainment,"To begin this review fairly I was must mention that I am a late 80's baby so most of the music that I recall is from the 90's.  I know Gladys Knight, Diana Ross, The Temptations and some of the other groups that were \""impersonated\"" and the main singing lady, Jin Jin Reaves, has one hell of a voice and definitely a lot of talent. \n\nI left feeling some kind of way for a couple reasons:\n\n(1) I felt underwhelmed by the show after the first girl (Jin Jin) and the first group guy performance because it dawned on me that they were just going to run in the back, change outfits and pretend to be someone else - for tickets that are $60-80 a piece, I would expect more - ESPECIALLY in Vegas. \n\n(2) The vocals were mediocre once you kind of got the hang of what was going on - very glee-ish or halloween night at the karaoke bar is more like it.  Not saying those folks aren't talented, but the show needed more \""oomph\"" - they were constantly having to go thru and try to hype up the crowd where as in a good show the crowd is hyped - think Michael Jackson - when he would turn his head - people would fall out and have to be carried out on a stretcher - this was before the concert even started he just turned his head.  If you're going to have a show in Vegas I'm ready to be amazed - I view Vegas as the ultimate performing arts center.  Just my opinion.",1

I went to Culinary Dropout on a Saturday night -- there was a live band, but they were WAY too loud, and pretty terrible. We had to shout at our waitress, and still she had trouble hearing us and vice versa. I literally couldn't have a conversation with the person sitting across the table from me.\n\nThe \""vibe\"" was interesting. Half the fun was looking at all of the obscurely dressed \""alternative\"" crowd that was eating there. Many of the patrons seemed to give off the \""my world is a dark abyss and my parents just don't understand me\"" aura. Unfortunately, I could not share my quippy observations with anyone else at my table, given the noise. The decor was pretty abhorrent, and the restaurant was uncomfortably cold (it was nighttime in early February), given that they left all the doors and windows open.\n\nI had the trout, which was very tasty. Additionally, the pretzel bites with fondue appetizer was VERY good. At the end of the day though, I'd rather eat at Wendy's were I can actually converse, than some hipster joint where I can't hear anything other than a jazz musician (who didn't seem to fit the scene... he was the only non-white I could spot in the crowd) eating the microphone and playing the harmonica (poorly) at 10,000 deciles.",1

There were many 40+ something men going after early to mid 20s girls/women. That resonated throughout the place.

Our prior experiences were great and fabulous until the last visit last May of this year.   I was so livid when I checked out of this hotel. First of all, we stay at HR because we like the fact that we can go to Sunday Rehab without any problems and get in for free. As we checked in the hotel, we were told that the policy changed and we need book our room for Sunday night to get the same privileged we had before.  The front desk was trying to charge us the regular rate and said the Rehab entrance fee was about $100-$250 per person.  We opted for another room and managed to get in ourselves for free at the door.  We felt like they were trying really hard to get us to stay one more night and pay a higher room rate.  \n\nI was so livid when I checked out of the hotel.  One thing for sure is that I will not stay at Hard Rock going forward.  I feel that they use the pool party to act \""big and mighty\"" and lost their great customer service they once had.  \n\nNext trip will definitely be at Encore and my Sunday Rehab days is over.  This experience totally turned me off!!",0
review_231425,entertainment,"One visit to Vegas last summer decided to check out rehab since my friends where having a cabana and bottle service. Our cabana was soo high up that it felt like a hike just going back up from the pool. Our waitress so happened to be the former singer from what I believed the group \""blaque\"" years ago. \n\nThe pool was so dirty that I was afraid to get in regardless, of how hot and drunk I was. But since, I got dragged from my gfs to get in, I did. The pool was so icky and warm that i felt gross in it. The people there was not cute at all! \n\nMaybe, I was just so tired from partying nights before or maybe because experiencing a better pool party at \""we republic\"" and \""ditch Friday's\"" at Palms that Rehab killed it for me. Only thing good was the free cabana and drinks",2

review_144997,entertainment,"The skating floor is great and some days the atmosphere is ok. But unfortunately this place lacks in having an Adult Night for those that would like to skate without having to skate into kids all the time. I've seen some crazy collisions with kids not looking or just playing games like \""Tag\"" with other kids, cutting off people and pushing each other or going in the wrong directions of the flow of the skating. Refs really don't do much about it either. Thinking about what's best for business is if both locations should really consider at least 1 day out of the week, to have an Adult Night...I'm sure business would not suffer, I believe it would actually pick up More.",0

review_179660,entertainment,"So a couple of friends and I decided to hit up Vegas the weekend before Thanksgiving and, seeing as I'd never been to Tao, we decided that it might be fun to check out the club everybody seems to be talking about!\n\nHeaded over on a Friday night--I suggest you put your name on the guestlist and get there before midnight. It helps, I swear. It also helps to surround yourself with a large number of girls if you're a guy, so thank God we had that cleared. \n\nFirst things first: the girls in the bathtubs? They look as if they hate their very existence and spend more time covering their boobies than sloshing about all sexy-like in the water.\n\nThe drinks? Please. Laughable at best, extremely expensive (12 dollars for a shot?!), and small!\n\nThe music is your basic hip-hop-Top 40 mix, which tells me the club has yet to go super mainstream. There's more to music than Tupac's \""California Love\"" or Kanye's rehash.  Tao would be a much cooler place if they mixed it up and threw in some electro.\n\nI will say, however, that the decor is something out of a movie. Over the top, ridiculously artificial, and a bit too overblown for my taste. The huge Buddha staring at you over the dancefloor makes you feel like praying, not dancing.\n\nIf you don't have a table (and they have millions! In places you wouldn't expect!) don't think you'll sit down ANYWHERE. Security's tight, so if you're tired or your feet hurt, suck it up.",1
review_41948,entertainment,"LOCATION: Conveniently located right off of Scottsdale Rd, not TOO far south of the 101, in central Scottsdale. It is actually part of a park with a kids' playground. Easy free parking.\n\nSTUFF TO DO:\nFor the \""adults\""-There is a train car that has been restored as a small museum with some artifacts, displays, photos, etc.  Additionally, there is a large building that houses a massive miniature train set that has villages, forests, mountains, etc. It is amazing and I couldn't stop looking! The detail is incredible and it will bring out the kid in you! The kids will be amazed as well! \nFor the \""kids\""- There is a carousel and a kiddie train to ride. There is also a large playground.\n\nVALUE: It is cheap to enter the little museum (under $5 I think?). It is free to enter the building to see the miniature train sets (but donations keep this place going so don't be stingy).\n\nAGE RANGE: Geared towards families or kids, but someone who is into trains/history/really awesome miniature villages would enjoy it as well!\n\nCHRISTMAS LIGHTS TRAIN RIDE: For a few dollars, you can ride a miniature train into a winter wonderland. Borrow someone's kid if you need to; it is pretty fun if you are a kid at heart and like Christmas lights. Might be a fun light hearted date too! Tip- the line gets INSANELY long. Line up at 5:30 to wait in line for the 6:00 ride. If you don't, there is a chance you will be waiting for WELL over an hour.\n\nSOUVENIRS/FOOD: The gift shop needs some more...gifts!! The snacks pretty much consist of ice cream and hot dogs in foil. I think a small cafe would do well in this location.\n\nFINAL VERDICT: If I had kids of my own (and if I lived in Arizona), this would definitely be a place to which I would return...and I would definitely make the Christmas lights night train ride an annual tradition.",3
review_280483,entertainment,"After my visit to Eide's Entertainment, I must say I am not a fan and was in no way impressed. A fact that was even more disappointing, considering it was the only store out of about five or so that I wanted to visit during my weekend in Pittsburgh that I actually got to shop at. Seeing how much other people love it, I feel that my unhappiness with Eide's probably needs some further explanation. \n\nFirst of all, this place is much more of a comic book store than it is a record store, something I was completely aware of going into it. However, I was still disappointed with the selection of records that the store offered. It didn't seem very diverse to me and much of it seemed extremely over priced. I ended up only buying one record from Eide's because of this. In addition, and the biggest reason I am giving Eide's two stars, is the staff here is very, very rude. No, I don't mean your typical \""I work at a record store so I am better than you\"" rude you get at some stores. The employees working on the record level of the store were just plain nasty. I saw a 40+ year old man yell at my little sister for putting a record back out of alphabetical order. Keep in mind, my little sister is about 5 feet tall and maybe weigh 100 lbs. I guess that this guy gets his jollies off of bullying little girls, who knows, but it was unacceptable. To top it off, he did everything but accuse my sister of stealing the record, because he couldn't find it. Of course he couldn't find it because my sister did put it back in alphabetical order where it went. Ass.\n\nLong story short, I will never ever return to Eide's Entertainment and I would discourage anyone else who cares about being treated with some sense of decency to do the same. These guys really need to get over themselves.",1

review_284563,entertainment,"Booooooooooooooooooooooooooo.\n\nDon't. Bother.\n\nTrust the Yelpers on this one. Trust us. Seriously. Or you'll be sorry.\n\nThis place is wickity wickity wackness. My boyfriend and I only decided to show up here because we were staying at Excalibur and were given a \""free admission for two before 12 am.\"" coupon. We showed up at 12, but had to wait in a line and didn't get in until 12:15. Okay, so I was hoping they would honor the coupon anyway, but figured they would at least give us some kind of discounted rate. Well, the woman working the \""cash box\"" or whatever it is just looked at us and said, \""no, i'm not taking those anymore and it's $90 for the both of you. $60 for him, $30 for you.\""\n\nWHAT?!!!!!\n\nI have been to and partied in Vegas a myriad of times and never, NEVER has some club, especially of the likes of LAfreakingX had the audacity to charge such outrageous prices for entrance. I stopped my boyfriend from handing over his credit card, asked her to repeat herself, responded with, \""hell to the no,\"" performed an About Face and started to make our way out. One of the bouncer/security guard dudes caught my reaction and our attempt to leave and stopped us trying to figure out why we were so disgusted. In hopes to keep our business, he offered to slash the cost in half. Just like that. In a snap, from $90 to $45. In retrospect, any place that obviously inflates their admission like that shouldn't have received any of our business, but since we were there already, we decided to take the offer.\n\nMistake. \n\nUnderwhelmed. The dance floor is small and ridiculously cramped. The club does offer some space, but the majority of it was roped off for \""VIP\"" or \""Bottle Service\"" that no one seemed to take advantage of. Probably because this place sucks major bolas. So you have a super cramped dance floor, and empty space you can't even use. Drink prices were ridiculous. $28 for two drinks. What kind of crack are they smoking? I may have been able to overlook all of this if the one key factor in a great club existed: Great Music. Negative on this as well. The music here was hours of the same Auto-Tuned hip hop crap that sounds like one constant stream of yuckiness. There were the occasional Biggie or Jay-Z hits sprinkled in. Enough for me to shake it for a minute or two, but then back to the same old crap. It's funny how much more your feet hurt in heels when you're busy not having a good time or not enjoying the music.\n\nWe will never ever return to this place. And I urge you Yelpers to stay away. Even if the entrance is free for you, there are so many better places to spend your time.",0

review_238501,entertainment,"I went to the Gallery for the first time this June and saw the American Modernism exhibit, which is made up of loans from the fantastic Museum of Fine Arts (MFA), Boston. It took about 45-60 minutes to get through the whole exhibition. The extra 15 minutes was if you were to stay and watch the Georgia O'Keefe documentary in another room. This also assumes you look at each painting and listen to the commentaries on each one that has one.\n\nI have to say the woman they chose to read some of the audio commentaries on the audio unit should be replaced. She BUTCHERED some of the artist names and concepts. Did anyone instruct her how to pronounce these words correctly  before recording or proof-listen to the final product? They could have got a art history student at UNLV who would have done a better job.\n\nThe entrance fee is a bit high at $15 for adults, but if that actually helps cover the cost of the exhibition, I suppose its okay. The museum wasn't that busy for a Sunday late afternoon though. Wynn should buy one of the original Dog's Playing Poker pictures and put it in the Bellagio to poke fun at all the people ignoring the fine art to gamble mind numbingly.\n\nNow that the Guggenheim LV shut down, this the only fine art gallery on the Strip. Don't forget the LV Museum of Art on West Sahara though. And no, the Liberace Museum does not count no matter how many sequins and sparkly things are on the walls.\n\nVerdict: When you have $15 bucks left of your allotted $500, go enrich yourself at the art gallery instead of enriching the casino.",3

I am not handy whatsoever (!!!) and usually can only be dragged here to look at plants. \n\nSo I went there a few days ago looking for shelf brackets. I had a picture in my phone, just in case. I asked a person, who asked another person, who showed me some but then saw the picture in my phone and showed me some different ones. None of them looked close enough (I HATE returning stuff), so I said 'forget this'. \n\nThen I went to look at plants. I found a lovely vining plant marked from $19.98 to $6.00. Of course it rang up at $12.98 or so. I explained to the friendly young man working the garden center register, who called for assistance. That individual walked over to see the plant in question and snottily pointed to the price tag. The kid at the register told him it was wrong and where to look (based on my description) for the $6.00 sign. He found it, it was adjusted, and I went home with my plant. \n\nThe plant is gorgeous, otherwise I'd be pretty tempted to give them 3 stars. \n\n(Oh, and I found the correct brackets at a local hardware store when an old man working there saw me wandering around and chased me down to help me.

review_3765,shopping,"I'll be the first to admit that I'm a little weary of shopping at thrift stores. The clothes always smell like they have been in the attic or someone's basement. The store washes the clothing but you can sometimes smell the faint scent of cigarettes. Not all the clothes are bad though.\n\nI like to shop for the high end shirts and pants. They tend to have a lot of items and the prices are out of this world. They have a lot of clothes are are still new with the tags on them and every thing. I recently purchased 6 shirts, 3 pairs of pants, a winter jacket and a Paula Dean sauce pan and 2 purses for only $55. These are nice clothes too, not cheap t-shirts with holes or stains on them.  I always take the clothes home and wash/sanitize them first before I wear them. \n\nThey have more than just clothes too. There are silverware, pots and pans, dishes, halloween costumes, shoes, baby items and even furniture and electronics. The only down side to this store is that there is no dressing room. So the only real thing you can try on are coats and shoes. I see people trying shirts and pants on over there clothes sometimes but it proves rather difficult unless they are men. My sisters tho did wear leggings to the store so they could try on the dress pants. They bought designer brands like BCBG, Black house|White market, Arden B, claibourne, Van Hausen, and lots more!!!\n\nThis stores prices are beyond great, almost everyday they have a special. On saturday it was half off all color tags except red. I found so many items $4 pairs of pants, $3 shirts, $7 jackets. The Paula Dean pot was only $4 as well and that was great coming from a thrift shop. \n\nIf your ever interested in shopping here it's best to go on a Wednesday or Saturday early!!

review_17535,shopping,"With its remodeling, this Walgreens has undergone a strange and wonderful transformation that is probably best viewed at 11 p.m. on the night before a major holiday. I may have to go back on Christmas Eve to confirm this hypothesis.\n\nThe deal here is that drugstores, convenience stores, dollar stores, grocery stores, and discount department stores (Target, Walmart) all want each other's business and are gradually transforming into one another. So this Walgreens is sort of a baby Walmart: smaller! cuter! friendlier! oh-so-adorbs! let's chuck it under its sweet dimpled chin and buy lots of seasonal candy!\n\nWhile rival CVS has gone the route of wide aisles with cheerful-yet-strangely-useless signage, Walgreens is packing the merchandise in. The experience is much more like the drugstores I remember fondly as a child: narrow aisles, tons o' stuff, and you never know what you'll find. It has gone hogwild for minor convenience electronics -- the stuff like car adapters and chargers where it's a pain to figure out what store even to try. Also: walls of Ferro Rocher! \n\nThere may be a real niche here for \""what I want is too specialized for QT or Circle K to carry it, but if I have to face Walmart or the grocery store or the mall, I'm gonna cry\"" shoppers. Keep an eye out for the house brands that are now being featured prominently (nice!, de-lish, savings with a smile), as the pricing on these can be really, really good. \n\nIn a sensible move, this Walgreens has recognized that people who are buying cat litter, batteries, lipstick, cold medication, bourbon, and orange juice at 4 a.m. are not people in any shape to figure out how to queue. The cash registers are approached by a cattle run built from candy and small-electronics displays, and as a person who's recently endured the Camelback/16th CVS's Queue of Mass Confusion, I am grateful that there is no ambiguity about where to line up and who's next.\n\nI want to see what happens with the displays when Christmas is no longer dominant before I get too giddy, but this store looks to have become a lot of fun.",3

review_603785,shopping,"I love the lounging options scattered throughout the mall, the live music was a nice touch, and the mister fans are dreamy, but the store selections were less than impressive. I enjoyed my time there, but I think it had more to do with the fact that it was opening weekend and I had gift cards and other goodies handed to me more than anything else. \n\nThat said, I'm not a big time brand junkie and upscale shops don't tend to wow me. I'm sure there are many who will really appreciate this place. Like the countless people who waited in a humongous line for who knows how long just to get into the Coach store. I bet they loved it.  Me? I might go back for Wetzels Pretzels and a nice misty outdoor stroll, but that's about it.",2
review_428705,shopping,This review is solely based on their market section. This place has a legitimate halal butcher shop section. This is hard to come by in this city. The meats are tasty if you want better ground beef let them grind you a piece of meat. They are friendly and work hard.I am so happy I found them. I wish they had better selection of rice and the produce section was better marked. Overall pretty good,4

I was looking for some twin size thin cotton blankets easy to wash and hang dry for my dog and the prices were $14.99 of course somewere high quality items which u would have to pay new retail store price $40-50 but still overpriced. I finally found a small blanket for $7 on sale.,2
review_148720,shopping,"The one star refers to Sales Associate, Michelle.  I requested alterations for an ankle length pant that was a bit too long.  Michelle was sent to the dressing rooms to assist with this and immediately projected a negative attitude and rude tone.  Instead of assisting politely and patiently to determine the length of the pant, she asked another customer if she needed help.  I had to wait for her to finish with the other customer.  She insisted that she couldn't assist with determining the length of the pant, due to my socks being on.  She did inform me that the pant came in a short length and that she'd have to make a call.  After making the call, she informed me that indeed the pants come in a short length, in all colors.  I stated that I wouldn't be able to try them on and she abruptly shouted \""they fit the same\""!  When I voiced my concern with the manager, she informed me that they don't actually fit the same; the short length is a bit shorter in the rise.  Without saying a word about my thoughts of Michelle, my daughter said \""She's an angry elf\"".  Michelle's tone and attitude was not the same with the other customer.  She showed her patience and a calm demeanor.  Maybe this Michelle is prejudice towards Japanese women.",0

Stopped in for some emergency cat food after a late night Yelp event nearby, and was pleasantly surprised by the friendly staff, clean and organized layout, fresh produce, and good prices.\n\nLately I've noticed an increase in cat food prices, and for the small size bag I can expect to spend $6 for nearly every brand unless I have a coupon or a sale price. Luckily, the $4 prices I usually expect were still in effect here, so I scooped up two bags.\n\nSwung by the meat department and noticed several orange \""manager special\"" stickers on discounted turkey items (spicy sausage and Jennie O ground), which was reminiscent of Albertsons and Sprouts' meat department sales.\n\nManagement was an active presence in the store, moving throughout and discussing planned product placement changes with staff, who were good about asking if I needed help locating anything.",2

I'm fine with paying a bit more for great customer service, but the prices are significantly higher and often the customer service is no-where to be found. It is hard to navigate this store and my experience is that finding someone to help you is often as difficult as finding what you are looking for, if not more so. Another problem is with what the store calls \""seasonal items.\"" In other words, be prepared for the possibility that whatever you buy will not be returnable, even if it is unopened and unused. I have found that Ace does have a different / larger selection than Home Depot or Lowe's on certain specialty items (for example, signs and doggie doors). But I still begin with Home Depot or Lowe's first and visit Ace only as a last resort.",1
review_519738,shopping,"This is the kind of thrift store where you go in hope of finding something amazing, and either you do, or you leave empty-handed. It's about 2/3 housewares (including furniture) and 1/3 clothes.\n\nThe stock is distinctly curated, not the randomness of the Goodwill down the block, so cut glass and crystal are heavier on the shelves than random glassware of randomness.

I would love to do the hiring if only allowed. This is not just a service thing. This is a management thing. Ever since I can remember they have had the worst managers I have ever experienced. T.J.

I have since sold my stock and have cut my shopping here by more than 50%. And I mean, shopping. I was a junkie. I'm not sure I can ever cut it off completely because I can avoid the staff.

There was a geometric shape table knick knack I thought was modern cool, but the sticker of $70 for a damn thing made out of thin metal rods is ridiculous. \n\nThis is the spot though for painting supplies as their prices are better than most shops, for beads, for silk florals and if youre into all those signs with quotes and words, they are everywhere in the store.",2

One of my favorite lunch deals (I learned from Ms. Faith D) is the $5 soup, half wrap and chip deal. Deeeeeelish. If you're feelin' the Italian, you can also score a piece of 'za in place of the half wrap to round out that $5 lunch special, too. \n\nThe staff here are always really friendly and helpful, which makes for a very pleasant lunch experience.

review_476943,shopping,"I absolutely HATE this Walmart!!!!   The only reason that I come here is to try to pick up an item here or there since it's on my way home from work.  However, several times I've come out empty handed because they are miraculously sold out of what ever I wanted.   The management here is horrible since they can't seem to keep their shelves properly stocked.  Who is in charge of ordering?   It all boils down to the manager not running a tight ship.  If this only happened occasionally, it would be one thing, but every time that I'm there?  Also, the service desk needs additional help. One time when I went to pick up an online \""ship to store\"" item, just one clerk was working the returns desk - and he had a line.   He told me to go to the photo area and someone would be there. So after waiting and waiting - I checked the print-out of my order confirmation, got the store phone number, and CALLED the mgr from my cell phone - having seen his picture & name on a plaque on the wall.    Lucky for him, a clerk finally showed up before he answered.  I will go to the store in Indian Trail, NC (1'st choice) or the Arboretum at Pineville-Matthews & Providence Rds. (2'nd choice.) They seem to be managed much better, and rarely do they not have what I'm looking for.  Enter this Walmart at your own risk - but understand that you have a big chance that whatever you went for is out of stock.

review_356473,shopping,"I think the 3 star sort of summarises this shopping centre/food court/tourist attraction. It's pretty average.\n\nThey have some brilliant shops down here - Topshop, French Connection and Warehouse, but the whole place just feels so sad. There is no atmosphere and there is no sense of enjoyment. On paper, Ocean Terminal should be a tourist paradise and attract heaps of Edinburgh locals but in reality it just isn't doing it!! They have a VUE cinema here which is brilliant, I've been a few times because it's always really quiet and there's free parking (woohoo!) so it's a winner all round. The food courts aren't brilliant, there is a nice view of the docks from some of them, but I definitely wouldn't go out of my way to come here.\n\nSaying that, the John Lewis and other shops are worth visiting if you have a purpose. As I said, the free parking is its main selling point!",2

The meat section is very clean , I don't usually buy marinated meat but it looked so good and fresh , I thought it would go with the fresh tortillas , salsa and guacamole we had in the cart . They also have a cheese counter with all kinds of Mexico 's finest. They even had fresh made rice pudding they sell by the lb.  The bakery was impressive, everything looked so good .

As I browsed, one of the employees let me know that there are taster bottles throughout the shelves which you can take a little sample out of and taste it. And if you still have a little bit in your hand, they said it's fine to just drop it on the floor. Which probably why it smells so great inside.\n\nI went to Savory Spice Shop with the intention of just getting cardamom and saffron but ended up buying other things too. Besides the obvious herbs and spices, they also have gourmet food items from local artisans, teas, unique spice blends, books, mortars and pestles, cedar planks for grilling, spice racks, and salt blocks.\n\nI really can't wait to go back again and just admire all the wonderful things this store has to offer.",4

Ok, sure, just a brief visit. \n\nChezelle's cute cocktail dresses and silk tops just beckoned me to stop in, so I did! This well-appointed boutique is nestled in the Shops at Morrison, providing some neighborly love to Charlotte big hitters like Scout & Molly's, Capitol and Earthfare. When I walked in I was greeted by a large tabled filled with stunning accessories - rings, bracelets, necklace, cuffs, you name it - they had it. I was even happier to find out that most of these accessories were fairly affordable! I would venture to say that a fair amount of their costume jewelry fell into the $30-$75 price range.\n\nAs for their clothing, Chezelle lines up some great, unique designers that you won't necessarily find in other boutiques. I spied brands like Mara Hoffman, Lauren Moffat, Cynthia Steffe, Amanda Upchard, Cynthia Vincent and Rory Beca, just to name a few. While Chezelle seems to run sales fairly often, the non-sale retail price can squeeze your credit card: $100-$250 for tops and $150-$400 for cocktail dresses. Regardless, Chezelle has a myriad of beautiful clothing and jewelry that will satisfy a variety of tastes. I will note that I wasn't the biggest fan of the store layout, as I didn't quite know where to start. The clothes aren't organized by color or necessarily by style - but maybe it was the time of day when I dropped in.\n\nWhen I popped in here on a Saturday afternoon it was pretty busy and I didn't get much interaction from the staff, which was just fine by me. They were friendly when needed yet also gave me time to take in the store and check out the merchandise. I'll be back Chezelle!",3

There seemed to be more customers than vendors.\n\nWe were happy with what we did pick up, which was some ears of corn (already shucked & de-silked), strawberries, & peaches - all from different vendors.  We ate some today (Sunday) & everything was perfect - no imperfections whatsoever - as in no bruising, etc. with the peaches & strawberries.\n\nOther notes: plenty of parking, a greenery shed with trees & plants, a \""craft barn\"", & a few carnival/festival type vendors for a quick bite. They do have restrooms on site, but unfortunately, they had a very strong odor when you walk by them, so just be mindful of that. ;)\n\nI appreciate having this market here, especially when the prices are much cheaper than what you can find at the grocery store.",2

I asked to retake them and they said not now we are already going over our lunch break, But you can come back and pay for the seating fee again or wait till 4:30pm. Which would have been a 2hr wait.

review_68469,shopping,"Yay! I'm a fan.\n\nPersonally, I think BB&B is overpriced.  Unless you have one of their coupons, I struggle to find value here.  Yet that means one at a time purchases.  Still I cannot deny their quality and selection.  This time, I was after pillows.\n\nSo picked out the kind of pillow I wanted, but I couldn't find the style I wanted (back/stomach vs side sleeper).  I didn't see anyone I could ask wandering around, so I went up to the cashiers.  The young lady was probably one of the perkiest persons in customer service.  That interaction in and of itself brightened my day, but the result was that the pillow only came in one style.  She couldn't leave her post to help me, but promised to send someone who knew more than her anyway.\n\nNow for my second surprise in customer service.  Now when a young man shows up, I only expect a knowledgeable background if we are concerning ourselves with electronics, sports, cars, etc.  Definitely not pillows.  Well I don't mind being proven wrong especially in such a pleasant manner.  Turns out some time ago the store had some returned pillows due for disposal (I was also glad to hear used pillows don't make their way back into circulation).  Instead of just throwing them out into the trash, he did a little exploratory surgery.  He found out all the differences there were to correlate with price.  Add the fact he was more than happy to share, I was impressed.\n\nIt's almost a shame this team isn't running the place the whole time, but that just wouldn't be fair.  Even the manager was friendly and willing to (wo)man a register when needed.  This BB&B isn't even close to me; I only stumbled upon it after trying to avoid some highway congestion.

Although they really should clean their display products because they are oily and nasty!\n\nI like the customer service here. The employees will greet you when you walk in the store, but they won't bother you. I think they know that most people come into the store just to browse. If they see you testing out one of their products for a while, they will approach you and ask if you have any questions. I have only purchased something from here twice in the past.

review_245463,shopping,"Not a good experience here today! I went in to return some items and the woman helping me was somewhat rude and not helpful. Usually when I go in I'm in and out and have no issues. This woman was being very technical saying that the skew number on the receipt had to match the item exactly, even though it was the same item. For example, I returned a creme brulee set and the skew number on the receipt ended in 4686 but on the item it was 4687. She would not allow me to return the item even though it showed I bought a creme brulee set. I think she figured that I would just take the items back and not worry about the returns. In the long run it wound up making more work for herself because she had to do some of the returns over 2 or 3 times. Maybe she was mad because I had 8 different returns? I don't know. If you hate your job that much to where you take it out on customers then get a new job! It makes me mad because even though I was returning about $200 worth of merchandise I spend well over $1,000 there this holiday season. I could easily take my business to TJ Maxx or Marshalls. They charge a little more but at least I wouldn't have to deal with snippy little brats. \n\nAt the end of the transaction I thanked her and she ignored me and went onto helping the next customer. Sorry I made you do your job. \n\nI will say that this is probably a one off situation. Usually the people that work there are really nice. I wish they would permanently hire some of their holiday helpers because they were seriously the nicest and most helpful.",0

However, now that I've been a customer for a while I have to admit I'm disappointed. \n\nThe high points:\n1. Great selection of marinated meats - in particular the steak tips and Meathouse chicken is awesome and a lifesaver when you need something fast.\n2. Pasta and Provisions items - they stock a fair amount of stuff from Pasta and Provisions and it's a lot closer to home!\n3. Great selection of local condiments and sides.\n\nThe lows:\n1. Steadily declining customer service - when they first opened the service behind the counter was happy, attentive and accurate. Now, I barely can get their attention and twice in a row they've made substantial mistakes with my order (including one when I was entertaining family)! I feel like I'm inconveniencing them when I ask for something!\n2. Price - while they were never inexpensive, I feel that meathouse is overcharging for what they offer. There are now other butchers in town that offer locally sourced beef and chicken at a fraction of the price. \n\nOverall I wish Meathouse success but I won't be a customer - at those prices I expect better customer service.",1

Today was the first time I actually went into a fitting room though and the first thing I noticed was how spacious each room was. There are three mirrors, a bench, a little stool, and about 3 hooks to hang your clothes on. I don't really care about fitting rooms that much, but I definitely remember which places have the best ones and this is probably one of the top because of the size. The team members at the fitting room desk are also very helpful and friendly. As I was trying on my clothes I could hear them talking to customers and answering phones. They were very polite, accommodating, and courteous. \n\nEvery time I've gone to this Target location, I've never had to wait more than two minutes in line.

The walls are lined with the type of foods your local supermarket just doesn't sell. \n\nMy reason for going was because I heard they had a good selection of American goods. I could hear the Peanut Butter M&Ms calling my name! So firstly they do your standard imported American goods- Aunt Bessies Pancake mix/syrup, variety of Betty Crocker cake mixes, chocolate bars, sodas (not Mountain Dew), Fluff etc. \n\nBut the more exciting part of the shop is the huge selection of spices, chillies, salsas and hot sauces. There is also a good selection of chorizo which rather excited me. This shop would take care of any spice needs you had for any cuisine as it seemed to cover everything from Mexican to Asian spices.  I admired the salsas and hot sauces for a good while before deciding I was too poor to buy anything. Unfortunately as the items are imported, they are quite expensive.

Somehow, the atmosphere on the particular afternoon I visited stressed me out.  A family with two screaming kids, spilling things on the floor.  The employees appeared to be squabbling over something or other and loudly calling out ingredients that they needed.  The layout is also a bit confusing with menus on one end, payment on the other that was opposite to guest traffic.  The staff on this day was a bit surly.\n\nI did like the open, industrial vibe with writing on the walls and a variety of news magazine covers on the walls.\n\nThe lunch bagels have fun names and neat meat and veggie combinations.  I had a turkey, avocado, bacon and cheese bagel.  Steamed bagels are a strange concept for me.  I'm not a fan.  Bagels packed To Go will steam on their own in the wrapper, so why steam them to start?  All in all, I guess I like my bagels toasted and to eat them in a relaxing environment.
