review_602656,restaurant,"Kind of ricey even though we didn't order AYCE but they tasted good and fresh. The toastedness of the sasa wasnt my favorite but tge playboy was good. \n\nAaron was great, I think he's the manager.  Good, fast service.",3

review_553423,restaurant,Traditional chain restuarant with your typical menu.  Great location though.....and it was hopping for its grand opening.,1
review_649036,restaurant,"Two words come to mind that best describe my experience: thoroughly disappointing. The ambience is great - the decor is good and the waitstaff were nice enough. If I could end the review there this would be a 5 star review... but oh, the food. \n\nI ordered a staple, Pad Thai. I'm not sure where they went wrong but it was terrible all around. Instead of choosing your protein (as is common with the dish), this chef is confused - they include chicken, shrimp, and something else I couldn't quite make out; the flavor was just 'off' from what Pad Thai should be - that's as best as I can describe it. The spice level also left much to be desired - I ordered 'Thai Hot', the spiciest they have and the dish packed as much punch as a wet noodle, no pun intended. Lastly, the consistency of the noodles was just wrong - either it was too soggy or too wet and the noodles were round instead of flat so it didn't feel quite right in the mouth. \n\nAnd the price? At $14.95, this was the most expensive Pad Thai I've ever had; I wish I could say it was worth it. \n\nOn our way out (based on what I could see), I noticed that they didn't have a single Asian/Thailander working in the kitchen - it just seemed like a bunch of Southerners trying to mimic Asian cuisine; maybe that's why the food didn't have an 'authentic' taste. Maybe I'm being way too harsh/overly critical, but I'll tell you this - this is the first review I've ever given less than 4 stars; that's saying something. \n\nI really wanted to love this place, I did (especially since we live across the street from it), but based on tonight's performance, they're going to have a really hard time winning me back. \n\nOh and did I mention they don't have a lunch service? A Thai place with no lunch - that's like McDonald's with no breakfast.",1
review_643930,restaurant,"I always managed to feel sick after eating here, so I stopped going except for happy hour after work and maybe fries to eat.\n\nService varies. We had great service at first, and then it went downhill and we stopped going so much.  I might try another location, but it's not likely.",2
review_459769,restaurant,"I would give 2 stars but the food is good. Service is terrible slow. Went on a Saturday night took 15-20 minutes to get our beer.  Our server forgot to put in our appetizer and it came just before our meal. The mgr did comp it for us, but still, was surprised the server never checked in with us.  They brought my husbands meal from the kitchen 20 mins prior to our rolls being served, his meal was cold by the time we ate.  He ordered a second beer and they advised him they only had warm glasses and asked of that would be ok.... I come back because the food is good, but the service needs some help!",2
review_509241,restaurant,"Me and my girlfriend walked into this place after Mary Anns diner was full from Unofficial weekend. The chips where not bad, but when i took the first bite after dipping it in the salsa my perception of this place completely changed. The salsa tasted like it was from a can. \n\nThe service was not bad but i think the waiter suspected we were not enjoying our meal. Everything tasted like it was microwaved and on top of that the food was already bad. If i wanted beef tacos, tomato sauce enchiladas, and flavorless rice I would have gone down the street and ate at taco bell for half the price. \n\nTo sum things up, if you want authentic Mexican food, DO NOT GO HERE!",0
review_549211,restaurant,"My boyfriend and I tried this place a week ago.  I loved the theme of the place, since I come from the Northwoods myself.  That was the best part about the place, unfortunately.\n\nThe restaurant was not very full, but service took FOREVER.  The menu was overly large and the prices were overly inflated (especially considering the poor quality of the food).\n\nWe were seated pretty quickly, but it took the waitress a long time to actually visit us.  And then it took another very long time before she came back with our beverages.  And refills took just as long.  Very poor service.\n\nWhen she laid out the menus, the waitress went over the specials.  Seeing that they serve Country Fried Steak, I said it was a shame that they dont serve chicken fried chicken.  The waitress immediately corrected me, and insisted they DO, tapping emphatically on the Country Fried Steak item.  I asked her three times to clarify that what she was pointing at was not chicken, and she kept insisting, \""Yes, it SAYS steak, but this is actually chicken!!!\""  We should have walked out right then, ....buuuuut we didnt.  She finally realized what she was saying and admitted that the Country Fried Steak was not actually chicken, but beef, and that they do not serve chicken fried chicken.  Ugh.\n\nSo, I ordered the breakfast special that day, which amounted to ham steak, hashbrowns, sourdough toast and scrambled eggs with cheese.  My boyfriend ordered a big burger.\n\nWe waited for at least 30 minutes from the time of our order to the time that our food arrived at our table.  The burger arrived cooked as ordered, and my boyfriend ate it, saying it was 'good'.  My breakfast was awful.  The presentation was ugly, because I was expecting to get an entire ham steak, but what I received was a badly cut, fatty partial piece of a ham steak which was cold when it got to the table.  The hash browns were oily, and nothing to write home about.  My sourdough toast was actually burnt to the point of being black and charred across the surface.  The eggs were hot though, and fairly good tasting.  Not worth the price we paid, or the use of the lumberjack name.  \n\nI was physically sick from shortly after we ate, for the rest of that day, and we will not be going back again.  I would suggest that you AVOID this place like the plague, and go to IHOP, or Denny's, or basically any other greasy spoon diner because the price you pay will be far less, and the food will be far better.  Heck, Arizona Charlie's serves the same meal I ordered, but you get an entire ham steak, completely free of fatty bits, for $3.99, their service is prompt, and the waitstaff knows what they do and do not have on their menu.",0
review_122936,restaurant,"Seeked this place out looking for a sit down, but off the path mexi place.  My wife had a whole fried fish (mojarra) and said it was outstanding.  She thought it could have been cooked a touch more, but that indicates to me that they did it just right.\nKids had carne asada tacos plain, no toppings at their request.  They wolfed them down.\nI had two cheese enchiladas topped with their mole sauce.  It was very good.  Service was polite, sincere and prompt.  I would go back in a heatbeat.  After looking at the bill I was even more enthusiastic about this place.  Great job!\n\nWorthy note:  Besides their delicious salsas, they had my wife's favorite bottled hot sauce on tap (Castillos).  That is a first!\n\nStacky Best Of Award\u2122  Mojarra",3
review_235200,restaurant,"Awesome. Actually, half of the owner team is Guatemalan. They also own Milo's in bufu, Urbana but as Escobar is the chef, Escobar's is his place.\n\nI always have a good time with their wine staff, especially the lovely salty gal that has only been tending a short while but swigs wine like a sailor, which is to say she doesn't take a dainty white-glove approach. She's a no-nonsense, straight-up pro that can take in a mouthful of wine and nail the flavor notes without all the swirling and sniffing and sloshing. It's the only time I've been able to say, \""this one tastes like a chewy, sweaty S&M jock strap\"" and have someone know exactly what I mean without further explanation. And despite the fact that she's a beer girl, her vino recommendations (granted the list is not as extensive as other places downtown) are excellent.\n\nI've done a few different things on the menu but I always go back to their duck a l'orange. The meat is always cooked to succulent perfection and maybe it's because everything on the plate is a shade of orange but the entire dish tastes juicy, earthy, bright and warm. Like 6pm sunshine! Like it's made from Care Bears! I want to liquify it, put it in an IV and jack the whole tasty lot right into my veins!\n\nThe mussels are excellent as well and my friend scarfed the ceviche on our last visit (I had my face in the mussels - so much for sharing).\n\nThe bread is baked in house and they have a bombin' spicy corn focaccia so it's easy to load up on table bread guilt-free because you can't nosh on Escobar bread anywhere else but Escobar's.\n\nMost importantly I like this place because the food is so good and the staff is so nice that it doesn't need all the flash and glam of other restaurants to earn five stars on yelp! The closest comparison I have is the cluster of restaurants out in Napa: sun-drenched, family-owned, friendly and in an epic love affair with food. Outdoor seating means gazing into a parking lot as cars zoom by but it is still the only place in Champaign where I am a little saddened at the end of my meal because I don't have four stomachs, four wads of cash and four hours to sit and eat four more servings of Escobar's duck a l'orange.",4
review_502512,restaurant,"Outstanding food.  I placed a small to go order and I showed up 20 mins later to find that I was not ready.  The women there are very nice.  They recently hired some white guy that is a complete douche and needs to fired that runs the register.  that ass hat was just standing there sizing me up the whole time I was waiting.  I thought I was going to have to throw down in the thai restaurant!  Anyways, the dude was unpleasant, rude, and just put me off to the whole place and unfortunately I will not be returning.  Wahoos next door is excellent though :)",1
review_569672,restaurant,"This place is pretty cool, not sure about the food.  When we got there it was not even 6pm and our server told us they were out of Spud Tacos and he would let us know how long before they made more.  We got a flight of beers.  I only liked 2 of the six he selected.  I am not a beer drinker, I like them light and not too hoppy or lemony.  After about 20 minutes we saw another server and asked her to inquire how long before the Spud Tacos were available again.  She came back and said 45 minutes, wow.  How long does it take to cook sweet potatoes in their kitchen?  We were not going to wait for them and we were glad because I read the review on the New Times about an hour later and it was not glowing.  I think this place has potential.  It is a little bit too noisy, I think they should consider putting some noise absorbing tiles.",2
review_396014,restaurant,"The server was terrible here.  She got the orders all wrong, try to save us money by including my meal with someone elses when that person clearly wanted all four of the things in the deal he was getting. Clean location, but bad service.",2
review_480483,restaurant,"I remember seeing the Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives that featured Los Taquitos, but never got the urge to drive all the way down to Ahwatukee to try it out, so when the sign went up in the center near my office I was excited!\n\nThe interior is really modern and they have a huge bar, which from what I hear, is very different from the original location, but they are trying to step it up a notch!  You still order at the counter and get a number, which I love, and take out doesn't take that long either.\n\nI have tried the chicken quesadilla and the carne asada quesadilla and loved them both.  The green salsa goes great with the chicken quesadilla, which was a helpful tip from one of the owners.  One of the best parts of the quesadilla experience here is that it is not greasy at all!  They use a white cheese (jack I think) and use just enough to make it cheesy without overwhelming it with grease, plus they cut them up in cute little squares that makes it great for sharing.  They also have good guacamole.\n\nThe only downside so far is the beans....they are a bit on the runny side....but with so many other options at reasonable prices...I guess I can overlook this!",3
review_189440,restaurant,"What in the world?! How does this place have such positive reviews???? \n\nStaff - SLOW, slow, slow. Other than slow, they looked miserable - I almost felt bad for them.\n\nFood - When walking into a buffet there should be So many items that stick out that Im overwhelmed and can't decide. This was not the case - I actually had a hard time deciding this time because nothing was appealing.  - the only thing that I was slightly excited about was the fried chicken - which btw was also disappointing. It was greasy and flavorless. The lamb was another item that was bad - it was extremely overcooked - dry and jerkylike. I even had a hard time trying to cut it into pieces. I should not be struggling this much. Crablegs were sad - hardly any meat and icy cold. Desserts - not good. The crepes were so sad. The blueberry parfait had the worst texture. Upon first bite, I wanted to throw up.\n\nIn the end, I left the buffet hungry and unsatisifed. This should never be the case when I'm at a buffet.",0
review_604703,restaurant,"The Greek gentleman would not sell me what I wanted. I just wanted to try a leg and thigh before trying an 8 piece. He told  me no repeatedly. \""You must buy 8 piece or dinner.\"" But I didn't want any coleslaw or fries! Just chicken. KFC and Popeye's will let me buy one piece. Is it that hard to price out one piece of chicken? Honestly, I want to know why an owner would not accommodate a potential life long customer! Is this normal business practice? Please someone tell me.\nSanitation rating = 97. Not sure how they got that, cuz the place looked NASTY!!!",0
review_400610,restaurant,"I lived in Los Angeles for 22 years and Dallas for 20 years and have traveled extensively in Mexico, so I consider myself a good judge of GOOD Mexican food.\nWell, Unfortunately I didn't find it at Concina Mendoza. In fact, it serves the worst Mexican food I've ever had. I started out with a beef chile relleno\n and it was awful.\nThe breading on the chile was soggy and bathed in some sort of soupy sauce.\nThe waitress took it back and I was hesitant to order a replacement but went with the simple ground beef burrito thinking how could they mess up a burrito. Well, they did.\nI don't know what the meat was inside but it sure didn't taste like beef. I had 2 bites\nand asked for the check. And by the way, they have a huge sign on the window offering Margaritas for $3.25. When my bill came, they were $5.99. When I questioned why $5.99? the waitress said the $3.25 price was Mon-Thu. Upon leaving I did check the sign and in very small print it does say Mon-Thu but you need a magnifying glass to read it. Taco Bell has far superior food to this place. Don't waste your money here.\nI spent $22.00 with tip for a margarita, some chips & salsa and 2 bites of a burrito.\nI'll never eat here again and will make sure my friends & family don't either.",0
review_189724,restaurant,"We made it to Brunch and the line was ridiculous!! But I had already come to accept that Vegas was just code for lines everywhere. Anywho..\n\nThe food was good. I wish there was a little more of a selection in each cuisine, but I was spoiled by going to the Bacchanal a few days earlier..and this was also Brunch sooo maybe that's why. Their BBQ pork buns in the Asian section were so tasty!! I also tried some kind of beef, I don't know, the cook was hard to hear. But it was juicy and delicious!\n\nMy bf and I were lucky enough to get seating out in the garden room area with all the pretty flowers. The service was pretty good. \n\nOverall, it was a nice brunch and we did stuff our faces. I wouldn't eat that candied apple though, unless you were looking to break some teeth! :P",3
review_310284,restaurant,"First and last time I'll do business with them. \n\nThe pizza I ordered was barely warm, but I was hungry so I threw a few slices in the microwave. When I called to complain, I was put on hold for several minutes and told that the deliveryman had seen it come out of the oven with his own eyes.\nThis didn't change the fact, I told them, that it wasn't hot and, in fact, the cheese wasn't melted at all.\nLater that night, I got the bad news that something else was wrong - I had food poisoning. When I told them yesterday what had happened, they were something less than sympathetic.\n\nIf you value your health, stay away from Lucci's Pizza and Pasta.",0
review_444732,restaurant,"The food was delicious, but they had us waiting 40 minutes after ordering for our food to arrive. When it arrived the server explained that they just finished serving a table of 40 in the back. Why couldn't they tell me when I arrived? Give the patron the choice if we want to wait or not, they knew the wait would be that long.",2
review_339398,restaurant,"This place is a throw back to another time. An ugly time from the 70's and 80's. They haven't changed, but they should. I've often felt like I'm in a prison cafeteria waiting for my portion of food. And if you've been here late enough you even feel like you might have to fight to keep your food!",1
review_99578,restaurant,"Horrible service!!! I had to WAIT...when there only were two people ahead of me. Got my food, went home and was shorted 2 items. I called & the guy said he could give me 2 extra biscuits and a family size okra. REALLY??? for wasting my time and gasoline. REALLY??? I did go back the next day and...WAITED & WAITED. This is the crappiest service ever! I occasionally enjoy the food but I will definitely check my order before I leave, IF I go back to that location. These employees have no sense of priority, BIG PERIOD.",1
review_272993,restaurant,"I ordered a spinach, goat cheese and sundried tomatoe omelet. It was horrible! The cheese was not inside, but on top - cold and unmelted. The omelet was actually more of a fritatta as it was brown all over from being overcooked. I mentioned this to the employee who brought the dish to my table, but my complaint went ignored. Even after eating only one bite of the omelet - it was cold on top of everything else - no one seemed to care. After spending $13 for an omelet and glass of milk, you'd think they'd jump through hoops to make people happy given their prices. Never again. This was my second visit and I was unhappy after my first. Hoping the first visit was a fluke, I gave this restaurant a second chance. Big mistake on my part.\n\nThe employees were very friendly when I ordered, but this isn't enough to make up for the lack of concern  or care over my displeasure. The food is not good and the prices are way too high for what you get.",0
review_158786,restaurant,"Oh man ... this is NOT good pizza ... it's CHEAP and they usually have an all you can eat lunch buffet but the 'za is about as good as Little Caesar's Pizza (i.e. \""not so much\"")",0
review_298034,restaurant,"We purchased the full day buffet special for $32 because we though it would be amazing food at a great price. While it was a good deal, the food was disappointingly average. The lunch and dinner menu were the exact same two days in a row, which got boring really fast.  Lastly, there was a Mexican section [enchiladas, beans, rice...], a Chinese, section [orange chicken, rice, egg rolls...], and an Italian section [spaghetti, meatballs...] with food that looked and tasted like something from Denny's. I recommend you only eat at the buffet once, probably breakfast.\n\nAlso, the dessert buffet was alright; apple pie, frozen yogurt, cheesecake, brownie bites, mousse pie, stuff bought from the store. This buffet is one step above the buffet at the  \""Exacalibur,\"" ...and that isn't saying much.",1
review_402358,restaurant,"So happy with our decision to come here this evening. Sushi in Maricopa made me a bit skeptical, but the food and service were amazing!! Strongly suggest the monkey balls.",3
review_38648,restaurant,"The best sashimi in the valley.  I like the relaxed atmosphere here and not feel rushed to complete my meal.  Best make reservations if you plan on a weekend night out.  Better yet, get there when they open and enjoy happy hour beer pricing.",4
review_319418,restaurant,I ordered on Xmas Eve pizza and wings.  Order was supposed to be delivered at 7:12PM.  I got a call at 7:15PM telling me they didn't prep enough pizza dough and and couldn't fill my order.  The giggling girl on the call was rude and seemed not to care.  \n  They knew when they got my order they couldn't fill it.  They should not have accepted the order.  I see now why Pizza Hut is in such financial trouble.  Bah humbug Pizza Scrooge .   My New Years Resolution is Dominos Pizza!,0
review_317208,restaurant,"One of the best burgers I had in my life. The list of toppings you can add is more than I have ever seen. I had grilled onion rings, tomato, coleslaw, pickles, mayo and mustard on my burger. You can also create your own milkshake and your own salad. So glad my buddy turned me on to this place. Love the old diner feel. The wait for the food to be prepared was a bit too long in my opinion.",3
review_205955,restaurant,"Minus one star ....when you make reservations and specify BALCONY.....you better get balcony! Well, after 20min of waiting for our balcony table, and a stern chat with the GM, we had comped drinks and our table.....but really? If I request something.....just give it to me.....or I'll complain until you do.....",2
review_89402,restaurant,"I picked this place because I thought it would be good for a group setting. The people I traveled with had different dietary restrictions and I like to make sure I can cater to them all. This place worked, but the food was standard. I definitely wasn't expecting mind blowing food, but when it comes to a cafe I'd like the food to be comforting. \n\nMy burger reminded me of a day at the park where you buy frozen burger patties from Costco and throw em on the grill. Where's In-and-Out when I need them? They also wouldn't cook my french fries extra crispy for some reason which was also another negative. The highlight was probably the hot fudge sundae but as a reminder, unless you like eating dessert as dinner, share that sucker with someone. \n\nI'd go here again if I wanted something super casual and laid back. But since I usually travel here with a band wagon of people, I'll have to take them elsewhere.",2
review_626504,restaurant,"In spite of the fact that I wrote a scathing review of Viva Mercado's shortly after their reopening in their newest location, I'm revising because Bobby has made sure that positive changes were made.  \n\nThe food has greatly improved since my early 2014 review. It's just like I remember it if not better, and I'm back to ordering on a regular basis again. \n\nI'm glad I didn't give up on them because they do listen to their customers' concerns and I thank them for that.",4
review_158992,restaurant,"Ive never been a fan of this place but some friends were going there and invited us to come with them.. what the hell, right?\n\nThe service is pretty good here.. very attentive and friendly. Ordered the spinach salad, the dressing was really weird, like a miso dressing with bacon.. didn't work at all. Also ordered a Frisco pizza, thin crust. Well the outer perimeter of the pizza was so dried out that those pieces were just about inedible. Maybe that's how they do it here? I don't remember the pizza's being that dry? The wings were good enough.. plenty of meat and not greasy at all. \n\nI wouldn't go come back to Oregano's unless some friends were going and I was invited. You would have been proud of me, I didn't complain at all!!",1
review_479575,restaurant,"I love this place. Not your typical breakfast. You have to go in knowing that you may or may not get a seat, you will probably wait in line, but the waffles are amazing. I don't do coffee, but the hot chocolate and a naked waffle on a cold morning sure hits the spot.",4
review_82994,restaurant,"Every aspect of our breakfast at Dino's was phenomenal. As some other reviews have mentioned, the staff were incredibly kind, warm, and attentive. The waitress for our table was vigilante about refilling coffee and water cups, and she gave us four extra halves of fresh buttered toast on the house!\n\nThe food came out incredibly quickly. And every single thing was incredibly delicious. The one item that stood out above the rest was the biscuit gravy. If you have a meal here you should seriously consider incorporating the gravy into your meal somehow, it was phenomenal.\n\nLastly, the menu is reasonably priced, arguably cheap. I paid $9 before tip for two eggs, two pork chops, hash browns and toast. I think the biscuit with gravy (generous portion) was around $2, not positive though.",4
review_97598,restaurant,"I don't understand why everyone likes this place so much. This place is called burrito express and we had to wait like 20 minutes to get our food, with no one in front of us. I got the steak and salsa burrito my fiance got the machaca burrito. His was like 3 times the sizes of mine and my cheese wasn't even melted. My burrito wasn't terrible but it wasn't good. My fiance's burrito was so disgustingly greasy he couldn't even finish it and he loves greasy food, we wouldn't even want to give it to our dog. It looked disgusting! He just threw the other half away and felt sick the rest of the day. We ordered some chips and salsa and they threw a couple table spooned size salsa containers in the bag, which wasn't enough for the chips. We asked for more and they charged us extra for each salsa! The salsa tasted terrible! They also charge you extra for using a credit card. I wouldn't go back.",1
review_469004,restaurant,"I have visited this establishment more times than I can count, but never by choice. Birthdays, farewell parties, and casual get-togethers. I groaned every time as I prepared myself to go. I'll explain - nothing I've eaten has impressed me in any way. The nachos are okay (essentially, I've had better and cheaper!); the fried clams, quesadillas, fries, etc. all just merit a \""meh\"" from me (although, the hand rolled stuffed jalapenos were pretty good). HOWEVER, the reason I gave it three stars is because I finally tried their \""world famous\"" wings/zingers on my most recent trip and WOW - delicious!! Crispy with great flavor, not to mention their great sauces (that you can also combine, thus the possibilities are endless; I mixed 'medium' with 'BBQ' that evening) that you just want to lick off your fingers! It definitely threw me for a loop that a place I thought I'd sworn off is the same place I want to revisit for unforgettable wings.",2
review_395255,restaurant,"The mango curry with chicken is VERY TASTY, however not the most complex curry flavor I have ever experienced.  However it also had very little mango flavor, and the predominant flavor was certainly from the acorn squash, and a little from the pineapple.  Ordered it as \""medium\"" spicy, and in my opinion it was not spicy at all, not even a little heat.  Will order it as \""hot\"" next time.  Got takeout on a friday night and I am very glad we did because the restaurant was so packed I had trouble even spotting the counter through the mass of people standing  by the door waiting for  a table. Very affordable too, my curry was only $10 and was huge :)",3
review_234388,restaurant,"Good food, reasonable $$$$, and more important a good staff and mgmt.    we go almost on a weekly basis, and we always get a wave from the mgr and other servers.  Very friendly place.  Good margaritas!!!!!!",3
review_228682,restaurant,"Nice place for a quick bite to eat or a nice dinner, nice area to grab a drink and meet up with friends.  The atmosphere is a little more grown up than the strip, pretty and relaxing overall. Clean and doesn't smell all smoky like some of the other casinos.",3
review_625848,restaurant,"I've tried this restaurant a few times with friends and it is so disappointing every time. I'm no longer interested in giving them a shot. The food is sub-par at best and the prices are too high. \n\nCase in point, I ordered pancakes and I don't know how it's possible to mess up a pancake, but they were able to do just that. Who serves a pancake with cayenne pepper all over it and doesn't warn a customer who orders it?! Food allergies, anyone?! That's just not smart. It was beyond gross as well. They never even offered to replace the pancakes or bring anything else as a substitute. When I asked for a small biscuit, they told me, \""they wouldn't charge me this time.\"" Is that a threat?! Please.... Go back to Asheville. You can keep this place. I'm not sure Charlotte wants to embrace you and I can tell you that I surely won't.",0
review_279910,restaurant,"Don't waste your time going here!!!\n\nI came in for late lunch around 3pm and stood in the doorway for almost 10 minutes till I was greeted.  Three servers were too busy standing around doing nothing by the food window but gossip than to acknowledge, greet, and seat me.\n\nAfter I finally got a table, the server I had was fine...she seemed busy with other tables and since I was alone, I guess I was not a priority.  I finally placed my order after waiting what seemed like forever.\n\nPlease be advised, if you order a burger, you can ONLY get them cooked well done!!!!  The server said it was a restaurant rule!  I tried a Burogi ( a burger with 2 Pierogis on top of it), and although it had decent flavor, it would have been better if not cooked well done.  \n\nShe dropped my check only after I had to flag her down and ask her for it.  I had to get to the river cruise that was next door.\n\nI should have just gone to one of the chain restaurants that was in Station Square, but wanted to try a Pittsburgh place.  If you want bad service and overcooked burgers, than this is the place to go!!!!",1

review_2248,restaurant,"It was raining and we were in the Strip district craving some seafood.  We decided to stop by Roland's Seafood Grill.\n\nWe were seated right away close to the bar in front of the big screen projector where the US open was playing.

We were glad for the US Open entertainment.\n\nMy dad order the clam chowder soup, which was chunky and bare of any clams.

If you are caught in the rain and do not have any other choices in the strip area, stop by.  I would recommend scoping out the other restaurants in the area.",1
review_345227,restaurant,"Last week, I drove by Villa Francesca, I said out loud, \"" I want that restaurant to have great pizza by the slice.\""  I tried it tonight and it was outstanding.  A fresh pizza came out of the oven and I ordered a slice.  I sat outside on a bench and ate my pizza. It was a little thicker than \""thin\"" crust, topped with crushed tomatoes, fresh basil and mozzarella.    The owner came out and introduced himself and offered me another slice!!  It's good to be a girl!\nI don't think I want to eat pizza anywhere else in CLT.  My slice was $3.  The menu dinner items were $10-$15.  I can't wait to go back.  They are open on Sunday and outside seating.",4
review_634796,restaurant,I really like this place! The food is reasonably priced and very tasty. Their take on palak paneer is one of the better ones I've had. The staff is very friendly and really go above and beyond to make sure you are happy.,3

review_524822,restaurant,"It's food on the strip. When is food on the strip ever 5 star worthy? Never. \n\nI got the lobster grilled cheese with cajun fries. The lobster grilled cheese was pretty good for what it was but it wasn't amazing. Like everyone else said, I wish there was more lobster meat in it. 2 stars for that.\n\nAdded an additional 1 star for their cajun fries. The best cajun fries I've ever had. It was actually SPICY. I'd probably just only get their cajun fries next time as a snack and nothing else.",2

review_101678,restaurant,"You know how your wife or girlfriend is always whining about how you never listen to them? This of course as a shoe comes whistling past your cranium.\nWell The Tortilla Factory must have the same listening skills....their management never listens either.\n\nYou would think that after 111 reviews, someone over there would recognize there's a problem with the service. \nNope.\nThis would lead one to conclude no-one in management knows about Yelp, or, and I suspect this is more the case, they can't read,\n\nPrior to writing this, I read some of those 111 reviews in an effort to see how my experience last night paired-up.\nUncannily, it was true to form, explaining why this place gets two and a half stars.\n\nService was bad with waiters only stopping by to sell more drinks.\nHad to ask for the tortillas twice before ever seeing them..appx 20 minutes waiting on the free tortillas.\nHey TF, do I need to remind you of your namesake???\n\nAnd the prices for the amazingly tasteless food will stupefy you. (I sampled everyone's food in our party of eight) \n\nOld Town Tortilla Factory...you're really one sneaky bastard.\nLaying in wait....for all the unsuspecting Scottsdale visitors looking for the 'Mexican Food' experience, and instead ambushing them with your bad service, high prices and tasteless garbage you call food.\n\nBut you do have some nice attributes, which is why, similar to my situation of never listening, I still have a wife.\nOnly I'm not sure how a fountain, large patio and a cutesy margarita cup are going to keep you in business.\nOh well, who cares...right?\nThere'll be another plane full of visitors headed your way tomorrow. \n\nAre you related to Rustlers Roost by any chance? \nYou both have so much in common.",0
review_30648,restaurant,"I've been to this place many of times. The atmosphere is old and run down, the service is slow, coming from a server myself, and it takes forever for them to run credit cards. I have been over charged multiple times! The food though it always good! Save your money on alcohol though they can't makes drinks at all here. Stick to the beer.",1
review_352908,restaurant,"I wanted to give this a 3.5 star review, but alas I've opted to round down rather than up. The setting is very nice indeed and I can see that it would be equally well suited to a busy evening crowd as it was to our Sunday brunch gathering. The food looked good and they use tasty fresh ingredients - I had a full Scottish, though would have loved it to be a bit fuller with perhaps a second rasher or a little more toast.\n\nThere were a few touches that could have been overcome. I understand that they very rarely take reservations, so it was a surprise to hear that they couldn't add an extra table to our setting when the place was all but empty at the time. Nevertheless the staff were friendly and bright on a sunny morning, prompt with our orders and the bill, and quick with answers to our various questions. (Yes, you can opt for a fruit juice instead of the tea/coffee with the big breakfast.)\n\nHamilton's looks very Christmassy and is a lovely place to rest a while before a stroll round Stockbridge Market or the Water of Leith.",2
review_351837,restaurant,"Pretty mixed I'd say, had the green tea soba dish, it was pretty flavorful but the vegetables, snowpeas and green beans mostly, were waaaaay undercooked. With only a small amount of these really thin soba noodles, it was like chewing through hunks of wood, and too much cilantro, every so often you'd just chomp down on an entire sprig of it it seemed. Still tasted pretty good though, just needs some refining. \n\nThe juice drink I had was really interesting and I liked it quite a bit. It was agave and Ginger, which gave it a nice bite but was still very refreshing and light feeling.\n\nOverall it was not a bad experience, the atmosphere was nice (with the right company) and the wait-staff seemed helpful.  But for the price I would expect a little more concentration on their cooking not just the ingredients...",2

It you have ever had real Italian food or lived on the East Coast, you know better than to fall for those stupid commercials with the 12 Italian family members shouting across the table to one another while enjoying an Olive Garden meal.

review_587544,restaurant,"The one star in my review is for the quick smile and greeting we received immediately upon entering. After saying hello, the hostess asked if we had a reservation. \""Nope,\"" I replied, \""just wanted to stop in.\"" She then asked if we would prefer to sit at a table or the bar. \""A table would be great,\"" I said. \""Well,\"" responded the hostess, \""we're very busy tonight (which I totally got, I mean, the bar and the dining room were completely empty), so we do ask that you be respectful of that.\"" Excuse me??? \""I'm sorry, I don't understand?\"" I asked, looking for clarification. \""Oh, never mind. Would you prefer a table or a booth?\"" Umm, how about neither. Sorry lady, not so confident the food at this establishment will wash away that bad taste you just put in my mouth.

review_130690,restaurant,Nice experience if you can afford it. Wine $50 minimum. Dinner $200 plus for 4. A little disappointed as they placed us in a corner so we did not have a direct view of the fountains. Make sure to reserve that. Also go early as they had run out of fried calamari so we had to get the antipasto appetizer. It was ok. Had 3 pasta dishes- great homemade pasta.,2

review_635158,restaurant,Food was delivered wrong and cold. I know this place is new and is going to have growing pains but. ... Lots of employees wanting to seat you and no paper towels in bathroom and trash can full? ???? Staff tried to be nice but is obviously more interested in customers money than great service or food. After speaking to manager who said thank you for complaint but never offered apology. Seems customer relations training is in order. I have been to lots of Buffalo wild wings and this is not the top notch service that I am accustomed to. Also they need to keep in mind when hiring staff there are two bars with mediocre food and service within 1/4 mile with more attractive employees.,1
review_480027,restaurant,Ordered take out and everything was great. I had the sweet and sour pork which and chicken with garlic sauce. Both tasted amazing. I also got fried wantons and they threw in a free order of crab wantons. I did order soup but they forgot to put it in so I will check my order before I leave next time. Other than that everything is fresh and you could tell it was made to order. I will definitely go back. The building looked to be well clean and the last at the front desk was very nice.,3

review_491242,restaurant,"This review is going to cover both of my experiences at 'I Love Burgers'.\n\nThe first time was in January 2012. I am a bit of a burger fanatic, so when my buddy and I saw this restaurant while walking through the Palazzo, we had to stop and try it.\nMy first impression was that the dining area is too sterile and it was packed! But the true question was how are the burgers? They did not disappoint. We ordered the Fried Mac & Cheese Noms to start. They are VERY small, but the flavor was fantastic. On to the burgers!\nWe ordered three so we could cut them in half and try a variety. Caprese Burger, Wagyu Kobe Burger, and the Oregon Trail Burger. As well as Sweet Potato Fries.\nThe Caprese Burger was cooked perfectly, as were all the patties, however the balsamic reduction was a bit much. There was quite a bit on the burger and feel a little less would have added to it. Sometimes less is more. That was the case here. 2 star burger.\nThe Wagyu Kobe burger was good.... But not $25 good. The patty was juicy and flavorful but it didn't make my eyes roll back in my head like Kobe Beef should. The Truffle Cheese was a fantastic addition, after all, Truffle cheese is amazing all on it's own! I didn't care for the pretzel bun at all. 3 star burger.\nThe Oregon Trail burger was great! I make Bison Burgers on average of once a week at home. For those that haven't tried Bison, you are doing yourself an injustice. Bison is lower in Fat, lower in Cholesterol, Higher in Protein and in Minerals. Has an amazing sweet taste, and is so JUICY!!!!  Back to the burger.... We ordered it with caramelized  onions to soften them up and take the edge off a bit. The result was a spectacular burger. Juicy, perfectly cooked, flavorful, with a perfect amount of roasted garlic aioli. The Wheat bun was firm enough to hold the burger together, yet not so dense that it took away from the tender patty. 4+ star burger.\nSweet Potato Fries were great. Dusted with the perfect amount of cinnamon and brown sugar. \nSo, over all, the first visit deserved 3 1/2 stars. Being there are no half stars on yelp, let's call is 4 stars, as it was better than 'A-Ok'.\n\nThe second visit was last week. This time I knew what I wanted. I walked in around 5:30 pm. The place was DEAD! And it remained dead for the hour and a half that I was there.\nI sat down, placed my order of Mac & Cheese Noms, an Oregon Trail Burger with Caramelized Onions cooked medium rare, and Sweet Potato Fries.\nThe Noms came out pretty quick. They were as good as I remembered. Still a bit small, but, good nonetheless. Then came the fries and burger. Fries were luke warm at best. Some were even a bit soggy. It was bad. Just bad. However, the burger was worse. My previous experience of a perfectly cooked Medium-Rare burger was a memory. What I received was what appeared to be a juicy Buffalo Patty, but in reality was a dry piece of shoe leather. After my first bite, I cut into the burger to view a grey DRY overcooked $18 burger that my dog would have rejected. I squeezed the patty and not one drop of any type of liquid could be found. This was a first degree burger felony! \nFor the remainder of my stay at the Venetian, I stayed clear of 'I Love Burgers'. Granted this could be an isolated incident. But it was so bad that it wasn't worth taking the chance. This visit was not only zero stars, but, I would go so far as to give it multiple negative stars.\nThe WORST burger I have EVER had. And I've had some pretty bad ones.\nBecause of the good first experience, I have given it 2 stars. Otherwise it would be one star. I don't think I will ever give it a third shot.",1
review_641783,restaurant,I'm torn cause the good was as good as the one in Town Square but the service was mediocre at best.

review_630516,restaurant,"Went for lunch today with my wife. We both had the steak pitas. I had hummus and pita chips and she had the baked fries. \n\nFirst off, it was a bit confusing what you were supposed to do when you walked in. That was rectified by very courteous and helpful staff. It might help to have a small \""order here\"" sign. \n\nSecond, hummus is a side by itself?  Who orders just hummus?\n\nNow, for the food:\nReally like the idea of baked fries - it fits the theme just fine. The bad part is that is was not well executed - not very hot and not crispy at all. \n\nThe steak on both of our sandwiches and the salsa that my wife had on hers suffered from the same problem: no seasoning. The best word that I can come up with is bland. That certainly doesn't fit with an \""evolved\"" Greek menu. \n\nThe fresh made pita bread was very good and could be the foundation of some really good food - but it has to have some taste.",1
review_33935,restaurant,"I have been coming here for many years. The food have 99% of the time been so good. I usually do take out. Because of the language barrier they can seem a little rough around the edges. I am rating strictly on my experience today with take out. The food was excellent, the service was ridiculous. I walked in to get my food which was sitting there. There were 2 people at one table in the restaurant and no workers in site. After standing there a couple of minutes, I opened the door to see if it had a bell on it. Don't think so. But then in the far back corner with their back turned to me I see movement. A guy watching tv while he is eating. He took his sweet time and got up and headed to the front. Didn't say hi, just named my food and the dollar amount. I jokingly said you guys need a bell. He handed me my change and food and didn't respond and proceeded to leave the front desk before I even turned to leave. He didn't say thank you or nothing. As he walked away I said \""thank you\"" sarcastically. Seriously, how rude. I am so sorry I was interrupting his dinner... If I get customer service like this one more time, I will NEVER be back - yes good food or not - nothing aggravates me more than lazy bad customer service. This guy should not be allowed up at the front desk until he learns the urgency of a customer coming in and his manners.",0
review_173289,restaurant,"Awesome brunch. I have been here in the past for dinner and was not impressed, but brunch time... whoa! hola! \n\nMy favorite dish was the Chicken and waffles - roasted chicken, bacon and chive waffle,Tahitian vanilla bean butter, sauce chasseur. This wasn't even my dish and I kept reaching over to steal a bite. The chicken is sooo flavorful and tender. \n\nI ordered the Special which was scrambled eggs with wild shrimp, spinach, hollandaise sauce and brioche toast. Delish! the sauce was amazing and worked so well with the sweet little shrimps. \n\nProbably the best meal I had this vegas trip. \nI want more chicken and waffles!!! :P",4

review_216169,restaurant,"Jason and I love trying new places and really like when our friends and Twitter followers suggest new places for us to try. So far, we have been very lucky and a most of the suggestions have been awesome. The Oyster Bar at Palace Station was one of those great suggestions.\n\nBe prepared to wait in line, it is a small setup in the middle of the casino and can seat about 10 to 12 people. There is usually one cook behind the \""bar\"" and one additional server. There are no reservations but you will find a line. From what we hear, there is always a line and after our visit we understand why.\n\nWe had a chance to try a few things off their menu and cannot wait to try more on our next visit. The oysters and clams on the half shell are super fresh and shucked to order right in front of you. Their clam chowder is solid, very creamy and hearty. The main courses were unreal. We had the Palace Shrimp Pan Roast and the \u00c9touff\u00e9e. Both had generous helpings of seafood with very distinctive flavors, and can be ordered at the heat level that best suits you. We ordered a six on the heat level, which can go as high as 10. We like hot and this was almost perfect but I think we will do a 7 the next time. But be careful, the heat level is serious.\n\nThe service was really good, more relaxing than I expected. The cook kept us entertained while he prepared our entrees. If you head to Las Vegas, make sure you check this place out.",4

There's always about a 20 minute wait and sometimes the salad bar can get crowded.  \n\nRecommend taking a short drive away from the strip and check this place out.  It's a great place to take a date, but make sure you both bring your appetite.",4

review_341406,restaurant,"YUMMMMIEEEEEEE!!!! Make reservations early! This placed is packed everyday they are open.

The gravy was delicious the cheese curds, beyond expectation, the foie gras was seared to perfection. \n\nCrab Pie - Flaky and buttery pie crust filled with layers of scalloped potatoes, cream sauce, tons of stone crab meat, and topped with green salad. The combination was to DIE for. I wanted to finish everything but could not manage. The portion size astronomical. \n\nSteak Frites - If you like Bison, you will enjoy this dish. Cooked rare with mushrooms and onions in a wine reduction. The main dish also comes with a tall cone of frites. \n\nButter Cake Pudding - This dessert was a bit too sweet and buttery for our taste. We may have enjoyed it more if we actually had room for dessert. \n\nOver all I would highly recommend this place to anyone in the mood for fantastic, no fuss french contemporary cuisine.",3
review_164811,restaurant,"the rating and the following was based on my experience in 2009.  i heard the menu has since changed, and the meals i had are no longer on the menu.  bummer.\n\n********************************************\nI've been to Palm more than a few times, and i was never disappointed!\n\nI had their club member special, which includes a salad, half and half of cottage fries and onion rings, and an order of their Filet Mignon Oscar style.\n\nThe salad was pretty standard, mixed greens tosses with light vinegrette.  It definitely went great with their assorted bread basket, which has a white chocolate bread that I've never had anywhere else!  I'd go back just for that bread!\n\nFor those of you who don't know what cottage fries are, they're basically hot-off-da-fryer-fresh thick cut potato chips.  The serving is huge!  The plate was piled high with them fries, then topped off with another pile of  strings of thinly battered and fried sweet onion that has a perfect balance of crunchiness and sweetness.  I'd go back just for them fries and rings too!\n\nOscar style Filet Mignon, where do I start!

review_36740,restaurant,"The place really is a gem.. Outside patio, great chips good salsa and they have a deal that if you join their club and sample all their tequilas you get a cartoon caricature with your name painted on a wall inside the bar. Food is usually good (but inconsistent), service during the summer was awesome. Service during the winter is obviously not as good. Always clean, nice fresh atmosphere and reasonable prices. Separate restaurant area from the bar for family dinning and the patio always works on mild days. I hope they can regroup in the kitchen and get the servers trained so they can get the consistency back on track. I rated them for their past not present conditions in the hope they will get it together. Oh and Elise was awesome as a waitress.",3
review_81972,restaurant,"Mmmm brunch. It's difficult to find a spot in Charlotte that will take reservations for Sunday brunch - but Providence Cafe welcomes them. This is mighty helpful as the church crowd positively takes over so many Charlotte eateries after 11 am...\n\nHubs and I met some friends for Sunday brunch and I was quite excited to try their fare, as Providence Cafe had just been featured in Charlotte magazine. From the outside, the cafe looks like an upscale eatery, with a stucco like (or just stucco) outside and parking on two sides of the building. It's a bit tucked away from the street, so make sure you look towards the back for extra parking. \n\nWe were seated promptly in the largest booth I've ever sat in. It could have easily sat eight people, therefore the four of us had plenty of space. Service was prompt and friendly - they let the four of us gab and only came over to refill our beverages and check on us just a few times. I was super excited to try their Oscar Omelette - an omelet stuffed with lump crab meat, cream cheese, asparagus and topped with Hollandaise. \n\nWhen the food arrived, the portions were nicely sized and the food looked fresh. My omelette was a bit disappointing, while the flavors were nice, there was too much Hollandaise and there was no texture difference in the omelette. Maybe more asparagus would have helped? But. the cream cheese and crab were just a bit too mushy for my liking. \n\nWhile the dish I chose wasn't my favorite breakfast item, I'd definitely like to go back and try something else on the menu. Their strawberry and almond french toast looked tasty.",2

review_604672,restaurant,"This place has an awesome vegetarian/vegan menu option!! My friends and I ordered veggie springs rolls for appetizers, then we ordered the red curry, pad thai, pad see eew, and Mongolian tofu for our entrees.  Everything was very tasty.  We ordered half of the dishes spicy ( red curry & pad thai)  and boy it was spicy!!  I can't really handle spicy so I ordered the Mongolian tofu and pad see eew with a spice level of 1.. ha.  All of this was $43!!!!!!  so the price is right!! LOL. \n\nThe service was good.  The waitress was very friendly and came back to check up on us.  She even refilled our water glasses without us having to ask.\n\nThe ambiance is not really there... but it doesn't matter too much to me.. just as long as the food is good.  I love that this restaurant caters to the vegan lifestyle.  The whole back of the menu is for vegetarians/vegans.  The front of the menu has all the meat options. \n\nI am definitely coming back to this place to try more dishes... i even wanna hit up the lunch menu!! I recommend this place and give the vegetarian.vegan menu a try.. it was not disappoint.",4
review_635822,restaurant,"Shabu is excelling in many areas, and faltering in just a few. The most glaring area for improvement is in the service arena. They don't come around as frequently as they should and they keep the broth levels really low. This causes the items to stick to the bottom of the hot pot and burn. After your initial pot of broth, they refill it with pork or chicken broth - which is about the same cost as tap water - so they need not be so stingy with it.\nMy favorite items were the enoch mushrooms and pork dumplings. Everything else was OK, but those two items were delicious. I wasn't a big fan of the oval noodles, but my husband loved them, so we'll probably get them again. I also think it's important for the gentleman to tell you not to add too much to the broth before you start dumping large quantities of meat and veggies in... not after.\nFor four of us, it was $93 - and at $50/per couple, there's some room for improvement :)",2
review_173977,restaurant,"More over-hyped celebrity chef food.  \n\nI had called in the morning to inquire about reserving a table on the patio to see the fountains, and the hostess told me they don't reserve those tables, I would just have to show up and ask to be seated there.  So I asked if I should go ahead and make a regular reservation for dinner if that was my plan and she said it wouldn't be necessary.  Well my husband really wanted to eat here, so we called a little later to make a reservation just in case, and they told us the only time left they had was 9:30pm!!  Good thing we called, or I don't even know if we would have gotten in!!  So we showed up early just in case and a different hostess very rudely said they were no longer taking names for the patio because there were too many people already on the list.   Fine, whatever.  When she takes us to our table, we're the only table open that does NOT have a view out the window so I ask if we can be seated at one of the other tables instead, and she (again) rudely tells me no, those are all reserved.  Argh.  \n\nAnyway, we thoroughly enjoyed most of the stuff in the bread basket and the olive tapenades that accompanied while we waited for our food.  People weren't kidding when they said portions were big here!!  Definitely plan on splitting everything!  \n\nOur first dish was the soft shell crab with the watermelon panzanella.  This sounded really interesting, but did not execute at all.  The soft shell crab was soggy and did not taste fresh, and the watermelon/olive/whatever else was in the salad was just a cacophany of mismatched flavors.  We forced down the crab and I ate the watermelon pieces but we left the rest.  \n\nMy husband's dish was less than memorable; I think it was the ricotta ravioli.  A giant bowl of tasteless pasta, with tasteless sausage.  If it hadn't been so blah, I would have been happy to trade my beef tenderloin au poivre with him.  It was a ginormous piece of meat, and while it was cooked properly, it just had no flavor, other than the mounds of cracked peppercorns encrusting it.  Did not taste like tenderloin quality AT ALL.  I figured I should be safe with the most expensive thing on the menu, but nope.  We left quite a bit of that too, which is pretty rare because my husband will go to great lengths not to waste food.  It was only edible slathered in the curried bisque that came with it.  The coconut yogurt sauce was just a tiny drop of white in a sea of orange.  \n\nIt was after dinner that our waiter turned a pretty bad experience around.  Since it was getting so late, most of the people on the patio had left, and he told us to get our things and that we were going to sit by the fountains!!!!  That was a real treat--we got to watch the last three or four shows before it stopped at midnight.   The entire meal experience surely would have been enhanced had we been out there the whole time!!!  So we ordered up a vanilla souffle and some drinks and THOROUGHLY enjoyed the rest of our evening out there.  The souffle was very yummy, by the way.  I haven't had too many souffles but this was tops for me.   \n\nSo the gorgeous ambience, great view, and yummy souffle contributes three stars...but the rest of our food was pretty crappy.  Three stars might be high but that view almost makes up for it.",2
review_119097,restaurant,"Pizza pizza pizza! \n\nSo Papa Johns isnt orgasmic or anything but I do love the specials they run! I normally get the 2 med 2 tops for 11$ Thats seriously a steal! We usually end up getting one with ham and extra cheese and the other is usually pretty random. Chicken with jalapenos on half and Hawaiian on the other. The toppings are always super yummy and not scarce. I love how they load on the cheese!\n\nIts usually a 15-25min wait depending on how busy they are. What I love about this PJs is the customer service. The greeter lady is seriously super kind, she acknowledges you by your first name if she knows it and is super pleasant. The workers here are also very nice and say hello upon entering. I usually always order from their app or the website on my phone. For the super bowl if you were a club member they sent you a coupon for a free large 1 top and a 2 liter! UM YES!! Its promos like that that win my heart : ) If youre a member of the pizza club you can also earn points towards free pizza! AWESOME!\n\nI'm not saying the pizza is amazing, but the deals and customer service are most def amazing! Good job guys!",4
review_28334,restaurant,"We have been going to Eastwind for years and have always enjoyed it. I'm not sure what has happened recently (I heard new management? ) but it has been going down hill fast. The final straw was when I went in on a Sunday evening to order a simple teriyaki chicken bowl and was charged over $12! I asked why and was told the \""bowl\"" is now a lunch menu item and dinner is a \""combo\"" with a salad. When I got my to go order I had to ASK for the salad (after all I did pay an additional $6 for it). When I got home I saw that all the SMALL (4\"" \u00d7 4\"" container)  salad is was only lettuce with lots of bad celery- I took two bites and threw it out! The chicken was also just blah.  So disappointed.  I won't be back.",0
review_188706,restaurant,"The month before last was Bradley Ogden's last at Caesars. Todd Williams has enamored me with his food for the better half of the last decade from my frequent trips to Vegas and for all of the culinary standouts along the strip, I'm saddest to see Bradley Ogden go.\n\nThere was never a dull day in this Michelin Star monster of a Vegas restaurant. Caesars always had my nod, but it was Bradley Ogden that had attention. The food was excellent, incredible by some standards but nothing less than outstanding by any means. The same bodes for the rest of the establishment, easily among the strip's finest.\n\nIt didn't matter if you were a first time patron or a high status player, the service made sure everyone was well taken care of from the beginning to the end of their experience. The restaurant wasn't large, but it was beautiful in its own way - contemporary, sophisticated, and elegant up from the chic decor to the personalized table sets.\n\nLike any high end restaurant, the menu was a seasonal hodgepodge of various creative edible outputs; the kind of food that is beyond anything typical, with little to nothing to reference for folks with novice palates. It's hard to pick a favorite meal when every plate had its own unique twist on it. Everything from a blue cheese souffle to their legendary burger to a seared foie gras with a scallop and potato puree had me dying for more. There wasn't anything that didn't tickle my tastebuds in a way where it didn't leave anything less than a stellar impression.\n\nR.I.P. Bradley Ogden.",4
review_272614,restaurant,"So for people from the Bay, Hot N Juicy Crawfish is a bit of a fusion of Red Crawfish on Larkin in SF and Boiling Crab in San Jose. Same concepts of your choice of spiced seafoods and appetizers, minus the one hour wait of Boiling Crab (at least the time that I went there). Our party of four was seated with hardly a five minute wait. Spicy. Spicy. Spicy. LOVED it. \n\nThe only advice I have for future patrons are:\n1) If you go and plan on going out after, PLEASE do yourself a favor and either bring a large bottle of Listerine and cologne/perfume OR\n2) Go with enough time to go home/back to your hotel for a nice, LONG shower to cleanse the smelliness from your hair, body and a fresh change of clothes!",3
review_133140,restaurant,Awesome customer service. We visit this place every time we are in vegas. But on Dec 24th they only had dinner buffet and when we told the manager (Laddi) we were leaving cause we couldn't order our favorite dish (malai paneer) he had the kitchen make it for us!! We felt so special and taken care of!! U guys gotta try this place! U wont be disappointed!!!,4
review_341526,restaurant,"God bless this place and its affinity for serving you things with the head still on or in cans. On our first visit I was obsessing over the Duck in a Can, which didn't disappoint...I had cold sweats everyday for two weeks after, needing my fix. \n\nThe Foie Gras poutine is something I've been actively campaigning to get in every restaurant in the US or at least our immediate area, but unfortunately, I can't get any of these dicks on board. \n\nOur second trip, my boyfriend and I ordered the Guinea Hen to share. After the heart stopping experience I had; unknowingly moving the whole head still casually attached to the bird, we dug into what would be one of the most delicious things we will ever eat. Thank god they give you a side I extra gravy, the giant pool of it at the bottom of the 8 quart La Crouset pan probably wouldn't do. \n  \nIf I lived in Montreal I would be outside this place everyday selling myself for poutine and sugar pie.",4
review_16801,restaurant,"I absolutely love this place. I was just there last week! In all honesty, the area is not the best, nor is the actual building. Although, once inside, depending on the time of the day, it usually is fairly clean, and the employees are very nice. I personally do not speak Spanish, but I have been coming for so long that they recognize me. But don't be alarm, most employees speak fairly good English. \n\nThough the location is questionable, the food is delicious! I LOVE their Carne Asada Burritos and this is the ONLY place I go to get a burrito. There homemade Flour Tortillas are to die for, as I am VERY picky when it comes to Tortillas. I don't go ANYWHERE else for a burrito. They also have very good Tortas too. So, don't let the location make you hesitate, it will be worth it if you LOVE a good burrito. \n\nThe Carne Asada Burrito has Beans, Carne Asada, Pico De  Gallo, and Guacamole. And before I forget, their Red Sauce has a very different taste than something you would get at Phillibertos or any other Mexican Food Restaurant. This Red Sauce goes PERFECTLY with their Carne Asada Burrito.",4
review_574798,restaurant,"Just had Ezekial's fried chicken and several side dishes by take-out last night. It was very good!

review_557387,restaurant,"Walking up to this place it has a great ambivalence and it is fairly busy. The pizza is on display and it looks delicious. I chose the white pizza and side salad and my husband selects a different type of pizza and an order of french fries.\n\nAnd then we wait.....and wait some more....now people behind us are getting their food...My husband decides to question where our order is being that it has already been 15 minutes and we are the only ones not eating. The gentleman says that our order is held up because of the french fries but should be coming up shortly.\n\nSo we waited again....and watched two other people go up and place their order.....and we waited.....I......haaaaaaaaatttttteee......waaaaiiiitttiinnnnggg........! Oh and by now the other two people who had JUST ordered are now being called up and they are retrieving their order. Guess what it is!?!? Any guesses anyone!?!??!!? TWO ENORMOUS ORDERS OF FRENCH FRIES!!! But oh no our order is still not up. Seriously....My husband goes up again to question the man at the counter and he told me that they decided that they're not going to be making any more of the type of pizza that I had selected so I just wasn't going to get pizza tonight. Right....well thanks for letting us know after we have sat here for 45 minutes hungry.\n\n I am not sure if they just did not understand that you need to tell your customers that they will not be eating that night because you're refusing to make their pizza, or if they expected us to read their minds and then try to come up with a different solution.\n\nWell the ONLY solution that I discovered about this situation was to remove myself from it completely and hope that somewhere else in Las Vegas can serve some decent pizza with some CUSTOMER SERVICE SKILLS!",0

review_418631,restaurant,"Ordered delivery from here. Decent delivery time to Holiday Inn Billy Graham -from placing the order to actual delivery only took about 25 minutes. My delivery person was very friendly and Japanese.  That's authentic...\nThe menu is basic - not much on selection but the food is pretty good. I ordered the Hunan Chicken and a side of crab rangoon. The price was a little steep for delivery though. The menu conveniently forgets to tell you there is a minimum for delivery, and the charge is $1.00 for that convenience. All told, I spend $15.00 for a meal for one person. Again, what I got was pretty good. The Hunan Chicken is mildly spicy - if you're looking for real heat look somewhere else. The crab Rangoon is a little sweet but actually very good. HUGE portion though - I think I only ate a quarter of what they sent me. The rest will get eaten tomorrow on the way back to GA. I'll order from here again, though for the price it probably won't be often.",2
review_428233,restaurant,"This place is the perfect neighborhood walk to place on a weekend. The food is amazing, they even added chicken to their menu! My one and only criticism is that the beer is warm. I would suggest on their busy nights (Fri, Sat, Sun) they get an ice chest and put their beer in that. They are serving it too fast for the fridge to keep up. Other than that, awesome!!",3

review_492730,restaurant,"Went to try this buffet after hearing a few good things about it. We arrived noticing the line wasn't so long like other buffets. We probably waited 20 mins for a table of 3. I guess the reason was because the food totally sucks!! There seemed to be a lot of experimentation and stuff that didn't work out. Wasabi mashed potatoes? Wtf? The eggs Benedict was bland, the rice in the risotto was semi crunchy, and I avoided the Asian food and sushi all together, they looked like they came from some packed food!  Food seemed to be undercooked or under flavored. I got some food that was still cold or got cold for being out too long. The wait staff was nice and friendly though. 1 star for them but 0 for the food. Avoid at all costs! Go to bacchanal M or whatever else. This is not worth $35 for brunch, gotta be crazy spending extra for mimosas for a bad experience",0

I mean, how big can a lettuce wrap be?  Turns out Jimmy John's found the jackpot of humongous lettuce leaves.  The only disappointment was the minimal amount of turkey. Everything else was incredibly fresh and tasty.  The dijon had a nice kick to it and the peppers were DELICIOUS. \n\nThe cherry on top was walking out and--gasp!--being THANKED for my business.

review_361589,restaurant,"Allow me to be an asshole for a moment while I write this terrible review. Maybe its because it was Monday, and raining.. maybe it was because I was in the mood for Humble Pie and not Mexican grill.. maybe its because restaurants in Arizona don't have the freshest sea food in the United States of America, whatever it was, I hated this place. \n\nI have this habit of asking my server what their favorite thing on the menu is.. and usually I go with it. I am adventurous, I like surprises.. So homegirl suggested the nachos or the Seared Ahi tacos.. so what do I do? I ordered a taco plate. Since I like variety, I mixed and matched and went with a fish & pork taco with black beans. The Ahi tasted wicked old and nasty fishy. I almost spit it out, but I am a lady and that is rude. The pork was very undercooked.. I don't know about you, but I have absolutely no interest in catching Trichinosis. I can think of better ways to spend my day than with nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, fatigue, fever, and abdominal discomfort.. sorry those are not things I am interested in, thanks anyway though. Beans were served cold and I swear the rice they served was something out a box from the dollar store. My dog could make better rice than that. There was shit floating in my water and the limes I asked for were so dried out that not one drop of juice came out. Seriously? Cut up some fresh ones.. its the little things that count. \n\nService was slow, but the chick was nice enough. One of the girls I went with knew one of the managers, who was supposed to hook us up with an employee discount, but conveniently forgot about us at the end.. but what are you gonna do, nothing is free anymore. \n\nI dunno, I just wasn't impressed.

review_260967,restaurant,"Had a horrible meal here last night on 9-19-11 for my Wife's birthday. It was a busy night with Jazz and fireworks at Lake Las Vegas, but the hostess was helpful and found a seat for fairly quickly. That was the end of the pros for the evening. We were greeted by a waiter after 15 to 20 minutes, ordered a glass of wine, a lemonade and a glass of water for my daughter. The wine and lemonade came out relatively quickly, 20 more minutes before we saw the water. Ordered a meal, with appetizer (Caprese), a salad and two entrees. The appetizer and salad came out at the same time, Appetizer was bland, salad was great. Then another 20 - 30 minute wait and only one of the entrees arrived. It was PENNE AL SALMONE AFFUMICATO  (Small tube pasta with smoked salmon, peas and shallots in a vodka pink sauce) - which came out more like macaroni and cheese over penne with smoked salmon mixed in.... underwhelming. My daughter ordered SPAGHETTI AL POMODORO (Spaghetti pasta, garlic, basil and tomato sauce), we will never know how it was because it never came. We all ended up sharing one entree, and despite asking the waiter several times, they just couldn't deliver. Drinks remained empty after delivered and we were never asked for another round, top off the water etc. Overall the worst service I've experienced and disappointing food. I'll not be back. The price for all this out the door (1 wine, 1 lemonade, 1 appetizer, and 1 entree) $60! Felt like I was robbed of a good  evening and half my wallet",0

They don't even have anything like Alfredo or classic Italian choices. It's all very 'fine italian' and a limited menu. The prices aren't bad though. \n\nI'll come in here for a super quick bowl of that bolognese sauce every time though. 2 minutes after ordering it lands on my table sometimes before the bread ever gets there. Service is therefore pretty good. \n\nFor desert I've tried their pancotta with pepper. That was really strong pepper. That's like a really Italian fish that I'm not sure most people will like.

review_360562,restaurant,"My fianc\u00e9 and I were in town for an event and wanted to go out for a nice dinner. Sadly, this place was a disappointment, and at least we had one another as company to make a crummy restaurant fun. \n\nI will start with the absolute worst thing about this place...... THE SERVICE!! Seriously, who is in charge of hiring here? They really need to rethink their whole staff. I would seriously equate the service of this place to that of a Pizza Hut. The waiter took zero interest in us. I asked him if the risotto was vegetarian or if it was made with chicken stock... to which he literally said \""Well, there is no meat in it and it comes with vegetables, so it is vegetarian.\"" Sorry, this does not make it vegetarian. He did not even offer to go and ask the chef like any good waiter or waitress would do. Needless to say, I did not trust him and went with the mushroom ravioli instead. Looking back, I actually wish we were the type of people who could have not tipped at all, that is how bad it was. \n\nMoving on, the food. Overall, the quality of the food was very meh. As I said, I got the mushroom ravioli, and my fianc\u00e9 got the Berkshire pork chop wrapped in pepper bacon and garlic mashed potatoes. We also ordered a side of onion rings. The onion rings were a joke. Literally, I would prefer the onion rings from Portilo's any day. I mean, I would even take Burger King onion rings over these. The ravioli was fine, definitely nothing special. This place seems to think it is way fancier than it actually is. My ravioli came out with carrots and green beans on top.... just because you make your food look \""fancy\"" does not mean it is good quality. In fact, my extra dressings were luke warm, and I had to remove them from the dish because it completely threw off the flavor. I tried the gralic mashed potatoes, and they were also fine, probably the same quality you would get a buffet. I absolutely did not feel as though the quality of the food lived up to either the descriptions on the menu, nor was it worth the prices they were charging. I think we ended up paying $50 for everything here, when in reality, it should have been much less based on the quality. \n\nThe decor is very eclectic. Definitely nothing special and it just felt like we were sitting down at a chain restaurant. \n\nNothing about this place really seems to match up. They are really trying to be something that they are not. I definitely would not recommend this place to anyone, especially if you are looking for a nice evening.",1

Kudos to Matt and Erenia for holding true to the idea of making rad, no-frills breakfast food like they do back on the farm.  I don't eat here as often as I'd like, because the lines are impossible and I don't have the time to devote to an hour wait for Saturday or Sunday breakfast, but if the night before was long and I end up sleeping in, I have no shame about grabbing some breakfast at 1:30, and the lines are usually gone by then.

So we finally received our order after 2 hours of first calling.  Totally unacceptable!  Our neighbors wanted to try this place so we dined in and gave it another shot.  We decided to eat outside since it was so nice.  The tables were disgusting, they don't clean them apparently.  We had some cheese sticks first which were not cooked enough.  My mom ordered spaghetti and meatballs which was all water on the bottom of the plate and did not taste good.  I had an Italian sub which was gross!  It had some weird after taste.  It took 2 hours to complete our experience there.  In the meantime, 2 couples walked out because it was taking so long.  The waitress smelled of alcohol.  Just a complete mess at this place!

review_128676,restaurant,"Tried this place last night. It was packed and although my friends and I enjoyed all the food overall, there were some serious service snafus. Our server was hurried and not at all on top of it. He should have had some help, as he made a couple of serious mistakes. I ordered a glass of cabernet and my partner asked for chardonnay. Almost every restaurant automatically serve the 'house' or lowest price wine when someone orders a glass of cab etc. Our server did not. He took it upon himself to substitute a glass that was 3 times the price of the house wine (the portion of wine was also very small, like 4 ounces). When the check arrived I tried to find the manager, and a hostess finally foind him outside. He was nice enough  and said he would fix the check. He reduced the  wine portion from $48 to $24, still $4 more than it should have been. Our server managed a poor apology and told me he was too busy and simply made a mistake. Hmmmm. Not buying it. Another note, get rid of the crappy, loud piped in Spanish music and add  some air conditioning,thr restaurant atmosphete made us all want to leave asap. So food 4 stars, service 2 stars.",2
review_376543,restaurant,"All you can eat for $19.99! So many good things about this place.  Nice and roomy, open 'til 3am and a big karaoke room for a big party. I'll probably need to take a several shots of soju before you can get my ass to sing anything haha. Parking is hard to find though since this is a pretty busy popular small plaza.\n\nNigiri sushi here is better than most places I'e tried. I get them all seared, but that's just my personal preference of how I like my nigiri served. So many good things on the all you can eat menu that it's so hard to recommend just a few. But here are my favorites: Soft Shelled Crabs, Sexy Roll, Baked Mussels, Scallop Roll, and Bacon/Scallop Skewer.\n\nFor desserts, Almond Mocha Ice Cream is very good but kinda of a bummer that they don't have Tempura Ice Cream.",3
review_450121,restaurant,"They take forever, and the service is terrible. It is 2 blocks from my house so I would go there out of convenience, but not anymore. The bussers are very attentive, but the servers and bar staff are garbage. \n\nExample 1- I asked for the vegan veggie sandwich with cheddar cheese and sweet potato fries. I got a sandwich with no cheese and regular fries. When I asked the server for my sweet potato fries she told me they were out. So.... You're telling me you were out of the item and didn't mention it to me or let me pick my own side?\n\nExample 2- champagne brunch. They run out of OJ after 2 glasses and have to \""go get more\"". So we ask for just a glass of champagne to hold us over, and the server tells us no its not just champagne, it's mimosas only. Are you kidding me?!?!\n\nI have many more examples, but the bottom line is if you have several hours to waste, and would like F grade service, accompanied by C grade food...this is the place to eat.",0
review_538553,restaurant,"Several people kept telling me - YOU MUST TRY Bd's Mongolian Grill!!  So when my friend had her birthday dinner there, I thought it was a great time to try it out.  Unfortunately, I just wasn't impressed.  \n\nThe party was on a Friday night and, of course it was hoppin'!  We were informed as to how the place worked, given bowls to fill, and told to have at it - Meats, Veggies, Sauces.  This is where they lost me.  \n\nThe meat... it just didn't look good.  I also didn't enjoy the idea of raw meat sitting out there for people to self-assemble.  Maybe I just worked in the food service industry too long... but eww.  Also, it just didn't look clean.\n\nThere were decent vegetables - nothing gross or moldy.  They had tofu!  Thank goodness for tofu!  If it wasn't for that, my meal would have been a disaster.\n\nFinally the sauces.  I will say, they just weren't clearly labeled clearly.  Also it was just messy.  If you don't know flavors, you won't make a successful stirfry.  There were several people at our table who destroyed their meals by incorrectly mixing sauces.\n\nThe grill is what sells the restaurant.  They guys that work the grill are efficient, comical, and friendly.  They are my reasoning for giving Bd's 3 stars.  I liked the grill.\n\nWould I return to Bd Mongolian's?  If a friend had a birthday there, yes.  If not, I probably would choose one of the other SouthSide venues for my meal.",2

review_251747,restaurant,"Just got my lunch. 3 cheese enchiladas with maybe one teaspoon of cheese total. Served luke warm with very little sauce. A huge disappointment. Had to ask for ice in my beverage and the attendant / cashier acted insulted that I wanted ice. She then proceeded to take my cup and dunk it in the ice machine to scoop some ice. This place is a disaster. Run when you see the \""open\"" sign.",0
review_488107,restaurant,"Taberna is a great spot for drinks and some decent Mexican food.   The patio is really nice,  and the d\u00e9cor is fun and resembles its menu... a modern twist on old world Mexican.  I started off with their signature margarita, it was fantastic. A bonus (which used to be standard with Mexican restaurants) is they serve you complimentary chips and salsa.   I really enjoyed the mango tomatillo salsa with the plantain chips, but the fire roasted salsa seemed to be the table favorite.  The chips are thick, but not greasy and definitely made fresh to order.  Our server was very knowledgeable and was able to provide me several vegetarian options that were not listed on the menu.  I decided to order the veggie enchilada's with a side of black beans. The beans were a little bland (not spicy as indicated on the menu), but the enchilada's were solid.  The rest of the table was not as satisfied.  No one loved their meal, and a couple peoples food came out cold, mine was not smoking hot, but definitely edible.  After a complaint was made, they promptly replaced the cool dish and the manger offered us free desserts.  For desert we had the trio of gelato and the flan.  The gelato was good; my favorite was definitely the roasted banana... Yum!  The Flan tasted more like a ricotta cheesecake.  I normally don't like flan, but this was excellent!  The meal started and ended with a bang, but what came in the middle was a little disappointing.  Despite its shortcomings, I'll definitely give Taberna another shot.",2
review_486116,restaurant,"So glad we found this place! Who doesnt love good BBQ? I mean really who doesnt?! Well we found this place the other day while driving around trying to find something for an early dinner. Inside is clean and open they even have a small dance floor and live music (not sure what days). We orderd the $20 deal with pulled pork,brisket,ribs, mac&cheese and greens with a side of sweet potatoe fries. Well they give you plenty of meat for sure but the sides are pretty small(-1 star) All the food was good creamy mac yummy greens and yummy smokey meats. Oh and the fries delish!! Customer service was great! Oh and I almost forgot the deal comes with dessert. The cobbler was soo good. A must try to cure that BBQ craving!",3
review_645617,restaurant,"I have previously been to Postinos in Gilbert and loved it. Tempe's location was also great. Probably gets extremely busy when the semester starts. I am guessing that because it was at night and during the winter break, parking was not an an issue. Might be during the school season, although there are garages near by. \n\nWe had the bruschetta for starters. I recommend all of them! I am an Arnold Palmer kind of girl and my friend loves the cucumber honey.\n\nShe had the soup of the day (cheddar and potatoes - don't remember the exact name) and thought it was pretty good. Definitely a creamy soup. We both had the chicken and mozzarella and it was delicious. I'm a cheese lover so I loved that it comes with a pretty thick slice of mozzarella. I had Hannah's Field salad and I thought it was pretty flavorful, I would definitely have it again.",3
review_167856,restaurant,"This is a must! Every time we visit Vegas this is always our  first dinner in town. The ambiance on the patio is fabulous watching the water show, and the service is pretty good. The food is always consistently delicious so make sure you save room because the fresh warm baguette and butter they give you before dinner can become very addicting.  Make sure you order a steak, it's their specialty!",4
review_172806,restaurant,"Pink Taco is one of my favorites because the menus are pink and sparkly and the waitresses never mind when I come in with my hot pink Pink Taco shot glass, and of course being loud and obnoxious doing tequila shots is just so much fun. The food is pretty good for out of California Mexican food....I like the chicken tostada salad, it would be better if it was steak...but, we can't have everything we want...\nThey freshly make their tortillas, which I guess is pretty standard now, but still a plus in my mind. \nThe one really unique thing is the tequila pina colada....it was pretty good, and if you are doing tequila shots, being able to order a frozen drinks without mixing rum and tequila is amazing.",2
review_134573,restaurant,"This place is awesome. The ambience, the food, the service was all really great. Barely waited to get seated. \n\nWe got the prix fixe as part of a Groupon. Would definitely recommend and think it's worth the normal price as well. Everything we had was pretty good, especially the meat dishes. The only thing I didnt think was THAT great was the soup. \n\nI was a bit upset that we didnt get the mint tea in the end, but other than that, I would definitely come again.",3

review_484421,restaurant,"I had high hopes for this place considering there was a relation to my favorite place to get a burger (Penguin) but what I found was sub par food and long waiting times (For a Saturday night) My family and I waited for about 40 minutes in a cramped area to get seated. Because we had a child and needed to seat her at the end of the booth due to limited seating, we were seated in the back area near the old garage doors, where there was a draft. We all kept our puffy winter coats on as we ate our dinner. \nWe ordered fried pickles and burgers. The staff was attentive and kind, very on top of things so at the very least they deserve props for that, howeverThe food was not that good, way too greasy (It messed my stomach up and thats hard to do) the burgers tasted a bit off and the fried pickels were insanly greasy. The places wasn't really enjoyable enough for me to return.\n\nThe one other positve thing I can say is that they had a great beer selection, something for everyone.",1
review_531922,restaurant,"I've been a Wahoo's regular for years. I used to go to the one in West LA at least once a week. About 10 years ago, they opened a location on the strip in the Hawaiian marketplace. Unfortunately, it went bust after only a few months. Luckily, there's a new Wahoo's in town and now I can get my Wahoo's fix. My go-to meal is the Maui bowl - marinated steak with seasoned rice and beans. This particular Wahoo's has gotten it right (tender steak, slightly rare) and gotten it all wrong (beef jerky on rice, anyone?). Your mileage may vary.\n\nThere's a special late night menu at the bar, along with a discount if you're in the hospitality industry. Hey, it sure as hell beats Del Taco at 3 am.",3

review_390867,restaurant,"I have been going to this location for awhile and either this place has went downhill or my expectations are way higher. Let me first say it is a Sunday night so it is really dead, of course. The salad bar is just boring, you get an iceberg mix, wilted spinach, a pre-made soggy caesar, and a small bagged mixed greens. There are all the normal veggies, celery, peppers, carrots, you know. The soups were atrocious looking, I tried the lentil veggie and it tasted like a cleaner, blech! I had a baked potato which wasnot completely cooked right with some margarine and sour cream that looks like it was sitting out too long. The breads were hard and bland. Everything was just meh. The state of the place is pretty bad. The carpet is stained and ripped. The booth seats are all ripped, mine was so messed up that i was sitting about shoulder height to the table, the same height as my kids on the other side. The tables were not bussed promptly, Ours wasnt bussed the whole time we were there and I hate sitting with my old buffet dishes while eating my new one. The waitress and another cook went outside to smoke and everyone was looking around for them. A guy was spraying the sneeze guard with cleaner, that can't be good, the spray most likey got on the food, hence the cleaner tasting soup. It was just an uncomfortable experience, I felt ill after leaving.",0

Quality of Food is greater than the Price.... it's just science.\n\nNam Sao is very authentic. Gives Discounts to Students.

review_550254,restaurant,"Awesome restaurant, nice vibe to the place. Waiters kind of hover around you which is annoying, but the food makes up for it. Get a steak, since it is a steakhouse. Also the toffee pudding desert at the end of your meal is a must have...no matter how full you are!",3
review_645879,restaurant,This location has excellent staff and the food is exceptional. I am allergic to dairy and they can accommodate that for me which is very difficult to do normally when going out to eat. They are quick and make it easy to get food during lunch time. The restaurant is very clean and quiet so it's a nice place to sit and talk or catch up with a friend. The smoothies are delicious and I get the chicken pesto flatbread without the dairy products and it is phenomenal. I definitely recommend that everyone come here and try this place especially if you have a dairy allergy and can't get anything at those other smoothie places.,4

review_168923,restaurant,"It was good, but it didn't meet my Yelp great expectations.  It was also not really worth the loooooong walk out there.  I read someone's review saying it was just past the Wynn, but it is WAY past the Wynn, for anyone who's walking.  In fact, it's right before the Riviera, which is pretty far down.\n\nThat being said, the food was decent.  Between 3 of us, we ordered the Maserati omelet, waffle combo, and Munch's breakfast (a special).  All were pretty good, but a bit overpriced in my opinion.  Portions were huge.  The service was ok, a bit lackluster.  Our waitress was nice enough though.  I guess I'd come here if I was close but if you're not staying at the Riviera, I wouldn't make an extra trip to come here.",2

When I called from a friend's phone and told him I didn't have my phone but that I was a previous customer and gave him my number, he said he would just drop the pizza at my house and charge my credit card if I didn't show up.

The bread not nearly crisp enough. It was kind of a small portion as well; something I would make while babysitting- not restaurant quality. My mashed potatoes - while I think real were not even hot! I likened them to nursing home mashers...yikes, My bf's chili was just ok as he put it . \n\nOverall for 2 small grilled cheese w/small sides and 2 waters it came out to $16. These were not $8 meals ...just saying. \n\nI guess I expect diner food to be more plentiful - better priced- and just all around greasy goodness.

review_569616,restaurant,"They teach you that when you're about to give bad news, you should start with something positive, right?  Here's the good...\n\nThe chips and salsa were really good.  The chips were extra salty and I was happy they arrived that way rather than me pouring on salt like I'm waiting for a heart attack.  The margarita was delicious and at happy hour prices, it's a steal.  The queso and sopas were tasty as well.  The bread pudding was also yummy.\n\nAnd the bad...  \n\nThings were not terribly well seasoned and there were no salt shakers on the tables. Perhaps it's an oversight but tables with no salt shakers are a sign of arrogance.  This is acceptable at places with gourmet food...at your neighborhood Mexican joint?  Not so much.  \n\nWhere things really fell down for me was the service.  There seem to be general chaos where the servers were concerned.  Our waiter, although he was very, very nice, seemed extremely distracted.  I noticed other tables (all in the bar section) experiencing poor service as well.  Food went to the wrong table.  The wrong check went to the wrong table.  We waited an inexcusably long time for more tortilla chips and my husband had to ask for them twice.  Our drinks sat empty for a very long time.  We even pushed our empty glasses to the edge of the table to indicate that we were not finished medicating ourselves.  Everything took far longer than it should have.  \n\nThe other thing that bothered me were inconsistencies between what was on the menu/what our waiter described and what came out.  The menu stated the bread pudding came with rum raisin ice cream (yes, please!).  It arrived with vanilla bean ice cream.  The waiter stated that it came with a blueberry sauce but it arrived with what was clearly a raspberry sauce.  It was still a tasty dessert but I like things to arrive as advertised.    \n\nI think this place has potential but they have some work to do.",1

review_319969,restaurant,"Finally: an upscale(ish) restaurant that has LEGIT pho!!!\n\nMy sister and I stumbled upon Mainland while wandering around the new section of the Palazzo shops.  It is basically a noodle house with other Asian type dishes on the menu as well.   The decor is very sleek and modern-clean lines and long bench seating.  We went on a Friday afternoon and it was close to empty-I think there was one other couple eating in there along with us.  There was an army of employees ready and eager to serve us-almost too many, I'd say...it was a little nerve wrecking having them stand around and stare at us while we ate.\n\nOnce I saw that they had beef Pho on the menu I was sold.  I really wanted to see if an upscale place could to Pho right.  And, I'd say that they really did.  It was surprisingly good...I was impressed and pleased.  I almost want to say that I liked it better than the ghetto hole in the wall place I go to get Pho in San Francisco called Vietnam, because at Mainland we got quality cuts of meat.  At Vietnam, I sometimes I cant even tell if it actually is beef and not rubber bands that are floating around in my bowl of soup.  Mainland's pho was true to what pho should taste like, and the ingredients were top quality and the establishment is clean and trustworthy- not what I'm used to when eating pho.  \n\nI should mention that my sister hated the soup she ordered at first-some sort of grilled chicken soup that she thought was going to be chicken pho but ended up having charbroiled chicken and corn in it...we sent it back and she got the soup I ordered and was enjoying.\n\nAll in all-I cant wait to come back and bring my pho connoisseur boyfriend and best friend show them that good pho can be done in a nice restaurant.  Also, I'm eager to try some of the other Asian-style appetizers on the menu that looked tasty as well!",3
review_531119,restaurant,This place serves mediocre food at best at an expensive price.  Refried beans are watery looks like they basically too a can of pinto beans and poured them on the plate.

Orders don't make it back to the kitchen or get lost (these are actual things we've been told). It doesn't matter if the restaurant is slammed or if there is only a few customers, the service is the same. We took friends from out of town to Sushi Creek a few weeks ago. There were 4 of us. We waited over an hour for our food and only 3 of us received our plates. Excuse after excuse and 25 minutes later our friend finally got his dinner. The manager did take his meal off and gave a 15% discount. Such a ashamed that had to happen.\n\nOur family went again today. Only about 4 or 5 tables occupied in the restaurant around 3:30pm. Once again our order didn't make it to the kitchen. Appetizers came out with meals. Half of my daughters food was dumped on the table and the waitress acted like nothing happened; half her meal wasted. No sense in complaining to management about the service. It doesn't seem a priority. This place could really be great if their staff got their act together. If you want really good food and are extremely patient, go to Sushi Creek.",1

review_464540,restaurant,"The pizza is well above average and the only wood fired pie (or unique in any way) in the area. The crust is phenomenal and the Italian ham that we had was not the routine variety...extremely tasty. The only reason that I don't rate this place higher is the lettuce. All of the salads from the house to the bed that the caprese rests on is shredded. Shredded! Enough with the sub topping, get some real lettuce in there!",2
review_105502,restaurant,"Meh. That's what I've got for this one.\n\nWhy the hell is there a 2 hour wait for this place? It's not bad, but it's certainly not amazing. They have tiny menu -- pizza, calzones, a app salad, and antipasto. That's it. Period. Done.  \n\nSo therefore, their customer service and food should be out of this world. They're not.\n\nI got there \""early\"" for Scottsdale, and was given a buzzer and a 30-45 minute wait, so I sat down out front to wait for the rest of my party.  My friends arrived. And we waited and waited. I went to check at 35 minutes, and we were next on the list.  Finally, at an hour, I went back inside to check. \""Oh, we buzzed you twice, you didn't answer.\"" Um, no. I purposely didn't wander somewhere more comfy and away for douchey guys with their collars popped so that I could be near the door. And if someone doesn't answer their buzzer, how about stepping the 2 feet out the door and calling their name, so maybe at the least, you could get your pizza shaped buzzer back.\n\nIt didn't really get better from there. We finally got sat. It took forever to order, and longer to get our food. Not to mention that all three of our glasses (sprite, iced tea and water) stood empty for literally 25 minutes (I timed it). Calzones came and they were ok, but certainly nothing to write home about.  From being seated to getting out of there, it was about 1 hour, 45 minutes. That's how slow the service was.\n\nI'm giving 3 stars, because I have since heard that their pizza is their thing, and I'm willing to wait and see on that.",2
review_394636,restaurant,"Great place for late night munchies and a beer! First Food & Bar is open very late and located close to the upstairs entrance. Very dark lighting that makes for a really laid back vibe. I ordered the chicken mcfingers with waffles and a fried egg. Sooo good! The waffles were crispy and the batter had to have cinnamon and other good spices. The maple syrup doused over the chicken and waffles was real, not artificial. The host and server were very friendly despite having to serve us at 2AM. Great beers on tap and mixed drinks. Overall, great late night joint on the strip!",3

review_535745,restaurant,"this place is really not good at all, probably one of the worst all you can eat sushi restaurants that I have been to. Really not worth the price for what you are getting, not to mention that they don't even include any type of dessert on the menu or even green tea. Way too many extra charges and small bland portions.\n\nI won't be returning",0

review_530569,restaurant,"This place was pretty darn good. Its a cash only and the menu is pretty simple, burgers, dogs and fries. The burger reminded me of a backyard bbq and was pretty darn good. My boyfriend had the triple and a dog (he's got a large appetite) and couldn't quite finish it all.... but don't be mistaken, you will get spankings if you don't finish your food  !! The decor is pretty corny but it was a great time.  If your down with the grease and love a little entertainment Vegas style... this place is for you!",3
review_204308,restaurant,"I usually only use Yelp to find places to eat. But my experience at Carraba's was terrible that I had to make a Yelp account to write a bad review. I don't and wouldn't recommend this place. If I can give no stars, I would. Came here for dinner with my family last week. It was our first time coming here and it will definitely be our last. The service was slow and very inattentive. When we were ordering our food, our server didn't tell us that pasta doesn't come with non-pasta dishes, only sides like mashed potatoes or spinach. When we received our food we were all surprised to see how small our \""regular\"" entr\u00e9es were. For the price we were paying we thought our food would be a lot bigger portions. The food was mediocre and cold, like it's been sitting at the window for awhile. Overall for the price it's worth it's definitely not worth paying. I even spoke to a manager regarding my concerns about our dinner and he didn't really seem to care. We won't be coming back here anyway, I'd rather go to Olive Garden!",0
review_43480,restaurant,"Now I've never been to Chicago and I've never had the deep dish, so I'm probably not the best person to be writing this review, but I'm still going to put in my thoughts! Not bad, but not good, either. What really ruined it for me was the cheese. It was just, rubbery. I don't think any kind of pizza should have rubbery cheese. That's a huge no-no for me. The crust was good, though. I liked the balance of softness and crispy.",1
review_158496,restaurant,"In town for homecoming weekend - Go Badgers! - our group had to try Mickie's.  We went on a Friday morning and the 6 of us waited maybe 5 minutes and were able to grab a big table, a big deal since it's seat yourself.  \n\nThe service was a little slow, but it's an old fashioned breakfast place, so it was expected.  As a vegetarian and health nut, I was so very happy to see whole grain pancakes on the menu board.  They were.....different.  Kind of like bread, thick, and huge.  I liked them though.  The boys of course tackled the Scrambler.....and didn't eat until 8pm that night because they were so stuffed.  \n\nOverall, a cheap breakfast place near campus which us visitors enjoyed for it's individuality.",2
review_266093,restaurant,"I was at Lake Las Vegas last night with my wife and we looked around at the other restaurants but nothing struck our fancy so we decided to give Auld Dubliner another chance.  We walked in and were told it was seat yourself.  We sat down and waited, and waited, and waited.  We were there for 10-15 minutes and no one even spoke to us.  The best part was that two different waiters were serving two different tables on either side of us.  They definitely saw us, saw we had no menus or drinks, and still did nothing.  I was willing to give this place another chance because the food was good the first time and just the service was bad.  I guess the bad service is their standard and I will never go back here again.",0

review_143264,restaurant,"awful service. awful awful awful. \n1) for our party of 9, the waiter went around and poured everyone wine but forgot to pour me. i had to be  like \""could i get some white wine?\"" before he came back and realized his mistake.\n2) my friend and i split a beet salad, and he tried to serve us the beet salad on our bread plates that still had half eaten bread and crumbs all over it. she had to be like, \""could we get two clean plates?\"" for him to go through all that extra effort of getting us clean plates. wtf?!?\n3) on our last bottle of wine, he split it among just 5 of the 9 guests.\n4) i hate it when waiters try to upsell on the wine, especially when they make it blatantly obvious. \n\nand beyond my hang up with our shitty waiter, the food wasn't that great either. beet salad seemed pretty amateur. pappardelle was decent, i will give it that much credit. but clearly they are using the wolfgang puck brand to gouge customers.",0
review_145350,restaurant,"Why hello there giant, delicious burger.  Hello indeed. \n\nYeah, that's me flirtin' with a burger.  You would too if you were at Ichabod's.  I got a teriyaki burger there that was as big as my head (do you have ANY idea how huge that noggin is?) and much, much tastier, with fries and a soda for something like $8 all together.\n\nTotally an awesome lunchtime activity if you're in the vicinity.  It was completely populated with older people, save us, and that was adorable.  They have a salad bar that I would be reticent to try, but for those who don't want to just hear \""OMG MEATY BURGER\"" there is that option.  And if the salad bar does completely suck you won't have to go far to drink your sorrows away.\n\nOddly enough, I've lived down the street from here for over a year and I've yet to visit the bar.  I'll have to remedy that the next time I want a giant tasty burger.  Really, they're good.",3
review_468532,restaurant,"Buffet spoil alert....Republic's Buffet is the best in town!!!!  \n\nEvery Saturday and Sunday they offer a buffet menu that is amazing.  For those looking to strap-on a feedback at the local casino, you may want to try something different for a change.  You order from the menu and each meal is hand crafted for you, brought to your table and served with a smile.  Try the eggs benedict over a toasted english muffin covered with hollandais sauce and lobster...and then plan on ordering it over and over and over again.  The NY Strip filet is ample and cut thick...just a way a steak is supposed to be cut.\n\nThe All You Can Eat buffet is $16 and for an additional $15 you can have bottomless Mimosas or Bloody Marys.  As a former Chicago native where new restaurants popup every week, the guys at Republic figured it out.  Thank you for bringing this restaurant  to Vegas...I wish you all the best of success!  \n\nThere are VERY few restaurants in Vegas that come close to the quality, atmosphere and professional staff of Republic.",4

Buffet overload of many food selections.\n\nI love this place because it's tapa style so you can try a bit of everything without wasting food that you couldn't finished!  I love the presentation of the food too.  It's beautifully-styled and arranged.  They got a bit of everything, however, I must say, the Asian food section was OK.  Not a lot of sushi selection and asian food.\n\nMy favorites:\n*Angry mac n cheese\n*Cheese platters\n*Roasted chicken\n*Dessert sections!\n\nDon't forget the dessert section.  I felt like I was in a desert heaven! Bite-sized  ice cream, gelatos, chocolates, strawberry dipped in chocolates, small bakery desserts...yum o yum o...that section was my weakness.  I must have had sugar overload and went straight into food coma afterwards...but, totally worth my $ and pallet.\n\nEnjoy!  =)",3

I used to rank the burgers as best in town but now we can't stomach it.  Foods cold or undercooked as has been for past year. It's a great state atmosphere but we can't cheer much if we are throwing up outside. Seriously, please please please please please please just fix the food.  Serve a limited menu on gameday no one wants a salad.  Just focus on a small number of items and do them well.  We just went to another bar and the owner came out and asked what we liked and how he can improve.  Do that.  Take a poll.  Get it back to how it was years ago please.  This review will be 5 stars if you do.",2

review_639679,restaurant,"I came back the 2nd time craving for some shrimps and I didn't get any!!! Horrible horrible service. I ordered one pound shrimp along with crawfishes. The crawfishes came out but not the shrimps. Our server seem to be avoiding eye contacts. I told her the shrimp never came, she said they back up in the kitchen, alright then. Then I notice they bring out shrimps for this couple that show up after us. I asked three servers and they all said they'll check on it, yet avoiding my eyes when am waiting for them to come back. We done with our crawfishes and still no shrimps!! The check came out and I told the girl I still have not get my shrimp, she can cancel it, her response was \""ill see what I can do\"". Came back and says that she was able to remove it from the check, well shit! Of course  am not paying for something I didn't get! As if it was trouble to ask her to not charge me. One more things, they decide to pull out a bin of trashes and instead of going thru the front door, they made my friend get off from her seat so they can pull the bin across, how rude!!!",1
review_406722,restaurant,"Uhm I don't know why I come here.\n\nI think it's because I'm yearning for my Filipino childhood. I usually hit this place up when I'm desperate for Filipino spaghetti.

I know, it's weird.\n\nbut the spaghetti is usually runny or watery with their sauce. The chicken? It's aight. I'd come back here only for the spaghetti.

review_76954,restaurant,"We ordered take-out from this place and the only plus was that it came pretty quickly. Other qualities of the food included being too salty and too much sauce.

review_538288,restaurant,Found this place to be very expensive for the amount food that we got. We order a rack of beef ribs it was &24.99 and it was 4 half ribs.  We also ordered the meal that said 2 to 4 people for $35.00 and was 2 small sides and 4 small biscuits and all the meat was in one styrofoam tray and didn't even come close to feeding 4 people.

review_513807,restaurant,"Earlier today (Friday Aug. 12, 2011) I attended Genghis Grill for lunch.  I was able to find the establishment with no troubles, and parking was bountiful. \n\nWhen my date and I walked in, we were given a tin bowl and were escorted directly to an open booth.  Our drink order was taken seconds later and we were told we could go up and begin to create our custom stir-fry bowls.\n\nI must say, I did not understand or believe people that said you can get any meat you want, and as much of it as you want.  Well, this is 100% true.  To the side of the restaurant, there is an open serving area with the labels: \""Proteins\"", \""Seasonings\"", \""Veggies\"" \""Sauces\"" and you pick your \""Starch\"" at the grill.  \n\nWhen the food arrived a few minutes later, I was more than pleased with my unique and one-of-a-kind creation.  Initially, I was worried about how my sauces would mesh together - I went with the mongolian bbq, 3G, and dragon sauces.  But it turned out to be the perfect combination of sweet and heat.  \n\nOverall, I was extremely pleased my Genghis Grill lunch experience.  It was extremely filling and as very well priced - around $22 for two people  (I have taken a picture of my bill). \n\n**BEWARE**  - As others have stated, beware of mixing different sauces.  Be sure you know what your getting.  -You are allowed TWO starches if you prefer.  I recommend the tortilla and brown rice.  -If you live anywhere in north Charlotte, it can be over a 25min drive. -This place has a ton of options to choose from.  To be  prepared, my date and I went on the Genghis website where you can use their interactive menu to draft your meal before you go. This place can be hectic during prime eating hours. My date went here a time prior, and felt rushed by other patrons behind her. Therefore on this trip we planned our meal ahead online and went during non-peak hours.",3

review_623389,restaurant,"I was a big fan of the old Pomo having gone there with family a couple of years ago.  Yes, the intimate feel is gone but the service and the food is still top notch. \n\nThey brought that mural of Sicily from the old place over to this new location. We were with two family members so we started with a couple appetizers,  the Caprese and something I have never had before, the Crocchete Pugliesi (potato croquettes filled with Fior di Latte and prosciutto). Both were excellent and reasonably priced. \n\nThen on to our personal pizzas.  I had the Principe (prosciutto, arugula and shaved parmigiano reggiano). The wife had the Peppino ( ricotta cheese, hot calabrese salami). On the advice of a family member we tried the pizza with a drizzle of their hot pepper flake olive oil.  OMG. I will be doing that from now on. The pizzas were as good as I remembered from the old place and made a great midnight snack straight out of the refrigerator.  :)\n\nI really liked the take out and market place on the left as you walk in.  From what I am told it is a very popular lunchtime option which they didn't have at the old Pomo.",4

review_830,restaurant,"Sharia don't like it, and neither does Becky. \n\nBoy and I went to Casbah on a warm Tuesday evening. The restaurant wasn't busy, and we were seated in the inviting outdoor patio. Our waitress was very pleasant and extremely informative about both the drink and food menus. \n\nWe shared a bottle of Mission la Caminade (Malbec, French). This was a very good, medium-bodied wine. \n\nMany yelpers have raved about Casbah's bread and pesto. I don't get it. I've had much better sourdough elsewhere and the pesto wasn't anything to write home about. \n\nI had the asparagus soup with crab for an appetizer.  The soup was served cold and tasted fresh enough, but something was off, and I barely ate half of it. \n\nI ordered the orecchiette pasta as an entree, which was served with grilled chicken and cranberries in a goat cheese cream sauce. I am upset to report that this tasted rather bland. The cranberries were the only spark of flavor in the dish.  Boy ordered the ricotta cavatelli pasta, which was in a marinara sauce with sausage and ricotta. I am sad to report that this too was tasteless. The ricotta was dumped on top and added nothing to the dish. \n\nWe glanced at the dessert menu, after spending so much on food we didn't enjoy, boy and I decided to cross the street for ice cream, instead. \n\nOverall, Casbah has a nice atmosphere and service, but their food quality doesn't match the price tag.",1
review_74653,restaurant,"The food was just OK.  The decor and view from our window table were excellent, but the upscale, or romantic atmosphere we expected was mixed in with a TV over the bar near our table, airing sports, and a too loud piano player in the adjoining lounge (where the TV should have been, if there at all).  Our waitress was excellent, and knew the menu inside out.  The bus boy, on the other hand was overly intrusive, and rolled his eyes when we requested a fresh glass of water, as he had poured sparkling water (Pelligrino) into the plain water glass of one of our party.  Perhaps a language barrier.  Wish I had known about the 1/2 price specials listed in the other reviews. Had our bill been 50% less, there would be more stars as price to quality is important, when considering the entire experience.  At an average of $60 per person, including the tax and tip, and with only 1 beer and 1 glass of wine on our bill, I felt the food, itself should have been much better, and the atmosphere less like a sports bar with loud music.  A positive note is that, at the end of our meal, a man came to our table and introduced himself as the manager.  He asked if we had enjoyed our experience. We were polite, but not shy to tell him our thoughts.  He's only been the manager there for a short time, but not only listened to our coments, but asked questions, so he could make improvements for future guests.  I found him sincere.  He didn't give us any sort of discount, or other consideration, but that's not why we complained, anyway.",1

review_35984,restaurant,"As a lover of Italian food and an even bigger lover of not leaving my house, I decided to give this place a try! As a first impression, I think it went pretty well, and I'm looking forward to my next experience with this place. I ordered the Lasagna and an order of mozzarella sticks. My review:\n\nMenu/Ease of Ordering: 5/5 Used GrubHub and everything went pretty well. They have a pretty large variety of options here also, which is always appreciated.\n\nDelivery: 4/5 I ordered at around 7:40PM and I had an estimated time of 8:40-8:50, which is pretty standard for a delivery place. I received my order at around 8:30PM, so a little ahead of schedule. The food was nice and warm still, which is sometimes hard to do with pasta dishes. The lasagna came in a nice foil container, helping retain the heat, the stix in the standard styrofoam container. My only complaint was that some of the sauce from the lasagna leaked out onto the plastic bag and then the styrofoam from the sticks and the napkins they included. Mildly annoying, but forgivable. \n\nLasagna: 4/5 Pretty decent lasagna. I've had better, I've had worse. This lasagna has quite the variety of meats: sausage, beef meatballs, and ham. I've never had ham in lasagna before, but I honestly couldn't taste it in particular in this dish. I'm not a fan of sausage, and it was quite flavorful here. Which, if you're a fan of, I'm sure you'd love. The meatballs tasted nice. Quite cheesy with a decent amount of extra sauce. I don't know if I'd order this again, but it quelled my craving for lasagna.\n\nMozzarella Sticks: 3/5 Eh, these were just okay. They gave you an ample amount of them, but they just weren't all that great. 7 or 8 sticks and some marinara. They clearly tasted frozen and didn't have too much flavor to them. I will not order these again. \n\nAll in all, a pretty decent experience.",3
review_215091,restaurant,"I went here with a fellow Yelper who had a fabulous coupon from restaurant.com.  At 11:30 AM, it was one of few places that was willing to serve both breakfast and lunch.\n\nI ordered the club sandwich and side salad, she ordered the french toast, and we shared the hummus/crab pate appetizer.  We asked for everything to be brought out at once because we were in a bit of a hurry, and it was all served at the same time.  My side salad was yummy, with all of the non-lettuce accompaniments chopped into tiny little cubes.  The sandwich was on bread about the thickness of a pita and made panini-style.  I loved it: turkey, ham and bacon makes everything better.  \n\nThe appetizer was a good one to share, but I definitely wouldn't want it all for myself.  I enjoyed the roasted red pepper hummus and my partner in crime enjoyed the crab dip.  We both enjoyed the sliced veggies and grilled pita for dipping.  It was on a huge serving platter sized plate though, and I felt bad leaving so much food behind.\n\nThe service was good, the patio was wonderful and the food was yummy.  My only complaint is the bit o' 'tude we got from the waiter when we told him we were using the coupon, at the beginning of the meal.  He said it was only good for dinner, even though it didn't say so, then did us a \""favor\"" by honoring it.  Mildly annoying, but nothing that would prevent me from returning.",2

review_50269,restaurant,"My husband and I recently stayed at the Buttes and were looking forward to a great dinner at Top of the Rock.  What a disappointment!  We dined on a Sunday night when the restaurant was almost completely empty (there were only 7 couples the entire night, including us) and were seated far away from the window and any chance of a view.  Perhaps an empty restaurant left the staff feeling less than excited about work, as service was mediocre at best.  My husband ordered the beef short ribs, which was a fairly decent dish.  Unfortunately, I ordered the pork tenderloin.  The pork was so salty that I couldn't even finish it, and the overpowering garlic in the accompanying side of creamed barley ensured it remained mostly untouched on my dish.  We left without a single goodbye, feeling as unappreciated upon exit as we did upon arrival.  If you're looking for a nice dinner, save your money and go to Kai or Ko'Sin at the Sheraton Wild Horse Pass Hotel!",1
review_538755,restaurant,"I will first start off this review by saying if you haven't been here before, you need to visit this place!  My girlfriend and I headed here before the Pirates game this past Tuesday after I found some high ratings for it here on Yelp.  The outside of the restaurant makes it look like the inside of the establishment would be your average neighborhood bar.  That couldn't be further from the truth though as the inside modern chic and they have a really awesome speakeasy downstairs.  There was also upbeat jazz music in the background the whole time we were there and they have live music on the weekends.\n \nMy girlfriend and I decided to start off our meal with the veggie fries that came with a trio of dipping sauces.  We weren't really sure what to expect from them but whenever they came we saw that we had chosen wisely.  In addition to your normal zucchini fries, there was also portobello and green and red bell pepper fries.  The breading was perfect as it helped to enhance the flavor of the vegetable but was thin enough to let you taste the vegetable as well.  All three dipping sauces (a tomato relish, white cheddar something? and a bacon ranch) were also good with the bacon ranch being my favorite.  For my entree I ordered the Buttermilk Chicken which was a fried buttermilk battered chicken breast with white cheddar grits and collard greens.  The first thing that I noticed whenever my dish came was how large the chicken breast was and that it had a great golden brown color to it.  I was actually impressed with how moist the chicken inside it was but was slightly disappointed in the lack of seasoning in the batter.  This was easily remedied though as I asked for some hot sauce and while waiting for it to come tried some of my grits on top of it.  Both did the trick and I ended up thoroughly enjoying alternating between the two.  The grits by themselves were awesome as they were easily some of the cheesiest grits that I have ever had before.  Finally the collard greens were cooked nicely and had no bitterness to them at all.  When all was said and done it was easily one of the best meals that I have had in the burgh lately.  The server that we had, Jarrett, was also awesome and one of the best that I have had recently.  He was polite and engaging while easily answering all of the questions that we had for him which really helped to enhance our experience here.\n \nThe bottom line for me is that I will definitely be back here in the future.  I am actually excited to head back here for not only the food, but to have cocktails on a weekend night and listen to some jazz music.  This is definitely a hidden gem on the North Side!",4

That's how much I love Palatte!\n\nFrom the hospitality (one of the owners met us at the door and graciously pointed out the menu and ordering procedure) to the food, everything was spot on! Finding it neither pricy nor pretentious, even my husband, who was very skeptical of going on yet another Yelp inspired dining adventure, was also impressed!\n\nArriving at 11ish on a Saturday morning, the crowd was lively and not too large, which made my husband very happy, as he hates to wait. After reviewing the very inspired and delectable menu, we got in line to place our order (short line, nice people!). The young lady who assisted us at the counter was absolutely delightful and after a few quick questions, we decided on the Lemon Crme French Toast, bacon, Tahitian vanilla yogurt, Melted Tomato Tarte, Iced Tea and Lemonade.\n\nWe paid for our order and wandered out on to the expansive and inviting patio to find our place in the sun, and to my husbands delight (he hates the sun!) there was a lovely table for two on the patio with a great view of the courtyard and a pleasant distance from the guitarist who was unobtrusively entertaining the guests. We took our seats and continued to enjoy the morning.\n\nFirst to arrive were our beverages, which were both good, but unremarkable. After a few moments, our server appeared with our entrees. My husband really enjoyed his French Toast (coconut, lemon curd and blackberries.... yummy!) and remarked that although this was the first time he had ever had French toast without syrup, it was very, very good on it's own (with the lemon curd, of course) and didn't need any syrup. His bacon, like the beverages, was also unremarkable (we were hoping for something like they serve at Matt's) but it was tasty and not overcooked (a pet peeve of mine).\n\nMy Melted Tomato Tarte was so darling, it was almost too cute to eat! The crust was light and flaky and the egg and bits that comprised the tarte were heavenly, although a few bites struck a sour note when what tasted like Dijon mustard had been mistakenly baked into the tarte. But since the rest of the tarte was awesome, and only two small bites struck that odd note, I let it pass without comment. The Tahitian vanilla yogurt was very creamy and flavorful, but had way too many sliced apples on top for my liking (a French thing, maybe?)\n\nEarlier, while waiting for our breakfast, I wandered back into the little shop that is part of the interior of the home and met a delightful young lady who was wrapping up little packets of silverware and napkins with bits of string. She was expecting and was actually past due, trying to pass the time while awaiting the arrival of her little girl, Ruby. I wished her many blessings and went back to join my husband at our table and enjoy the lovely surroundings.\n\nThe guitarist was a very pleasant surprise as well. Although he looked a bit like a folky Joey Ramone, his sound and range were simply amazing! He really added to the ambiance and we found ourselves staying longer than we had planned because he was really that good! Armed with nothing more than his guitar, mic and small amp, his catalogue included smashingly good renditions of Harry Connick's Don't Get Around Much Anymore, John Mayer's Waiting for the World to Change and my favorite, the Gilberto, Jobim and Getz version of The Girl from Ipanema.... wow, that made my whole weekend!\n\nLater, as I decided to use the WC to wash my hands before we enjoyed the rest of the day, I ran in to the same young lady who took our order and mentioned how much we enjoyed our morning at Palatte and how darling everything (including the bathrooms) were and she told me that the whole place was conceived, designed and brought to life by the owner, Christine, who was trained in France and had a passion for what she did. She offered to introduce me to Christine, who she said, was just outside passing the time until her baby arrived. I told her that we had already met (even though I didn't know she was the owner at the time) and would be sure to let her know how much we enjoyed our morning. By the time we were done chatting, Christine was gone, so perhaps she was off to meet Ruby for the first time...which will give us yet another reason to go back to Palatte! Palatte was just such a pleasant surprise from the food and the servers to the atmosphere and the entertainment; I still just want to move in!! Even the toilet paper was soft!! I so heart this place and will be back again soon. Christine and Ed have done an excellent job in making their dream a reality and have created a little slice of  rustic French countryside for us to enjoy right here. They got every detail right and I will continue to call Palatte home (at least on Saturday Mornings!)",4
review_581484,restaurant,Good food as always however Togo experiences was not good. I had asked for ketchup packets the girl told me she put some inside but there were none. \n\nDining in experience were great our server remembers everything and offers lids for my sauces along with my to go box.\n\nThe food does take a while though both take out and dine in but I guess that applies to all the B dubs that I've been to. Lol,2
review_379643,restaurant,"We have had breakfast to go a few times here. Nothing special! Eggs, bacon, breakfast burrito, hash browns. Food was good, nothing to write home about. Just Yelp it!! We are going to give this place another try since we only had breakfast. So coming soon to the nearest Yelp, will be my update!!",2
review_602590,restaurant,"First time experience and it was good. I was highly impressed with there choices at the salad bar. So many choices and it was all very good. The meat choices were all good on an average. Some I didn't care for and some were good. The only choice that stood out for me was the garlic sirloin, which is odd for the cut of meat and what I usually prefer. This is my first experience at a Brazilian steakhouse so I have no comparisons, but the meat quality was average to good nothing special. I definitely will be bringing others back here every once in a while.\n\nThe only negative thing I can really say is the whole red/green card thing was a joke. They didn't follow that one bit and started asking us for meat as soon as we sat down eating our salads. it seemed like they ignored that and just brought us whatever meat based of the table next to us and what they were eating. It made it a little hard to enjoy when they showed up with 4 cuts of meat at once and nothing for 5  minutes. They could of done a better job a timing and spacing it out. It was like all or nothing it seemed. Overall that wouldn't prevent me from coming back.",3
review_378878,restaurant,"Food is indistinguishable from any of the Chinese spots you can order by meal numbers.  Therefore, it's overpriced. I wouldn't mind paying what I did if it was a good meal but it wasn't memorable.",1
review_234175,restaurant,"I think the sad sad day has finally arrived when gorging myself to the point of bursting is no longer appealing.  There was a time when my Vegas experience wasn't complete without rolling myself out of a buffet, but I've grown wiser (and thinner).\n\nI came here twice over the weekend while staying at Red Rock - once for dinner and once for brunch. Both were $16.99 after the $2 player's club discount and we also had coupons for 1 free buffet and 2 for 1. So for the 3 of us, it ended up only costing $6/person. That's cheaper than McDonalds! You should check the local paper because there are always coupons. \n\nIt was slightly disconcerting that the food at dinner and brunch was mostly the same, but it's not often that I have the opportunity to eat prime rib for breakfast. There are tons of choices from Italian to Asian, Barbeque, Sushi and \""International\"" (which appears to be mostly Mexican). The prime rib is very good, but some of the other foods were a little dried out. The tortillas were like cardboard and the biscuits shattered into a million crumbs when I tried to split one. I also liked the mashed potatoes and tapioca pudding - I know, I know, I can't help it, I love cheap carbs. \n\nService was very good and our plates were always cleared quickly and drinks were refilled. I'll probably come back if I stay at Red Rock again, but I might be steering clear of buffets for a little while.",2
review_220270,restaurant,"The food was good. The service sucked! Our server 'Ceasar' was super nice when he first came to the table. However after our entrees were delivered, that was the last time we saw him. I have never, ever....ever been somewhere that let's a beer glass go completely empty. Let alone a glass of tea, which both happened. The busser actually filled my husband's tea, and another server came and offered us boxes. Then I was finally offered a 2nd beer after I was about 97% done with my meal.\nIt is a shame, because the menu was inventive. We would have tried other items, like we were going to order dessert, but due to the neglect we will not be returning.",1

review_325312,restaurant,"Usually when I travel on business I choose to seat at the bar to have dinner. It is less awkward than occupying a table by myself. I've had great service here at the bar, the staff knows their drinks and have always been on point when recommending vegetarian options from the menu. \nNot sure if it is the fact that Phoenix is not as expensive as my other business stops around the country, I found the prices I've paid here very reasonable for the amount of food and drinks consumed.\nPlenty of vegetarian options, wonderfully creative drinks, attentive staff and reasonable prices. What's not to like.\nWhenever you find yourself in Phoenix, whether on business or otherwise, stop here to nourish yourself. You will not leave disappointed.",3
review_494873,restaurant,"After a weekend high rollin at the Cosmo, the wife and I wanted to get a quick bite before heading back to reality.  I saw this joint and the 20.12 special for lunch.  We were tired of the usual breakfast fare so we thought we would try something different.  \nGlad we did.\n\nThis restaurant has a very cool, modern feel to it.  High end looking but not snobby.  We each got the lunch special.  For appetizer I got the grilled octopus.  Gotta pay an extra $10 but well worth it.  Nice char to it and a surprisingly good portion with olive oil and seasonings.  The wife got the greek plate which consisted of a hummus, a tzatziki (did I spell that right?), and some kind of bell pepper spread with like 3 pieces of pita.  The wife loved it but again why only 3 pieces of pita?\n\nFor main course, I got the Lavraki which is a sea bass.  Nice and light with olive oil and lemon.  Just 3 bites in, the wife was eyeing my plate.  So we did the ol switcheroo.  That means I ended up eating her tuna burger.  While not a big fan of tuna burgers this one was actually pretty good.  Its not a seared tuna, its fully cooked but surprisingly not dry.  \n\nFor dessert, the wife got a yogurtini and I got the walnut cake.  The yogurtini was more like a yogurt parfait.  The walnut cake was nice and moist.\n\nI think that you cannot go wrong with the lunch special.  Since we sat near the kitchen I saw the lamb chops and lobster pasta going out and they both looked pretty tasty.  Next time, we may try the dinner menu.  Thumbs up from me.",3

review_576241,restaurant,"NEVER GOING BACK.\n\nWhen I made reservations for a group of 9 people, I was told that we would not be able to order a la carte and the staff recommended a family style menu at 70$ a head, not including alcohol or tip.  Once we got to the restaurant, waiter told us that group menus were 55$ a person. Already off to a bad start.\n\nIf I can resume my experience in 3 statements:\n\n-HORRIBLE SERVICE: We were seated at 8:00 pm and only got our first entree around 9:00 pm. We actually waited 30 minutes between each service and the minute I complained about it the food started to magically appear out of the kitchen at a quicker pace. My opinion was that the waiter was trying to get us to spend more money on wine by slowing down the service. Thumbs down.\n\n-HORRIBLE AMBIANCE: Music was way too loud, temperature was insanely hot it was a sauna in there. A restaurant that small, packed with that many people and with that kind of ''reputation'' should be able to afford decent air conditioning for clients. I was literally drenched in sweat by the time our main course arrived. Not a pleasant dining experience to say the least.\n\n-AVERAGE FOOD: Food was ok but nothing to brag home about, and whoever gave this restaurant anything higher than a 3 star rating must be a tourist. Oh, and get this: the wine list only has CANADIAN WINES. And they're not cheap either. \n\nMy cousin was visiting from Italy and we wanted to show him a good time on his first night in Montreal, and instead his and my whole family's experience at Maison Publique RUINED our evening. We were so glad to get the bill and get the hell out.\n\nVery disappointed and will go out of my way to tell people how horrible this restaurant is.",0
review_113940,restaurant,"Food is acceptable, service is terrible. \n\nI have eaten at this restaurant three times; twice for lunch and once for dinner.  Each time I have visited this restaurant, the service leaves something to be desired such as...... decent service. It takes 3-10 minutes to be acknowledged by the hostess once you are at the restaurant, time to be seated (even when there are only a few patrons), and even longer to be acknowledged by any one to take a beverage order.  The staff makes you feel as if they are doing YOU a favor by even talking to you/taking your order and the general ambiance is bland.  Once I called to ask if a reservation was needed, the hostess said no and hung up on me.   When we arrived we requested to sit outside and we were informed that the tables were all reserved / taken for the night.  During the whole night and the two hours it took to eat, the patio was less than half full.  For the most part, the staff is unprofessional, took time chit chatting instead of helping people and seemed immature.  The waitresses were the only ones that worked and polite, but the kitchen and overall service is very slow.  I do not recommend this place for lunch if you have any time constraints.  The last time I visited, the two parties on my right and left each had issues with either the service or the billing and the manager had to speak with them. \n\nThe food, overall, is decent and some items are over priced.  One member of our party ordered ravioli which was $20; the issue was that the plate had a total of 5 medium sized raviolis and they were still hungry after an appetizer and dinner course (that's $4 for each piece of a medium sized no-frills ravioli!!).  The appetizer of basic bruschetta for two is $12 and fries are $8.  I had the beef burger twice; once it was very dry and the second time it was good.  I would probably be fine with the prices, if the service was not so bad.\n\nOne note.... The menu varies from day to day so you may want to check their web site prior to going to make sure they are serving what you like on that day.  However, don't always expect to have their daily offered selections available.  I went once with my mother at 5pm and she tried to order a chicken dinner.  The waitress stated they had ran out of chicken! At 5pm!  The restaurant was not even that busy and that was one of their 6 main courses offered that day.  \n\nI will not be going back here a 4th time.  If you are planning on going to Mill Ave in Tempe to eat....   there are a lot more restaurants available that offer better food, prices, and service than Cafe Boa.",0
review_486230,restaurant,"Made reservations weeks ago, showed up for dinner and they said we didn't confirm!

review_421072,restaurant,"First time here with my baby for a date night dinner. The server was really nice and the services is really good. I wasn't really happy with the steak, I'm sure the chef can do better than what I can cook at home. I ask for medium rare. And the steak come out bloody rare with no flavor at all. I was really disappointed with the steak. I normally go to Mon abi gabi at Paris. And the steak have soo much flavor and cook the way I wanted. Lucky my gf order some lobster, so I ate the steak with lobster at the same time so I won't give up on the steak so fast. But then I find a hair on the lobster. That just Kill dinner. I work 10 hours today. Didn't eat anything all day. I'm saving my belly for this dinner. Wasn't really happy about it. So the manager come over and he did his job well. He said he won't charge us for the mistake they make. But what make me write this review because I was so piss when I saw the bills. I feel like I'm being rib off. He did take off the lobster part but then he charged steak witch I had 2 bite and I don't want to eat it anymore after I saw the hair. I own a business my self. When the customer is not happy about my services ? I won't charge them and even offer them to come back with a free services. This is the right way to run a business FYI. I pay $150+ for my dinner. I end up cooking instant noodles at home because I didn't get to enjoy my steak dinner :(",0

review_573983,restaurant,Terrible. Unless you enjoy sub par service ! \nThis is the 3rd time here and still a bust. It is not busy. And the waitress found more time to socialize then to check on our table and see if we wanted anything else. Menu's were taken from us after ordering appatizers. Did I want dinner well yes! Will I get it here? No not unless you want to ask the waitress that pulled the wedgie out of her but then proceeded to serve others. Avoid this stop.,0

Not terribly appetizing.\n\nI may try it again to see if the soup is ok.  My wife won't.",2
review_227263,restaurant,"What a fantastic restaurant, especially during Restaurant Week! The food overall was really good and at a very good value on Restaurant Week prices. The outdoor patio is cute and there was a live jazz band when we visited on a Saturday evening. I had:\n\n- Vegetarian Tostadas: Yum! The guacamole and chipotle aioli was quite delicious and nicely balanced the sweet cabbage\n- 12 Vegetable Enchiladas: Amazing! These have to be the best vegetarian enchiladas I've ever had - real vegetables with a lot of flavor instead of just cheese.\n- Bread Pudding: This was the only average food item we had all night. I just didn't love the combination of fruit and chocolate and cinnamon - personal flavor preference.\n- Jalapeno Creamed Corn: Oh my gosh delicious. Sweet & hot at the same time - I highly recommend this side dish.\n- Chipotle Cheddar Mashed Potatoes: Also really great - full of flavor and very satisfying.\n\nThe service we received while at Fuego Bistro was excellent. Our server was great and provided prompt service without being intrusive. She was also very observant - I ordered a vegetarian appetizer & entree, and had selected vegetarian-sounding sides that actually were not. She asked if I was vegetarian and let me know that the sides I had selected actually contained bacon. Now that's great service!",4

review_478118,restaurant,"Otto wasn't on my Vegas food-genda but was a delicious surprise!\n\nOn our last day in Vegas, we found ourselves hungry and tired in the Venetian at lunchtime.  I didn't have the energy to trek back towards Bouchon so we scanned the Otto menu and were sold.  \n\nWe were seated in the very back corner of the indoor patio.  I was a bit concerned that we might be forgotten but our service was very friendly and attentive throughout the meal.   \n\nThe meat and cheese selections were alluring but for our last day in Vegas, we went for broke and ordered a couple of the fritti selections.  The Arancini and Calzone were both delish.  The saffron risotto of the arancini was so perfectly flavored, my guy declared them the best he's had.  The calzone was very yummy and very rich.  I was surprised not to see some tomato sauce to cut some of the creamy fattiness but didn't mind a bit.\n\nFor main courses, we continued to indulge and went the pizza route:  Pancetta and Goat Cheese for me and Artichoke and Prosciutto Cotto for manfriend.  We both enjoyed the crisp, cracker crust.  Good amount of toppings.  The goat cheese on my pizza had perfect tang and creaminess.  Mine was good but I reeeeally liked the artichoke pizza.  Delicious cheese and prosciutto, great subtle lemon flavor.  Very nom.\n\nVegas is pricey but Otto's items were only a couple dollars more than a comparable place in the Bay Area where we're from.  No sticker shock here but I can imagine other blanching at paying $20 for an individual pizza.  That said, they were a generous size and very filling.  You definitely get your money's worth.\n\nThanks, Mario!",3
review_2999,restaurant,"The other reviews are spot on about the ambiance.  It's very frat house chic, with lots of crappy fourth hand furniture, flickering fluorescent lights and turkish news playing on the the big screen TV (WTF?) \n\nIt is a bitch to find, especially at night, so pack your gps.  Once you find the building, you have to punch in the code ( It was 0002 when I went) for the door to get into the lobby at least at night.  Once you're in the lobby, you have to go to the elevator and hit \""M\""  for mezzanine level.  There was no sign telling us to do that and the elevator wouldn't let us select any other floor without a security badge, so it took us a little while to figure out.  Once we stepped off the elevator, my friend was having serious second thoughts about the place because of the sketchy vibe, but I'm glad we stayed because the food was REALLY REALLY good.  \n\nI got a meat lovers pizza that was absolutely piled with pepperoni, sausage, ham,  and bacon.  It was really tasty.  My friend got the Lamb Shish Kabob which had some sort of magical spices on it.  It was like a circus in your mouth.  It also came with some kind of flat bread with sesame seeds which was really good.  \n\nThe location (second floor, over the river and through the woods)  and the atmosphere absolutely suck, but the food definitely didn't disappoint. I knocked off 1 star for sketchiness, but the place redeemed itself when our order came out.  If this place found a  little nicer location on street level, it would own.",3

review_368574,restaurant,"I used to dine at CPK a lot many years ago due to my love for pizza and pasta.  However, with my healthier diet, I've stayed away from this chain for quite some time.  \n\nSince I had arrived at the McCarran International Airport early and was hungry for some food, I decided to have lunch at CPK.  Usually this place is packed but being Sunday, the weekend right before Thanksgiving, it was pretty empty, which was great for me.  I was seated immediately, but it took some time for the waitress to come take my drink/lunch order.  The menu is definitely smaller compared to their non-airport locations.  I ordered the cranberry spring mix salad with chicken, and it was pretty good especially when I compare it to the other restaurant options that were available to me (cold, prepackaged sandwiches and salads).  \n\nIn terms of service, I was disappointed that it took so long to get my drink order (just a glass of water) and prepare a cold salad when the restaurant was pretty empty.

review_358338,restaurant,"When I first went over a year ago, the prices were reasonable. Prices have been going up quite a lot and food standards have been dropping. Their noodle soups are still reasonably priced, but of poor value -- the meat and ingredients are typically of very poor quality, e.g., rough, dry, tiny. Satay chicken are dry, hard, and very pricey. Meats in dishes are quite sparing in amount. I wish there was a good Malaysian restaurant in Edinburgh. There is another with a very very limited menu, but higher quality. We will visit Kampong Ah Lee now only if I am very desperate now. If they could improve their quality or lower their prices back to a reasonable level, we would come back.",0

review_235221,restaurant,"My mom, sister, husband and I went to Escobar's for my sister's birthday -- it was a Sunday so we had brunch.  The restaurant was cute -- nicely decorated and comfortable.  The waiter was very personable and helpful with suggestions and descriptions of dishes.  \n\nI started with a limeade, and my mom and sister had coffee -- a fantastic blend developed at the Columbia Street Roastery (which is next door).  We were served cornbread with orange zest mixed into the batter.  It was a little bit sweet for my taste (but I tend to prefer more savory cornbread in general).  We ordered platanos fritos, which were subtly spiced with cinnamon, and served with black beans on the side -- they went together surprisingly well.\n\nFor brunch, I ordered the California Benedict -- avocado, asparagus, and a poached egg atop an english muffin, covered with a chile-spiced hollandaise sauce.  It was quite good -- I thought the little zip in the sauce complimented the eggs nicely, and helped to engage the palate more.  \n\nI was told that the crab cake sandwich and the salad with egg were delicious as well.  \n\nAll told, we had a great meal -- the only complaint I have was that they did not serve all of the entrees at the same time (although the delay was not long, it did serve to make the eggs Benedict a little lukewarm by the time we all started eating).\n\nAnyway, to sum up, the atmosphere was nice, the prices reasonable, the service generally good (and always pleasant), and the food delicious -- I will definitely return here when I come to Champaign again!",4

review_261167,restaurant,"Breakfast eaters, look to other reviews because someone's Best Burgers of Las Vegas list pointed the way here, specifying the cheeseburger with Cincy chili, and that's the find. The burger itself is fine, indifferent, no worse than a thousand others of its ilk. But the chili. These folks get the Cincinnati approach. Tweaked with unsweetened chocolate and a bit of cinnamon (but replete with more standard fare like cumin, paprika, garlic and tomato sauce) it's a regional style that if you suspend any constitutionally held ideas of what chili ought to be, is really quite delightful. In Ohio (and across the river in Kentucky) you can have it 3-Way, 4-Way or 5-Way with spaghetti and the chili being the one and two base and finely grated Cheddar, onions and beans being three through five, depending on how you like it. Works the same here at Egg Works. This stuff is hard to come by out west, (a few years ago some guy tried to open a Skyline imitation buried in a shopfront hole in the wall on Van Nuys Blvd and folded in flash) and if you're curious to open your mind and palate to chili adventures, this is way easier than flying into CVG. That said, here's a caution for all cases: don't go anywhere expecting the absolutely uncontested best thing you've ever eaten. Take it for what it is, simple, enjoyable and somewhat different from what you're probably used to and your experience (and life) will be just a tiny bit more pleasant. Enjoy.",3
review_504570,restaurant,I used to come here a lot. The food was great and the service was always nice. Recently however they started charging you for water ... This is the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard. They make enough money from the public from their expensive food that it is crazy to me that they would charge for water..!!! Needless to say I will not be going back.,0
review_110557,restaurant,"I used to work at a place where we would sometimes get free pizza from them and every single time, the pizza was disgusting, and every time, I had heartburn and felt ill after eating.\n\nPeople, the pizza here is just plain bad.  You've been warned.",0

Iced tea dispenser, no lid with bugs floating around at service of the iced tea. I brought to their attention. They said. \""Oh don't drink tea then\"" disgusting. Not recommended. Food was inedible after that. GROSS!'nn",0
review_374784,restaurant,I have been coming here for years. The owners a great people and seem to remember everything. I'm from a really small town in ohio and this place reminds me of home. The food is always good and there is a ton on your plate. I always get a ham and cheese omelet with an English muffin. Although a friend of mine got the French toast and i thought about stealing it. Great hidden gem. I will continue to be a regular here. \n\nTry the pancake challenge if your man enough.,3
review_504081,restaurant,"Wow, like going to China while staying in Madison. We were the only Westerners eating there on a recent weekend evening after a Badgers game, but it was full!

review_145956,restaurant,"I had a Groupon so I decided to stop by and have lunch. The service was pretty good. Attentive and knowledgeable. My food came out amazingly quick which was awesome. As for the food, everything was good. Sadly that's about as far as I can go with it. The salsa for the chips was watery. No onion, tomato or much of anything to be honest. When it came to the guacamole... it seemed like it had been put through a blender. Perhaps I like my guacamole and salsa on the chunky side so to each their own. The chicken mole was once again good but not great. For fifteen dollars a person I would rather eat like a king at a mom and pop Mexican restaurant where there's a little more grease and a lot more flavor.\n\nOverall I feel like this is a very refined (bland) Mexican restaurant. Their food is good but by no means amazing. Then again a lot of people tell me how delicious Robertos is... So I guess if that passes for authentic Mexican to some people then I can definitely see how people would be blown away by this place.",2

review_76440,restaurant,"What was supposed to be Pad Thai ended up being some bland noodles drowned in a big mess of bean sprouts and tofu and may be oyser sauce. Fishy! more chum than Pad Thai. Chicken Noodle dish was mushy and reeked of rancidity and fish stock as well. Food order came in after no more than 2 minutes of placing the order. I really was wondering if he mixed our order with someone else's. Anyway, gave the usual tip because waitress was pleasent but not going back!",1

The first thing I noticed was the baked potato was covered in grease. It had been fried, whole. I don't know if it was baked first or just cooked that way & called baked. If was gross! The next thing I realized, the baby back ribs were fried also & then some bar-b-q sauce added on top. I don't know anyone that cooks ribs that way. I will never go back. I feel nauseous just thinking about it.",0
review_483562,restaurant,"Our much anticipated first visit to Justin Becketts new restaurant turned out to be our last.  Arriving at just before 7 with 2 friends on a Wednesday, the only available seating according to the hostess was outside, at the bar, at the communal table even though there were several emp0ty 4 tops in the dining room and no one waiting.  We choose the patio which was surprsingly pleasant considering its a few yards away from busy Indian School Rd. After many minutes we were finally greeted by a waiter that we never saw again, Another long interval passes and finally a different waiter informs us he will be serving us now.  We give our drink order and after another 10 minutes I have to flag him down too find out where my drink is and he tells me i didnt order one then says \""oh yeah I forgot\"". Finally 35 minutes after being seated I get a drink. We order several apps, salads nd soups to share .  Our observations.  The roasted beets were great, perfectly cooked and seasoned, the salmon was tasty and came with nice condiments the wedge salad was limp and had an odd metallic aftertaste, the gazpacho was delicious, perfectly seasoned and well balanced and the roasted pepper soup was also a hit.  The spatzel was cold, greasy and flavorless.  For dessert we had to try the bacon smores and were routinely disappointed.  The marshmellow was unspreadable, the graham crackers were out of a box and overal it didnt come together.  The fig and pecan pie fared much better with a well balanced filling off set by the cream cheese ice cream. The coffee was terrific.\\\n\nThroughout, the service was, choppy, sporadic and unattentive.  There was no attempt to rectify the situation, apologize, or even acknowledge the problems.  A simple comment saying we apologize for the difficulties, please come back and give us another chance would have left us feeling much better about the whole experience but alas, no comment came.\n\nWith the abundace of great restaurants who care about the service they provide and offer a menu consistently creative and high caliber I don't know why anyone would go here.  Restaurants are not doing you a favor serving you and you shouldn't be treated as such.",1
review_207493,restaurant,"I wish I could give this a 3.5!  It's a wonderful place for a quick lunch - but this is not a place I would frequent for dinner due to atmosphere and menu choices, hence the lower rating.  If you're a fan of the walk up and order establishments, this would be a prime contender.  Now for the food!  I'm not a huge fan of their pizzas.  They taste great with gourmet ingredients - thin crust, but there are so many other pizza joints I would suggest first.  What I do love and highly suggest are their salads.  I think my favorite would have to be the caprese, which is actually a standard salad with lettuce, pieces of tomato and fresh mozzarella mixed in, an amazing balsamic vinaigrette, and to top it off... lightly crunchy buttered/oiled croutons made from their fresh bread.  \n\nMy second choice salad is the chicken/gorgonzola/tomato/pine nut one.  Fresh light dressing makes this a summer time delight.  \n\nTheir bruschetta is also great, but expect them to be small in portion, very individual, not shareable as an appetizer really.  Great flavors!\n\nPaninis and pasta also are a large portion of the menu, but alas, I have not tried any of these yet!\n\nIn all, a great place to grab a quick bite with good food aimed to please.  If you're familiar with restaurants like Noodles n Co or Cosi, this is right in line.  Not quite what I expected from a FOX creation, but yummy.\n\np.s. their triple chocolate cookies (plain cookie dough, dark, milk, white chips) are way worth $1 more.  Make sure to take advantage of them because I am addicted even though I don't really love chocolate!",3
review_368646,restaurant,"Well that was a disappointment. We used to dine here often when they first opened. Then we ventured off to other options. (Dave's) The service was always great. Well it has changed. We are Passport members and received a coupon for a Cheeseburger & beer for $10 on Tax Tuesday only. The husband called ahead and asked if we could use the coupons for our non-drinking members but still have the beers for us. He was assured they were flexible with coupon. The fine print said: one coupon per person. So after a 20 minute wait to sit, our waitress arrives and tells us no that won't work with the coupons. We order drinks and try not be annoyed. We decide on three cheeseburgers and pizza. Then the waitress returns (without the drinks) and says the manager said the coupon deal will work. Oh well we've decided differently. So we order and wait for our beers.....................................................................and wait..............................................................oh here they are. Warm. No apology just 'here you go'. Then we wait..................................................................................................and get our dinner. The WAITRESS realizes we have no utensils or napkins. So we wait.............................................but I see some on a clean table inside, I walk in and take them off the table. As I'm walking out I run into her she says \""oh, sorry\"". So I finally dig in and it's so blah, we ordering the beef medium and it was overcooked very charred on the outside with a slice of cheddar, a bit of shredded lettuce, slice of tomato, on a big bun. I had garlic fries as they used to be so good. These were cold, greasy and mushy. The waitress never came by to ask how the meal was. But she finally showed up and stated \""you are welcome to one more beer would you like it\""? Yes, and then we ............you guessed it! WAIT..........................................................................................................................................................................................Sigh. She finally brought it and it was a least cold this time. Then we were done and yes, we waited and waited and waited for the check. Until we got up and could have left but we went inside and ....waited. The I think the manager went and found it for us. So dear waitress, we are good tippers even for unspecial service but never, never for complete disregard for any customer service. \nI can't see us going back any time in the near future.",1
review_483328,restaurant,"If you're dying to try Ninfa's in Glendale (In the old \""North\"" restaurant building next to AJ's - and *not* recommended btw) - then I'd say go visit soon - I can't see any way how they can remain in business with the price points they desire and the portion sizes they serve.\n  My family and I were able to try them out this past Thursday for dinner during a 50% off promotion. The restaurant was maybe 20% capacity with lots of waitstaff available. On the walk back to our seat, we were able to walk past many other diners and see not only the dishes they ordered, but the looks on their faces as their food arrived and/or they ate. Eek. \n   When the 'diablo shrimp tacos' i ordered arrived, I was surprised at how small the plates were, but I wasn't that hungry anyway, so no big deal. While the dish came with rice and beans, I was able to see why the plates our meals arrived on were so small: Any larger and the approx 3 tablespoons of cold, tasteless yellow-colored rice and 2 tablespoons of cold beans that accompanied the meals would have spilled over the edge of the plate.\n   The shrimp tacos themselves were completely underwhelming. While the dish was indeed advertised as \""shrimp tacos\"" - Ninfas used a single shrimp (40-60 count size at most)  and - incredibly - cut this into 3 pieces for use in the taco. It was enough for maybe 1 bite with shrimp, and 4 bites without. My meal at half price was almost a ripoff of colossal proportions. Consider the regular menu prices are regularly  50% more, and you'll get an idea of the audacity of this place. \n   As for my drink, I've never met a Michelada I didn't like. Some are great; most are glorious! But: I've never had one that was horrible until the one at Ninfas. This was my first and only Michelada in 49 years I was simply unable to drink. The Pacifico beer that accompanied it however was just wonderful :-)\n  I'd comment on the other dishes we had, but they are variations on the theme above. Their chips and sauce were OK; maybe if they had a happy hour (which they don't ) I could maybe say something nice like \""they might be OK for beers\"", but the taste of the food there seems chain-store average (are they a chain? This would explain alot) and at 50% off I felt the prices were at/over full retail for value received. \n   Hope it helps amigos. This place needs some love (snif!).",0

review_581066,restaurant,"$27 for lunch for 2 adults and 2 kids?  Seems a little pricey!  I will say DITTO to everything everyone else has to say here.\n\nWe were greeted when we went in the door.  The hostess gave us a TOUR.  We were given cards.  I've got to say that if you need to \""EXPLAIN\"" how to eat at a restaurant, you're going to drive people away.   When she was done, she said \""if you decide to stay...\""  I thought that was a strange remark, that's BAD SALES, there should NEVER be a reason for someone to walk in and walk out.\n\nIt took quite awhile for us to FIGURE out what to do.  My little one was about ready to explode because all she wanted was mac-n-cheese and some bread and we couldn't find it. \n\nI decided to get the salad bar COMBO.  I went there and had to wait for someone to set a tray for me.  I didn't understand what the \""sides were\"".  Is a side, the brocolli salad, is it pasta?  I don't know nothing was labeled.  I assumed the Broccoli salad was a side so I filled my side bowl with it.  let me tell you, I FILLED IT because there's no seconds in this salad bar.\n\nMy daughter and wife each got pasta.  2 choices by they way.  Like it would be hard to develop a couple of different sauces?  The hostess said the pasta is \""a huge\"" bowlful.  When it came out it was on a 10 inch plate and there was at least 2 inches on either side with no pasta .  I asked a manager, \""Is this a $6 plate of pasta?\""  He said that it was a little light and gladly had the \""chef\"" remake it.\n\nOh if you're going to remodel a restaurant.  Rule number 1 is replace the dingy old carpet.  I can't believe they left that in there.  They could have put a nice vinyl (wood) down for next to nothing and it would have really spruced up the place!\n\nWe usually go to Sweet Tomatoes about once or twice a month.  With the \""FAMILY\"" coupon it costs us $20 for dinner.  I know that's a little on the cheap side, I'd probably even be willing to pay $25 for the same thing.  The old place is such a good value when you have 2 little kids who don't eat much. \n\nI really hope they take these reviews to heart before they go and convert all the Sweet Tomatoes in the valley  to this new format.  I probably won't be going back.  There's much better places to go to for the money.  Really test this concept for 6-12 months before investing more.  As I see it right now 74% of the these reviews are 3 stars or less.  We already lost SouperSalad, now Sweet Tomatoes.  I'll have to start eating at Golden Corral.  YUK!!!",1
review_446599,restaurant,"I've decided to up the rating of this place to 3 stars because I went back for a second try. (it was close to work)  This time the burger actually had juices left.

review_425098,restaurant,"Braddock is your typical hotel restaurant in a nice downtown hotel.  Very nicely decorated with good service but the food is a bit overpriced for what you pay.  We ate here several times while staying at the Renaissance over the weekend since it's conveniently located inside the hotel.\n\nThe breakfast buffet here is $15/person and does not quite worth its value.  It's basically $15 for a continental breakfast with some hot items (eggs, bacon).  Lunch/dinner here is similar to your average American restaurant with burgers and sandwiches.  The service though is great and our waitress was very attentive to our needs.  For a hotel restaurant in a city downtown, expect the typical American grill.  Within walking distances are many more options so try something different unless you're looking for the convenience of a hotel restaurant.",2

Looking at the gorgeous red rocks while dining is a 5 star experience.\nIt was a fine meal to have before heading out on a Pink Jeep Tour!

review_585792,restaurant,"I went to this restaurant on Saturday for lunch with the BF and it was just ok. We didn't have to wait too long due to getting a high top bar seat, but the wait felt long because the 'fire wall', while cool looking, was very warm. We sat down and waited a bit before being acknowledged. We got a waitress who told us she was in training, but there wasn't anyone around training her...that's pretty odd. It was obvious that she was new because she was awkward and left our waters empty for long periods of time...not awesome. As far as the food, it was alright, but it wasn't as good as I would hope for a GR restaurant and for the price. I got the hell's kitchen burger plus duck bacon. The bacon was good, would definitely have it again, but the burger was assembled poorly making it hard to bite and making the bun fall apart....I mean, they put half an avocado in the middle of the bun, not spread out thin, and it was popping out all over the place...not awesome, also the chili peppers were slimy and also slid out of the bun leaving me with a mess. The flavor was decent, spicy, but not as flavorful as I hoped. The BF got the american burger and said it was fine, but nothing special. We also shared the pork bao buns and it was ok, but the pork belly needed to be cooked longer... it was hard to bite due to it being tough still, but the flavors were good. We finished with the sticky toffee pudding pops. Now, we had the sticky toffee pudding at GR steak, so maybe that ruined it for us cuz that was so damn good, but these were just ok. I don't get the pop thing, it made it hard to eat and I didn't like having to eat a huge chunk of the ice cream with no cake trying to get through the first layer. The flavor was fine, but ditch the pop....just serve the pudding from GR steak please! Overall, I liked this place better than Holstein's, but it still isn't a place I'd wait in line for.",2

The variety is limited, although they have many creative rolls - they all amount to the same few ingredients-crab mix, fried eel, shrimp, salmon.\n\nAlso, a warning. We used a restaurant.com certificate. The fine print includes18% gratuity. No big deal... IF there is a wait staff!! To be charged 18% for ordering at the counter ?!?

review_59424,restaurant,Ok...so after viewing their food network episode I tried them as it is near my home.  From a service standpoint the staff were very friendly and attentive and focused on using the customers' name which I thought was a nice touch.   I ordered take out and the food was ready on time.   So why only 3 stars?   It was the food...\nI ordered a small Boston white pizza that comes with clams.  Unfortunately rather than using fresh clams and mincing them as they do on the east coast the clams were canned and sparsely used.   On the plus side the cheese combination was tasty and I enjoyed the thin crust but it would have benefited by cooking in their oven another five minutes.   \nI also tried their eggplant sicilian style.   This dish is awesome!   Well done.  It is not breaded or fried rather nicely nestled in tomato sauce and cheese and baked to a light consistency.   This is a dish I would definitely order again.   It came with a small side salad that was simply ok.\nI ordered a cannoli for desert.   Great crunchy shell however the ricotta filling was overly sweeten ..not the best.    \nIt appears that this place excels at their baked pasta and entree options but needs some improvement on their pizza and side options.\nOverall. ..I would try again and hope it will be better.,2

review_150384,restaurant,"Union Grill is one of the better options on S. Craig.  I've been here several times, the latest being a week ago.  On my most recent trip, I ordered the turkey Devonshire, based on the comments of other reviewers, and since I'm always keen to try local specialities.  Although it was filling, I found it a bit bland in flavor.  My dining companion ordered the \""barbecue\"" chicken (read: roast chicken with barbecue sauce) with waffle fries, both of which were good.  During past visits, I've ordered the church pierogies, which are a good specimen of the dish for PGH (I've heard that they get them from a local church, though I can't vouch for it), and come with a generous helping of sour cream and caramelized onions on top.  Though I've never personally ordered from it, they have a $10 wine list, which my labmate tells me contains wines that sell for at least twice that at the upscale bars in PGH.  (I'll have to try it next time I return.)  Service is generally good, and I like the atmosphere.  (Try to get one of the outdoor tables if the weather's nice!)  3.5 stars.",2

review_35969,restaurant,"Pizza doesn't thril me, but this Streets of New York is better than most. The ham and pineapple thin crust was close to perfect (but canadian bacon costs twice as much as ham??). It did suffer a bit from \""underdone middle\"", like so many thin crusts do. Overall, a pizza I'd eat again.\n\nAlong with the pizza, they gave us (and everybody else, apparently) some bread \""chunks\"" with marinara. Each was a bite-sized piece of crust, baked and dusted with parmesan (I think). They tasted good, but I wish they had asked if we wanted it, since our basket pretty much went to waste.\n\nThe interior is nicely decorated, not too cramped and not too overly filled with pictures and wall objects selected carefully by corporate marketing specialists. The waitress was patient with our inability to decide on a pizza, and she was definitely attentive to our needs throughout the meal.",2
review_232949,restaurant,"My husband and I came here for a quick lunch. When we arrived there was a line even though there were empty tables around. From a quick look the restaurant was understaffed.  \nWe ordered the lunch special dynamite California roll and eel avocado roll and pork katsu. The eel avocado was a good deal only $5 and it was a more affordable lunch size version of the dragon roll. The sushi was delicious the best I've had in Arizona so far however the service was toooo slow.\n\nI had to go pick up chopsticks because servers were nowhere always busy ringing up the register. The only time they came to the table after we took our orders was to give and pick up the check. I really enjoyed the food, but the service needs to improve and they need to clean the tables because they were sticky ....",2
review_206027,restaurant,"Stopped in here for lunch and got the Cucumber Sunomo, Yellowtail Jalapeno and the Tuna Special. All were very delicious and fresh, for being a Monday.  These are off the modern sashimi section, so no bed of rice.\n\nEach had a little spice and crunch which complimented each other well.  The meal did not come with Wasabi and Ginger, so we needed to request that.  After trying one with the typical mix, I now know why they weren't served with our meal.  They were better without.\n\nIf in the area of Crystals, give them a try, it won't disappoint.",3
review_290772,restaurant,"The kids decided this was \""Meh-xican\"" food. I have to agree that it was just OK.

I don't know if they've gotten complaints and default to a mild version for the tourists, but ours was little more than tomato sauce with a few onions in it.\n\nOn the plus side, the kids absolutely LOVED their cheese crisps.",2

review_364456,restaurant,"I've come  to notice that the places with the best god are the little hole in the wall spots. My biz partner and I lucked up when we yelped this place to eat before we hit the road for a 6 hr trip. As soon as we walked in a older, heavy set African American man was sitting behind the counter. He appeared to be chewing something in his mouth and had that cliche southern style look. I loved it, we ordered the catfish and cod with fried shrimp on side. I must say they were delicious. Good service with good food always speaks volumes in my book.  I'm not sure if the fried fish cooked by African American people was so good because they're great cold or because I'm biased because it's Black history month. Never the less, two thumbs up.",4
review_405675,restaurant,"It had long been a dream of The Rob to open his very open Cheba Hut near GCC.  When we recently found out that someone had beaten him to it, he was a bit sad but also excited for the now close proximity of his favorite herbal-themed eatery.  This location is located in a strip mall along with a Circle K, tattoo parlor and Trails.  (If you're familiar with the area, Trails took over the large space once occupied by the nudie bar and Cheba Hut took over the old Trails space.)\n\nWhether you're a big ol' stoner or a sober square like myself you'll enjoy the tasty sandwiches with funny names.  We even took The Rob's parents for a visit so that his conservative, vegetarian mom and his formerly-tie-die-wearing dad could enjoy the goodness, which they most certainly did.\n\nOnly complaints: \n1) Pepsi products instead of Coke\n2) As stated before, the toasting does take a little while, so you have to wait a little bit for them to bring your sandwich to the topping bar.\n3) Lacking in chip selection.  I mean, c'mon, you run an establishment themed around the chronic and you don't offer BAKED chips?",3

review_272897,restaurant,"I have, since writing the original review of this place, tried many Thai restaurants including another Archi's. Archi's has been cemented as my favorite Thai place so far. \n\nThe real meat of this update is as follows.\n\nI was pondering ordering an 8 or 9 spiciness the next time I came here according to my last review. I have long since discovered that if you convince them you really want it spicy, you just order a number higher than 10. Turns out they have a secret spiciness scale that goes up to 30.\n\nBe warned! The Archi's in Summerlin will give me a 30-spicy dish that is edible and delicious. This Archi's I can not eat past a 20. A 25 was ridiculous. I dare not venture to 30. However, if you are a fan of spicy food this will definitely get you what you're looking for.",4
review_487360,restaurant,"DISSAPPOINTED!  Only reason for 2 stars is the Tuna Tartare. Being a seafood fanatic, Lakeside was below average. The Chilled Seafood tower included crab legs, half shell, oysters, shrimp and lobster tail. The crab legs had a weird taste, the lobster tail was OK, long story short the shrimp was the only edible thing on tower. We ordered the blue lobster as entree and if the lobster itself  was not known to be tender, it wouldn't excite your taste buds. The lobster macaroni and cheese--HORRIBLE. Do not recommend this place. If you want good seafood check out American Fish at Aria",1
review_39179,restaurant,"It drives me nuts how every time I order a taco or burrito without the sauce, they still go right ahead and put the sauce on it.  Not some of the time, or most of the time, but every single time.  Sometimes, with the tacos, they even cover it up with extra cabbage or lettuce on top so I don't see it until I get home.  For that reason, I usually order the chicken or steak street tacos since they don't come with that gross white sauce that they put all over their seafood items.  But every once in a while I feel like a shrimp or fish taco and invariably when I get home with my takeout and taste my first bite, I realize that they put the d#!@ sauce on there.  I don't like tarter sauce or mayo or any of those creamy sauces.  I don't know why they put it on there in the first place since they have the yummy salsas for you to add to your food to your own liking.  Which leads me to another complaint that I have.  The last few times I have been to this Rubio's, they are out of the spicy carrots.  Nothing left in the container except jalepenos and liquid.  And one time I got some of the chopped onion and I could tell after one bite that it had gone bad.  A little more attention to the condiments, please!\n\nGet it together guys, or I will stop coming here. Even though it really convenient, if I can't eat my food when I get takeout or have to wait around while you make it twice when dining in, then why would I want to return?",1
review_530669,restaurant,"I drive past US Egg every day and always wanted to try it. Finally got the chance to stop by this weekend. The food was spectacular and the service even more so.

review_560986,restaurant,"I don't like it when I have to give less than five stars to a place that I know it has potential but they haven't realized how to make it work and this the case for this small restaurant. It is a family owned business which I know it has good cooks, most of the time two ladies. However, I suspect sometimes they live young people in charge of the kitchen and that's when things start to fall apart. They don't cook the food with love and care so that makes this place either a big hit or a big miss. I have been there many times, either to pick up or dine in so I have experienced both. Besides, most of the time you place an order over the phone they rush you, I know there is a language barrier but at least they could listen and not keep saying \""anything else?\""after each word you say. \n\nI love their green curry with chicken, it comes with Thai eggplant, ginger, basil, coconut milk and my favorite butternut squash, it screams comfort food and it really makes my tummy happy and not to say sweaty! You have to specify how spicy you want it but even I always ask for mild it still has a kick, I don't mind, but I just wanted you to be aware of that. Also, their crispy egg rolls and crab Rangoon are good, specially the latter, they keep their crunchiness for a long time which impress me and the cream cheese filling has a nice delicate flavor with a hint of chives. My hubby gets their chili fried fish (it's a whole one) with a sweet and spicy sauce and it is yummy, it has complex but interesting flavors with herbs like mint.",2

review_480163,restaurant,"This is a nice little place that does a good job. I had the lunch special which consists of a sandwich, pita chips, and a small drink for around $5.75. The price is right! Their bread is great! It's like a soft ciabatta bread and it tastes homemade. Overall, this is a really good little place and I would reccomend it;  but there are a few problems that I saw.\n\n1. They charge you for putting cheese on your sandwich. It's a deli sandwich! I appreciate the low prices, but give me a break. Throw a slice of swiss on it.\n\n2. It comes with their homemade pita chips that are actually pretty good, but they are all broken little peices and you only get three or four of those broken little peices. \n\n3. No deli mustard, honey mustard, or any other tangy sauce that could \""kick it up a notch.\"" Maybe they are coming later, but a little deli mustard at a sandwich place doesn't seem to be asking for too much.",2

review_284737,restaurant,"Maybe my expectations were too high after last years rave reviews, or perhaps the business has gotten so confidant that their patrons would go back no matter what. This place has severely disappointed my gf and me on our recent visit this winter.\n\nWe got there and it is busy as usual since it was lunch time. Servers seemed stressed and distracted, but I won't rail them for that. We sat down and got our menus and it took forever to take our order (10-15 min). We ordered a Tom yum noodle soup and sticky rice. Note that we came in first and got our order down first in front of three other groups who sat down after us, yet they got their food first and ours arrived last after 10-15 min. Maybe they treat their regulars or Thai people better??? \n\nSo my Tom yum noodle soup was just what I expected, but the sticky rice was horrible. First of all sticky rice should be soft and easily chewable, but our sticky rice was hard to chew and majority of it still had rice uncooked!! Raw rice in our dessert? Wtf! So my gf went to the cashier to ask about it, and her response was \""no that's how it is supposed to be\"" in a rude tone. I'm sorry, but we have had sticky rice from many Thai places and I have friends who are Thai that I have asked and they all say that it is not supposed to be raw! \n\nServers are completely incompetent and rude. Total disappointment especially after our first few visits. Maybe they should hire that girl who first helped us and made this place our first thing to visit when we go to Vegas.",0

review_185043,restaurant,"Atmosphere:  Very nice, classy place, clean.  Soft jazz playing in the background.  I would recommend this place for a low-key weeknight.  \n\nService:  No one there to greet at check-in, I believe hostesses were helping clear tables.  Our server stepped up to the plate and provided amazing service.  Went out of his way to make this a great experience. The gentlemen wait staff were very attentive and on their game.  \n\nFood:  It is as described.  Diver Scallops were an amazing size.  The sauce was well seasoned, The pasta al dente.  \n\nI tried my husband's Filet Mignon, it was well prepared and a generous portion.  He did not leave one crumb on his plate.  \n\nI tried my daughter's Bow Tie Boa chicken, it was also very well done and a generous portion.  \n\nMimosas:  Very well done, the way they should taste. \n\nBread and sauce dip:  It is not cottage cheese folks.  I believe it is a fontina or marscapone; some type of Italian cheese mixture.  Different.  The bread, I cannot tell if it was home baked, but it was fresh and soft.  It was not warm when we got it, but rather on the cold side. I am not sure if this is how it was supposed to be but we finished it off. \n \nOverall:  Very nice.  Just a couple of things would send this over the top to a 5 star:  1.)  I felt the wait staff could have used one extra hand this busy Mother's Day and 2.)  My Linguini was cold upon arrival.  3.)  The butter cake is amazing, but with the $8.50 price tag, I felt it could have been a bit more generous in size.  Also the fruits around the side I felt were skimpy, could have used a few more.  \n\nIt's a cute little place and rates good.",3
review_158002,restaurant,"Came here for my college graduation.  My parents remember coming here 25 years ago and having an amazing Prime Rib.  Well much to our dismay they ran out of prime rib at 7:30 pm.  Anyway, we got the German dishes that took literally 2 HOURS + to come to our table and our waitress kept apologizing.  The food was HORRID, NO FLAVOR at all and was almost cold.  I can eat anything and this had no flavor!! Besides that, we complained to the waitress only to get that they would give us free dessert for the wait/it being cold.  We left the food (we never leave food at a restaurant) and took the desserts to go.  The next day, I tried the dessert- again TERRIBLE and threw it away.  Basically, NEVER COME HERE FOR FOOD!",0
review_264368,restaurant,"Pricey but nothing unexpected for the strip. LOVE the convenience of having valet right outside the restaurant since the far parking is the main reason I loathe going to Caesars. \n\nStarted out w a great bread basket. We split the veggie chopped salad which was surprisingly good and huge. Stone crab bisque was disappointingly ordinary but I really liked that they brought out the bowl with crab and veggies, then added the bisque tableside. Genius way to make sure everybody gets the same amount of crab. \n\nWe shared the steak sandwich - unexpectedly 3 little sliders vs 1 regular sandwich. Thick slices of tender medium rare steak. Maybe not worth $17 but it was damn good. We also shared the 8oz filet with sides - super fresh tasting charred sweet corn, sauteed broccolini and mac & cheese. Perfect char and seasoning on the steak but sides were just average, I wouldn't say any were really worth the calories or $  \n\nNo time for dessert since we were headed to absinthe but the menu looked great. The place was packed for a Thursday, service was pretty good although a waiter did shoulder check me on our way out without an excuse me, but fuckit. \n\nBill for 3 including a bottle of wine was $160 before tip.

review_78900,restaurant,"We were sat quickly but then there was a slight delay in our waitress coming for our drink orders but I won't complain about that since my wife had to use the restroom anyway. The service overall was good, tho a little slow on bringing the food out. Which very likely could be the kitchens fault. The main issue with this place was the food. My sons burger was cooked well past well done and he wouldn't eat it. An 8 year old that usually eats well took about three bites and said he couldn't eat it. My wife ordered the Parmesan Crusted Chicken which was cooked nicely but it was pretty bland. I've had this dish at TGI Fridays before and this was subpar for them. I ordered the French Dip with no onions. Of course it came out with onions but no horseradish sauce. I'm not one to send it back (Ive seen the movie Waiting lol) so I picked off the onion and went on. The kicker was my Au Jus cup was cemented to the plate. I picked up the entire plate, food and all by lifting just the cup. How does this happen you ask? Well it was glued down with the cheese that should have been on my sandwich, unless that was cheese from the last patron lol. I probably shouldn't laugh at that.\nThe only bright spot was our server. She was a little slow in things that came from the kitchen and seemed spread out across the restaurant. But she kept the smile and was very friendly. \nThey're so many other great food choices in that area that there is absolutely no reason not to avoid this place and go somewhere with more passion for the food coming out of the kitchen.",1

review_606289,restaurant,"This location has been open for a couple months, but this was the first time we were able to go for lunch. This restaurant has the fancy Ferrari designed Coca Cola machine so I indulged in a Cherry Coke. We decided to share an order of nachos, tostada style, and an order of grilled mahi mahi tacos. The tacos turned out to be one in the case of the fish option, but our server insisted it would be enough food. Our server and the others seemed very young and not supervised, but were all very smiley and all kept busy even though the restaurant was quiet. \nThe food came out very quickly and was really good! The taco was my preference, I will totally order it again. A fresh flour tortilla, slightly crisper and loaded with two small tender mahi filets, cabbage, chipotle cream, salsa cruda. It was so delicious I almost couldn't stop eating at the halfway mark! The nachos were very good as well, loaded with seasoned beef, refried beans, Pico de gallo, queso and shredded cheeses, sour cream, guacamole, lettuce, fried jalapenos. \nI highly recommend this place for quick lunch or late bar bites.

I ordered the usual #1 double-double with grilled onions and a lemonade. I pretty much inhaled it and didn't speak to anyone for the 5 minutes it took me to eat it. They got our order right even when we had 7 people to order for and some of us ordered it with grilled onions, regular onions, no lettuce, only tomato, yada, yada, yada. Good job! Always a pleasure and always a necessity when visiting. \n\nThe great thing about this location is that it is right next to their brand store. My pops bought me an In-N-Out beach towel and my husband picked up a shirt on sale.

review_564493,restaurant,"Three strikes and I'm afraid you're out. I won't be dining here again after tonight. The first time I ate here (a little less than a year ago) and got poor service I thought it was a fluke. The food wasn't great either but the atmosphere was excellent so I wrote it off. The second time I ate here (this summer) the service was mediocre at best and the food was worse than the first time. We also got seated in a huge room with no windows and where there wasn't a single other diner in sight despite it being the middle of the day. Lots of time had passed between my first two visits so it wasn't as though I had been anticipating a bad experience or anything. Months later, tonight, I visited The Free House a third time. This time the appetizers, main dish, and service were pretty unremarkable. The lettuce rolls were not rolls at all -- the plate consisted of an ice cream sized scoop of filling that resembled something akin to pink dog food and a dozen or so puny scraps of lettuce. I guess we were meant to assemble the rolls ourselves. My dinner mates (a strapping teenager accustomed to eating just about anything and a grown man with a healthy appetite after working all afternoon on a farm) exhibited no interest in that dish and ultimately we sent that plate back. The waitress expressed no disappointment, nor did she offer to bring out anything different. To her credit the appetizer did not appear on our bill but one can only wonder how routine that may be given that it produced no reaction whatsoever from our server. After we were served our fish tacos and asked how the first few bites were, our waitress again had no reaction (not one word, in fact) when I expressed my disappointment. The fish tacos (which both my partner and I ordered) consisted of little more than reheated, mushy, breaded fish strips with an excessive amount of thousand island dressing zigzagged across the top. Blech. I was able to get one of the three down despite not having had lunch today. In sum, while this restaurant exhibits some lovely exposed brick, wood panelling, a couple of nice bar areas, and a pleasant semi-covered outdoor eating area, the food and service certainly leave much to be desired.",1

review_37804,restaurant,"After reading multiple Yelp reviews on this business, I decided to come here for the greatest hits: Pizza muffins, Calzones and Antipasto salad.\n\nI thought the pizza muffins were interesting and a great alternative to bread sticks or garlic bread. They were loaded with TONS of sausage and ham and came with 2 different dipping sauces. Although a little greasy and re-heated, I appreciated the novelty factor.\n\nOn to the entrees, the small Antipasto salad (5.99) was absolutely filling for a one person meal. I didn't find it any different from any Antipasto salad I have tried before, but I think people love it for the dressing - which had flavor but A LOT of oil (more than half of the total dressing). The ingredients were fresh but there is nothing out of this world about iceberg lettuce and dry mozzarella. \n\nThe calzone was larger than a newborn baby and hotter than Phoenix in the summertime. Although the corners are mostly (if not all) bread the taste was very good and overloaded with tasty insides. The spinach ham combo my friend ordered was pretty satisfying and this meal could easily be split in 2 for tasty leftovers... if you can stop eating.\n\nI found the teenage staff to be friendly and cheery but the bathroom needs massive help. Only one stall and really unpleasant smells, the female employee who had just left the bathroom as I entered left wet paper towels on the handles of both exit doors... covering the entire area for me to hold on to and pull. Just.... disgusting, especially from an employee who should be trying to keep the establishment clean and good looking.\n\nAll in all, good but not great. Its pretty affordable so if this is your price range, I think you can make it work and still have a tasty meal.",2
review_584361,restaurant,"Ok i had to try this place from the reviews it was a no brainer. I had the carne asada burrito. Food was solid but it wasnt the best i have ever had. It was good.I just moved here from los angeles and have been eating mexican food my whole life so all i can say is that in this town that there seems to be a shortage of quality food places and thats why people get blown away whenever something decent comes along. dont get me wrong this place was solid..fresh tortillas,lots of meat good quality meat too. The only thing i would say is that there is only 1 man working there i presume he is the owner,but I mean come on YOU NEED HELP...you cant do it all yourself it's not efficient for you or the customers. Im assuming he does this either because he is looking for help or he doesent want to pay for help.In any event he could definitely increase his sales with some assistance.Otherwise a solid choice for mexican food.",3
review_628637,restaurant,"Excellent service. Staff was really nice and friendly and they support the military( gave 20% discount for military off their already cheap prices). I would come here again! Their crust isn't necessarily the best I've had but, based on how it looked out of the oven, it was pretty damn good and unique. They give a heavy portion of sauce, which I like, so if you're not big on sauce order light on the sauce. Overall the sauce is very good. All in all I say it's the best pizza around the Aliante area, so pop in and give it a try. I'll definitely be back!",3

review_489988,restaurant,"Burger for the boys!  How about gourmet burgers?  Even better.  Holstein is located near the East tower elevators in Cosmo.  Right across Marquee nightclub.  \n\nMany yelpers recommended the \""Gold Standard,\""  and with that name, I went for it.  After sinking my teeth into the dry aged sirloin burger, a sudden disappointment hit me.  I might've gotten a little too much goat cheese in the first bite, so went for a second bite.  No!  It can't be.  The Gold Standard did not meet my standard for a burger.  Oversalted and didn't go well with the goat cheese.  Yes, I like goat cheese too.  \n\nIt's okay though!! There's crispy pork burns on the table.  My first pork bun was at Ippudo in NYC.  I understood the hype within seconds and ordered a second.  The pork buns from Holsteins didn't let me relive that moment.  There was too much hoisin sauce, which made it overly salty.  Oh, the pork was also dry.  \n\nOur waiter was actually pretty nice.  However, the service was slow.  The restaurant was full and I saw him constantly filling orders, so I could sympathize.  I usually destroy my burgers and leave nothing but I just couldn't finish my burger and pork buns.  Salt was used very liberally.",1

Everything is so amazing that now when I go I just tell them to bring me anything on the menu.  Beet salad that is pretty close to Woflgang Pucks Spago beet salad, Shrimp and grits are delish (and I am a pretty strict judge of grits), short ribs that make you want to lick the plate, and oh the desserts.  Fig & Pecan pie with cream cheese ice cream will make you want to come back just to have dessert as the entree.",4

Do yourself a favor and do not order the fries with gravy...its tastier.,2

The hostess on April 11th (short gal, black hair pulled back in a braid) should not be a hostess! She was incredibly rude, her vague answers to our questions about seating, her body language suggested our arrival was annoying her or interrupting her day! After the confusion of where to sit, she forgot to send a server over, but 10 min later she came back and told us to MOVE tables ( even though she sat us there!). She didn't say it nicely either!

My boyfriend got a bowl og meatball marinara pasta for about $10 as well. The sauce looked watery and the taste was just okay. Nothing special. My pizza slice had way to much cheese for my liking. The Caesar salad however was fantastic, but then again, how hard is it to make a ceasar salad. Won't be returning",2
review_184450,restaurant,"Mediocre - neither here nor there.  \n\nA Vietnamese grilled chicken sandwich and a European roast beef (both on baguette).  May give this place another try if I am bored with just about every type of sandwich shop in town, but otherwise, I doubt I'd re-visit.  The grilled chicken contained very sub-standard chicken \""pieces\"" and wasn't very flavorful and the roast beef was almost too chewy and lacked flavor.  On the plus side, the baguette was authentic, fresh and delicious but that really isn't enough to carry the sandwich.",2

Lacked any smoke flavor and i had to drown the ribs in sauce to make it taste edible.

review_374421,restaurant,"Well this is my first less than flattering review. I bought some soup and it had large noodles that seemed to be the ones that stick to the top of the pot when you boil them, It wasn't cooked, it was still hard. But the cook didn't care. Well I do. 4 times I have been there and 4 times a problem. They need a cook that cares, because when she saw the uncooked noodle and served it to me, She mush have thought It didn't matter. well it did. Not a very good place to eat. They need to get rid of cooks that are not into their work. No wonder when I drive by it's usually empty tables. Sorry to have to communicate this, I tried and gave the benefit of the doubt. But after 4 fails. I won't be coming back. And get rid of the guy with the baseball cap and dirty t shirt hanging around the kitchen, that doesn't look good to a customer.",0
review_511731,restaurant,"Holy cow, I thought I had already written a review of this place! I've been coming to Los Jarochos ever since they opened (I was sad that the kabobs place closed though). I had read an article by local food critic Max Jacobson where he said he had really enjoyed the food. \n\nMy husband loves this place. So much so, that when I suggest we check out a new taco tand or head to an old favorite, he feels like he is cheating on the place. Really. When I come here I always order the tostadas de pollo, you can order individually or an order which comes with three. I always go for three, but really two are sufficient. Hubby gets a variety of tacos, lengua, birria, asada, etc. and he loves them all. \n\nThe reason I was compelled to write this review today is because we recently went and I was craving something other than tostadas. Hbby recommended a torta, which he sometimes gets and also loves. HOLY COW! I ordered a torta de asada and my goodness it was extraordinary. The meat had that special sazon that you get when eating food in Mexico and the bread was sooo good! I don't know what they do to it but I dare say it is the best torta in town. The only thing I've ordered and haven't liked were the shrimp empanadas, that had weird little shrimp in it and were off tasting. Also you can get better tacos al pastor elsewhere.\n\nYour best bet here is going for simple dishes; I noticed someone used Roberto's as a comparison, someone also mentioned the tacos have one, not two tortillas. If you are looking for an authentic, inexpensive Mexican restaurant, this is the place.",4

review_153124,restaurant,"I have to say, I'm pretty surprised that this place isn't rated a little better. I thoroughly expected it to be a 4 - 5 star place with a ton of reviews. (of course, it is in a fairly sleepy shopping center)\n\nWhile my experience here has been limited to scattered mornings in which i'm playing hooky from work, I really wish it was closer to home and I could be more of a regular. Their drip coffee is good, and the iced americano i got this morning was great. I can't speak to the rest of their drinks. \n\nFood-wise, I've only ever had the quiche and the occasional cookie... both amazing. I would try a breakfast sandwich, but honestly, I never get past the quiche. It's just always so good. They always have a good selection of flavors (cherry tomatoes and basil, red peppers & feta, spinach, etc.) and they're always delish. The one thing i will say is I wish their menu was a little better explained. Maybe they have printed take-out menus that I haven't seen that offer more explanation, but there's a fair number of \""named\"" sandwiches that give you absolutely no clue as to what's on them. And for a guy that's both a) adverse to asking questions, and b) wants to avoid being the guy that holds up the entire line.... this is a hurdle. (also, while everyone I've dealt with is perfectly nice,  for some reason I do always get the feeling that everyone in there is part of one big in-the-know \""clique\"" and i'm the visiting outsider. Maybe they just get a super high number of regulars?)\n\nAll in all, i'm still perfectly content to jump off the 101 a few stops early every now and again, enjoy a great cup of coffee and a fantastic breakfast, and get a nice start to the day.",3
review_129480,restaurant,"I'll start on a positive note:  Valentino is a nice place.  Nice food, nice d\u00e9cor, nice waiters.   We had the tasting menu which included five courses, and each course had three separate dishes on the plate, so there was tons of food and tons of variety.  The food overall was interesting and good, though there was so much wine my recollection of the later courses is a little muddled and we had to get the dessert to go because we were so full. The problems I had with this restaurant had to do with the transaction.  I'm not saying everyone is going to have the same experience here, but I'm just expressing the events that happened to me which colored my whole experience at Valentino and left a bad taste in my mouth.\n\nFirst, I made the reservation on Opentable and it was a 1000 point reservation.  This means that the diner basically gets $10 back from Opentable and the restaurant has to pay $7.50 per person to the website.  So a few minutes before the reservation time, I got an email saying my reservation had been cancelled.  When I inquired with the hostess about this, she brushed it off, said they still had the reservation on their books, and denied any knowledge of why this could have happened.  Afterwards I contacted Opentable to see that I got the 1000 points applied to my account, and they said at the restaurant's request, I had to fax in a copy of my receipt.  I did fax the receipt to Opentable and received the 1000 points.  I can't say for sure that Valentino cancelled my reservation so that they wouldn't have to pay for the 1000 points, but that is what I suspect.\n \nSecond, the whole reason for dining there was because of the 20% off coupon that we had received when checking in at the Venetian.  After the aforementioned copious wine, I forgot to hand them the coupon, then went back 15 minutes later to ask them to adjust my bill.  They said no, that there was no way they could do this.  Just an absolute no.  Maybe Vegas establishments don't feel the need to treat their customers well because everyone is a tourist so they don't have to worry whether you're going to come back or not, but I didn't appreciate their unwillingness to even make any effort to help me out with this, especially since we had just spend $500+ with them.",0
review_556553,restaurant,"My brother and I originally tried Inka Grill back in February 2014. We LOVED their food. We lived in Bolivia when we were younger, so were excited to find a restaurant with a lot of similar cuisine to Bolivia. The owner greeted and served us and was so gracious to talk with us for a long time.\n\nMy brother had the Lomo Saltado and I had the Milanesa de Pollo (always my favorite). Both dishes were flavored amazingly. They came with salad (with the best dressing). Loved the sauces (the green is my favorite). It was great to have a Pisco Sour too. Since then, we have returned with different friends and family and the food is always excellent and reasonably priced.\n\nMy only feedback would be to brighten up the deco. Occasionally the service has been a little slow (was not the owner serving us).",3

Large and airy with light spilling into the room to match the bright attitudes of the service team I was seated almost immediately on arriving at a table in back per my request and after perusing the menu decided to do what I often do with a menu so tempting; over order.  Coffee in hand and copious refills to follow my meal started off with a pair of pastries including a tender sticky bun and an unfortunately slightly dry scone that livened up slightly with a touch of butter and jam and moving right along my main plates would arrive shortly thereafter, each proving larger than anticipated.  From the smoky chicken atop a crisp yet pliable waffle and onward to the dense egg-bread topped with fresh berries and bathed in fruit-tinged syrup it would be hard to decide which dish I preferred as both were good but neither were 'best of genre' but unable to resist the signature carrot cake (not gifted to me as many have claimed on their first visit) I must say that this dish truly is special - one of those rare situations where reinterpreting a classic shines a whole new light on the dish and puts something pedestrian on a pedestal, the dense spice cake rife with pineapple and coconut served in three layers separated by light cream and flecked with white chocolate.",2
review_532207,restaurant,"My husband and I came here with a friend because the other restaurant we wanted to dine at for lunch was closed. We were seated right away and our drinks arrived rather quickly. It took a while for me to decide what I wanted to eat, since I had my heart set on that other restaurant, but our waitress was very understanding and patient. Finally, I decided on the smoked chicken Waldorf salad - apples, walnuts, and chevre cheese. My salad was really good - I especially liked the apple honey dressing. It brought the entire salad together. My husband ordered the beer battered fish and chips and our friend ordered the bacon cheese burger.  The fish and chips were good, the fish was flakey and I liked the batter they used. The chips (fries) were good as well. Our friend enjoyed his burger, no complaints there. Overall, it was a good meal in which we got to catch up with our friend. It wasn't anything above average, but not bad. If we were in the area, we might go again.",2

review_582436,restaurant,"Go to Waffles INCaffeinated and get your grub on. I did.\n\nWhat I ordered was a caprese and crab omlet a cappuccino and a side of bacon and an orange juice.  The restaurant was empty when I arrived there at 10:30am so I had my pick of where to sit.  The color scheme appealed to me. I took a liking to everything from the black bamboo textured walls to  the earthy green paint color and black wood tables and chairs through out. There was a vibrant and healthy palm tree in the rare of the restaurant that  was adorable.  The green color  Waffles INCaffeniated picked for the restaurant is literally my favorite color it's like they painted the place just for me.  I would absolutely adore having this color scheme in my home.\n\nMy one and only complaint was that my bacon was not drained of grease and did not taste anything of apple wood smoked bacon. I felt I was being a little greedy when I ordered the side of bacon. I should have said no.

review_341061,restaurant,"I feel like I need to write an update since somehow I am the only reviewer and I last reviewed in November 2008.  This is hands down the best sushi place in Vegas.  I grew up eating Gulf Coast sushi in Houston and always thought that was the freshest, the best...but seriously, Chef Jin gets fresh fish daily, and gets his hands on anything exotic.\n\nLast night he treated me to madai, Japanese snapper, a fresh fish he sliced off the filet during dinner.  He is always creating new things.  I just go and never order - he makes whatever (knows what I like and what I don't), and he and his wife (the outstanding waitress and hostess Yura) are so kind.  I get matcha iced tea without asking.  I have a favorite seat.  They put on sports on the flatscreen when I come in.\n\nHonestly, I worried when he added all-you-can-eat because the quality is too good.  You can get any roll, any appetizer (including hamachi kama), any salad, any nigiri, handrolls, ikura, uni, sweet shrimp, tempura, mochi, you name it - for $25.95.  I only do all you can eat on a rare occasion because I usually just eat nigiri and maybe a handroll or interesting creation.  Rolls are too filling for me.\n\nIn summary, the food is great, the service outstanding, the atmosphere quaint and casual, the prices reasonable, the green iced tea yummy, hot sake ready, and for the special occasion, I get the chocolate souffle for dessert.  I couldn't live without this neighborhood joint!  Just see my zillion pics for food inspiration.",4

review_649584,restaurant,"We were in the mood for some BBQ so we thought what better time to try the newly opened Billy's BBQ. I had high hopes for this place seeing that there had been several raves. We ordered the 3 meat combo with 2 sides. The pulled pork was ok, the brisket I was dissatisfied with. Maybe I was just expecting too much. All the flavors were there but the quality of the meat was inferior. They asked me if I wanted fatty or lean brisket and since I couldn't decide, the lady helping me suggested one of each. In less than 10 minutes our food was ready to go. I had a minor issue with the place seeming aloof, they didn't seem very friendly in welcoming customers and I found it offensive they would say bye to some patrons and not to some and in hindsight we were not even offered the \""free\"" soft serve they have. But that's just me. So fast forward the drive home. I was disappointed when I saw the brisket, one piece was supposedly lean but it was still very fatty and the fatty piece was almost inedible. I thought it'd be just a little fat on top which with the right amount of char will add a flavor burst but it was big chunks and unpalatable. On the brighter side, all 3 sides we tried (mac and cheese, baked beans and honey cornbread) were on point in taste and texture.",2

review_9499,restaurant,"It's a TGIF, so you'd think that it would keep up with standards.  The service was nice, but on a Wednesday night (and it was actually fairly busy at the bar), you would have thought that they'd be a little more attentive. \n\nThose on the other side of the bar that the bartender had their backs to were serviced less unless you happened to be friends with the bartenders.   At least so it seemed.  Didn't bother me as much since I was just having dinner and as long as my Coke was refilled, I was good.\n\nI had a Jack Daniels Flatiron steak (medium rare).   They might have to teach their cooks how to cook a steak.   When you cut into it, there were two different \""red colors\"" which basically means that the darker red is \""raw\"" while the other red was \""cooked\"".   Not a good sign if you can't cook steaks at the right temperature.   And with meat, it's always better to be more conservative with the timing.\n\nEverything else was fine, but being that it's a chain, I expected at least average ratings which the food part didn't induce.",1
review_476900,restaurant,"Originally from Chicago, I crave the Chicago Vienna dogs at times. \n\nWe went across town in search of the Chicago Dog for me, and the Italian Beef for hubby. We were greeted as we walked in the door by two very friendly and outgoing people behind the counter. The Italian Beef was ordered 'wet' (whole sandwich dipped, bread and all) and with the spicy jardiniere. \n\nWe took a seat and waited while everything was made fresh. I loved all of the posters and pictures on the wall showing the Chicago stadiums and teams. Made me feel like I was back in Chicago for a bit. Hubby loved the Italian Beef, and made a great mess of himself while eating it. If the juice is running down your arms, you are eating it properly!\n\nThis was definitely a fun place to visit, with super friendly staff and great food. I give it 4.5 stars since it seems a bit pricy. Not too badly though. I was torn between 4 and 5 stars.",3
review_485915,restaurant,"This place looked very promising from the menu and the decor.  I typically enjoy any Fox restaurant, however, this restaurant is a gimmick.  \n\nI ordered the free range half chicken.  I really enjoy this dish at most restaurants, but I was disappointed.  The chicken seemed to be low quality, and was very fatty.  The iced tea was good though.\n\nIf you are vegan or have a food allergy, this restaurant will be great for you.  However, otherwise, you are paying for food that may have a gluten-free, vegetarian, or vegan label that lacks flavor.  If you are looking for this option, then try it, but otherwise, I would find a restaurant that offers a smaller selection of these dishes at a lower price.    \n\nJust mediocre.  And way overpriced.",1
review_488716,restaurant,"Charlotte wake up and get your face on this food! Halcyon is amazing. The service is great, the resturant is beautiful, but more importantly the food is passionate and inspired. Everything I had was great. I started with a gin drink called the seer. Light refreshing and a good kick. Then I got the squash blossoms as an app. Light almost a tempura style batter stuffed with cheese and seved on a nice tomato chutney or salsa. The waiter asked to take my plate but I shut him down. I used the home made bread to sop up all the flavors from the bottom of the bowl. Next I ordered a nice clean but not too fruity hefeweisen from Vancouver bc. I love wheat beer and this is right up there with the best. For my first course I ordered the lyonnaise salad. This was a bit unsuspected in that I didn't read the menu all the way through. I expected some form of lettuce. But once I took a bite of the light vinaigrette fris\u00e9e with the egg and chunk of bacon it was the perfect bite. Lastly for my entree I ordered the lamb three ways. The chop was amazing, cooked perfectly and well seasoned. I actually asked for salt but did not need it;-) now the star of the show was this perfectly cooked and seasoned sausage. Juicy and oozing with flavor. When my wife saw my face while taking my first bite she asked me if I was having an orgasm... I did. I keep thinking about how amazing this was I am going to make sausage this week just to see if I can get close to what I had. The only disappointment was the lamb belly. Had amazing flavor but it just does not melt in your mouth like pork belly. Parts of it I had to spit out. Not because it tasted bad but because it was just not breaking down in my mouth. If it was lamb 2 ways it would have been flawless! I am looking forward to going back to try the rabbit the chef said it was his best seller unfortunately I was too chicken to order it. But after this meal I am sure it will be amazing. Thanks chef soft bringing this to Charlotte.",4

The service is not very good right now. Two times now we were seated and waited 15 minutes before someone even came over to greet us. Throughout the meal its the same thing. You have to flag servers down or they wont check in on you for additional orders. Too bad, used to be a go to place. Hopefully they get it together.",1

review_411872,restaurant,"When we saw this so close to our hotel we got very excited and couldn't wait to try it.  We were hoping for a memorable meal and some yummy tequila.  The place was mobbed when we arrived for lunch but we were able to sit at a high top inside right away.  We asked the waitress for some recommendations on which tequila to try first and (of course) she suggested the Cabo Wabo.  OK, we both got margeritas. \n\nI inquired about gluten free and she brought me a gluten free menu which, to my surprise, was rather small considering a lot of mexican food is gluten free.  I ended up ordering the Shrimp Fajitas.  FAJITAS....as in comes with soft corn tortillas?  NOPE.  My meal came and no tortillas.  I asked and the waitress told that they had gluten in them.  Uh, ok.....shouldn't the menu state they DON'T come with them?  I mean, fajitas are fajitas.  \n\nNext order of business was to get some silverware so we could actually eat our meals.  We asked and then waited, and waited and waited.  I finally got up and took silverware off an empty table.  Hubby asked for some hot sauce, which was never delivered either.  Service sucked, flat out.  Our waitress acted as if we were an annoyance to her.  The food was mediocre at best and EXTREMELY overpriced.  I'm sorry Sammy.....I really had high hopes for this place but we will not be back.",1

Very diverse and unique offerings and taste that felt very carribean which is what we wanted.  Only complaint is for my entree i was really looking forward to the Paella and it came without the Chorizo which should of been included, chef had to make it for my dish after the fact and it was brought out 15 minutes into the entree.  With the Chorizo i felt the dish was a bit to spicy but overall a good dish.  We will be back and I will try another entree. Great drinks as well.",3
review_31497,restaurant,"Very Bland, Poor Tasting Pizza! \nDoes NOT live up to the Hype!!!! \n\n\nThis was the first and probably last visit to Nellos. This pizza does not live up to all the hype here on Yelp. I ordered a pizza with black olives and beef. I had the \""original\"" crust. The crust was thick, chewy and tasteless. It looked as thought it was put on a conveyer oven, not woodfired. After the second slice the crust became too hard, bland and chewy to even eat, like cardboard. It was a very bad product. The sauce was very bland, and it looked very much like a frozen pizza, except some frozen pizzas are better. I really don't understand the pizza market in Phoenix.\n I grew up in on authentic Italian pizza and cuisine, albeit here in Phoenix everyone seems to sing high praises to very bad pizzas. This pizza does not even compare to a good Pizza. I just think that the folks here in Phoenix haven't tasted a real pizza, If they travel back East and try the pizza then they would know what real Pizza Pie is supposed to taste like.  For now if I want a good Pizza Pie, I'll just have to make it my self.\n\nI would not recommend this place to anyone.\n\nOne Star for the Food, One Star for the Service (Service was good, Pizza Bad)",1
review_649434,restaurant,So excited to have such a great restaurant closer to home!  Our first visit tonight and I my family is still raving about it. We had chicken parm and even though they didn't have my son's favorite dish on the menu they made it for him anyway. All of it was amazing. We finished up with tiramisu and it was also delicious. Portions are generous and they have a great wine selection. The service was also impeccable. We will definitely tell our friends and we will be back for sure!,4
review_583724,restaurant,"seeing that this place gets 3 stars it's just about right...hopefully the new winner of hells kitchen rights the ship..first the sliders are amazing, everything else we tried was not gordon Ramsey quality...also the waiters need some more training. the real problem is zeus the manager. my waiter honestly made a mistake which happens i understand but it took over an hour to get my lamb chops and when i got them they were over cooked and the plating was awful. when i asked for the manager, this guy zeus comes. i explain to him what has happened, since for a hour no one came to my table, he just took my plate and came back with the bill and DID NOT apologize or anything. the reason this place gets 2 stars is because the sliders were awesome. hospitality management really needs to be replaced. i  expect the same service and food on a Monday that i would get on a Thursday. i watch all his shows and i know for damn sure he would not allow this. Gordon i Hope you read.this review and get rid of zeus. After waiting over a hour for my main course and not getting the right meal all i need is a simple apology which i didn't get. i got treated like my money was worthless here. this was also the 2nd time i went here since the first night on our trip we had a great time. i look forward to hearing back from you guys",1
review_28517,restaurant,"Let me start by saying apparently I have no friends in Phoenix...... No one told me of this gem until last weekend. I have been out here for 12 years! \n\nI am not a big fan of Mexican food, unless it is done right. Yeah I've slummed it at the Taco Bell and took a step up to the Del Taco & of course I have been to Macayo's. I have to say I am in love with Carolina's! \n\nI had the Machaca burrito with potato or should I say Pappas! To say I am a fan is an understatement. The tortilla's are the best I've ever had delicious! The machaca (shredded beef with chile's, tomatoes, onions & spices) was perfection. Not to spicy and lots of meat they don't hold back. It's so tender and juicy the best machaca I've ever had. \n\nOK so confession time I had one on Saturday and was back for another today and bought a half dozen tortilla's! Yum! \n\nThey are closed on Sunday and this location closes early through the week. In regards to the Ghetto reviews, it may not be your side of town but if you think this is the ghetto you obviously have never been to the ghetto. \n\nBoth times I have been here no one has bothered me or approached me. Which is more than I can say for other parts of town. Damn near every car in the lot and across the street were under 5 years old and high end. BMW, Mercedes, Navigators and so on. No one is worried about having their expensive cars there. \n\nAbout the decor, this is not a zagat sit down matradee type restaurant. This is a dive, a joint, a place to get great Mexican food on the fly. Yeah the spot needs paint, soap, water and decor. But I would rather not pay for that and get my cheap delicious Machaca burrito. I have eaten there and taken it to-go. I will be back!\n\nAlso the people were not rude to me they were busy as hell and very nice. I think some of the reviewers might want to come down from their ivory towers and enjoy some good food. Plain and simple. \n\nCarolina's is delish, I will be back and hope to see my fellow yelpers there!",4
review_366346,restaurant,"Best fast food burger out there. \n\nDouble-double animal style. Crunchiest lettuce one has ever crunched, ripe tomato, 2 x juicy beef patty cooked in mustard, 2 x american cheese, thousand island, and grilled onions. This beast was to die for. Really though, heart attack is imminent but so worth every morsel. Each burger patty is made to order. Also, according to their website they do not own a freezer, microwave, or heat lamp. And their burger patties have no filler or preservatives of any kind. Pretty cool. And in this case, a little goes a long way. You can taste the quality difference in their product compared to any other fast food restaurant.\n\n1 is enough to fill you up. Trust me. I ate two and needed a prescription for stretchy pants and no motion what-so-ever for several hours after consumption. Eating 2 does NOT come recommended.",4
review_413818,restaurant,"I expected more from one of the premium station casino locations.  Especially since they had a special Tuesday night $19.99 buffet instead of the usual $13.99.\n\nI did like the multiple chef stations which included the usual carving station, a noodle station, and a pasta station.  Also, the salad bar had quite a few items including baby corn so I was happy with my salad.\n\nOn to the food.  Definitely disappointing.  The knishes were inedible, the potato pancakes nothing like a true latke and were severely undercooked. I hate the taste of raw potato.  The corned beef was actually pretty good although dried out a bit from the warming lamps.  The matzoh ball soup was dishwater with a grainy but fluffy matzoh ball.  The rest of the food was mediocre and even the fruit seemed a little less than fresh.  The selections are limited and some things seem out of place such as the sushi and shrimp being at the salad bar.\n\nFor desert, the chef was helpful in cutting fresh pieces for customers and the few items sampled were good.  They don't have a large variety of ice cream flavors but the vanilla ice cream tasted good, similar to bryers.\n\nThis place is not worth a return trip.",1
review_330855,restaurant,"It was the first time I had Portuguese food so have nothing to compare it to, but the chicken was delicious.

review_245161,restaurant,"I will never understand the overabundance of \""mom and pop\"" pizza shops in Peoria. \n\nIt almost seems like a practical joke.\n\nDozens of \""local\"" pizza shops, all with different names and menu layouts, all living on the same street, peddling the same food made with the same ingredients to the same curious customers, who keep shifting from one pizzeria to the next hoping to find something \""different\"" before they ultimately settle on whichever one is more atmospherically pleasing to them. \n\nThis is not to say Ballpark Pizza isn't worth a try. \n\nIn fact, of all the copycat pizza parlors in the city, it's one of the better ones.\n\nWhile their pizza isn't worth writing home about, it's pretty low on the grease factor and tastes quite nice when dipped in ranch. It's pretty inexpensive, too. A large with two sodas and some wings shouldn't run you more than 20-25. \n\nThe wings are what Ballpark's known for. They make a certain sauce that is so intensely hot that they have a wall of fame for anyone who can eat half a dozen of them within a certain time limit. One of my friends has his picture posted on the wall. I keep asking them for a \""Hall of Famer\"" discount whenever we show up. We never get it.\n\nOh, and the rules stipulate that while consuming the wings, you may drink whatever you think will help stave off the burn. I've seen guys pounding shots of ranch to keep the burn at bay. \n\nJust a sense of what to expect at Ballpark.\n\nIt's sports-themed, but to the extent of other \""sports restaurants\"" that blast six or seven TVs all playing different games or whatever the hell ESPN has on. The TVs just loud enough so that you can watch it and carry on a conversation. I was at Ballpark when Michael Vick was first investigated for that whole dogfighting thing. Then, a couple of months later, I was at Pullano's, which is literally down the street, when he gave his public apology.\n\nI need to find something new to eat.\n\nPersonally I prefer Ballpark as a lunch spot. It's fairly uncrowded, even during the lunch rush. The food comes to  you fairly quickly, and the staff are always walking about the dining room looking to hook you up with extra napkins or whatever else you may need.\n\nIt's the little things that make a pizza shop.",2
review_542577,restaurant,We went to the new location last night to celebrate my daughter's 16th Birthday.  We were met with very rude service from the hostess.  We were a party of 5 and were advised that we couldn't be seated until a majority of our party was there.  My daughter and I waited and when our 3rd person showed up we asked to be seated since a majority of our party was there.  The hostess told us that she needed at least one more person to arrive.  I explained that we were waiting for my elderly parents who are 81 and 89 to arrive and that they had gotten lost and would be there any moment.  We wanted to sit and order drinks while we waited.  It was a Monday night and the restaurant was less than half full.  She ignored my request.  My partner followed her and insisted that we be seated.  She finally agreed to seat us but gave us a an eye roll and dirty look.  Had it not been my daughter's birthday I would have left.  Our waiter was friendly and the food was good but not award winning good.  I like the atmosphere but honestly had a bad feeling after our encounter with the hostess.  I do not think I will return.  There are many great restaurants in Central Phoenix that are welcoming and friendly to return to one that doesn't care about their customers.,0

review_206294,restaurant,"Second time eating here in the span of 10 years and NOTHING has changed. Food once again is CRAP and service is terrible. Paid $22 for an Ahi tuna salad. Ahi looked bad. The color is one of that which fish should never be, a nice greyish tinge rather than bright red/purple. Served on a beautiful bed of shredded iceberg lettuce. What? Too cheap to buy mixed greens Bellagio? 7 very small pieces of Ahi was served on this \""salad\"" so my friend and I each got a whopping 3.5. \n\nWe also split the lobster mac & cheese which was served with a spinach salad that was simple, but decent with spinach, heirloom tomatoes, and a pesto dressing on the side. The lobster mac & cheese was certainly missing the main protein. It should have been called thick bacon/ham mac & cheese. There was hardly any lobster. We had to ask our server for our bread basket after our entrees came out 40 minutes later. A quick lunch ended up taking almost 2 hours. Even when the place emptied out, our server was still slow. \n\nThis place is understaffed and the food is garbage. Definitely a tourist trap since it is located in the gardens & nobody will care about this review when they are starving and don't know where else to go on the strip, as this is a decently priced option, but please don't blow your money here.",0
review_233067,restaurant,"The place outside is just plan but  when u go in it's ok. You need to ring the door bell and someone says hey in a tiny little window and you enter from another wall. \n\nPlace is super dark, they have tiny flashlights on the menu. The bread they give you is hard with no flavor.\n\nOrdered Caesar salad (Taste like raw garlic and butter or oil didn't like it) and Italian dressing salad (salad seems old not bright green or crisp to it).  \n\nOrdered the clam paste with white wine. The clams was soo over cooked it seem like I was chewing gum there. The paste was cover cooked. The sauce has a tiny bit of spicy which I didn't like. I didn't even finish 1/2 my plate. Took it to go. Hoping someone would eat it at home. nope ending up in the trash. Waste of $23.95  \n\nAlso ordered the Sausage Spaghetti plus extra $5.00 for a huge meatball. The paste was over cooked again, the meatball was soft, the sauce didn't taste good had a sweet but nasty bitter flavor, and the sausage was just ok nothing special. Chef Boyardee Ravioli is soo much better. Could have bought a few dozen cans.\n\nI would not go back there. I wouldn't even go there to begin with but my roommate gave me a gift card. So I went.

review_18413,restaurant,"The restaurant features a menu as eclectic as its directionless, yet somehow a bit charming, decor (picture a British phone booth facing a red-brickwalled hallway and Japanese elements mixed in throughout); it's a blend of Italian and Asian pasta dishes, from which I've only ventured through the Asian portion of the menu.  \n\nThe Asian noodles here can be outstanding and the selection is one of the best in central Phoenix, but there's not much more reason to come here.  My favorite is the beef udon suki, with chewy, thick noodles and lots of beef and flavor. The ramen dishes are passable, although not the best in the Valley (noodles are a little too thin and a bit overcooked, broth is a bit lacking in flavor, although still robust and meaty enough to be pleasant).  Skip the tantan-men, which is billed as a spicy soup and tastes like little more than that:  spice in soup.  As for rice dishes, the katsu is decent, but avoid most of the appetizers:  shrimp shumai were mushy and flavorless, the Korean spicy rib lacked the spice, richness, and tenderness you'd want from a dish with that title, and the gyoza are less than noteworthy.\n\nThe lunch special is another great reason to come here:  for under $10, you can get a filling combination, like your choice of noodle soup with inari or a California roll.  Although the sushi isn't a reason to visit Cherryblossom and the California roll isn't something I'd jump at ordering even at my favorite sushi joint, it's a great deal.  And when you're really there for the noodles anyway, how can you beat that?",2
review_529910,restaurant,"Le Thai, more like Le awesome.\n\nGreat location, great food, and an awesome staff. The portions here are perfect and the flavor will explode your thai tasting brain. \n\nAfter a brief moment of waiting outside my friend and I were brought in and sat at the bar. First thing I noticed, you can see right into the kitchen; the smells coming from it were intoxicating, which turned-up my hunger level to eleven. The decor of the restaurant is a mix of back alley dining with a few standard Thai musings on the wall. I love the vibe of this place... busting, loud and very unassuming. \n\nThe food here is filling and great to have with a group of friends while sipping drinks and telling drunken stories. If you're feeling super chatty and a bit buzzed, might I recommend what I ate, the Ga Pow! \n\nGa Pow is a heavy plate of ground pork (or chicken) with a spicy sauce, chopped veggies, and a big fat fried egg on top. This also comes with a side of white rice, but I opted for brown. This plate of food is more than enough for one eater and could definitely be shared if needed. The meat and veggies were cooked perfect, the pork was still firm and the veggies stayed crisp even though they were swimming in this delightful spicy sauce that I could not get enough of... I mean, hand me straw so I can finish slurping up this savory sensation! The bartender gave me an awesome tip which was to add lemon juice and the dry seasoning at the bar to my meal. I had to fight back the urge to bury my face this bowl. \n\nMy friend and I started with a soup before our main courses showed up, but sadly I can't remember the name! I know it was first on the soup list and we had fried tofu added to it. This was delicious, an amazing flavorful broth with a few hard boiled eggs in it and multiple levels of zesty flavor... this mystery will kill me!\n\nA few notes... \n- When the weather is cooperating, I recommend sitting outside in their back patio area. Clean, spacious, and you really can't beat Vegas weather when it's in the low 80's. \n- If you find yourself waiting outside for a while, just belly up to the window. Yup, there's a little drive-thru window you can walk right up to and order a beer or cocktail and sip with your friends while you wait. Great f**king idea! \n\nPRO-TIP: Check-in and get a squeezable surprise.",3
review_360140,restaurant,"YUM! Everything we ordered was really good! The Crispy Shrimp and okra, with hot and cold sauces, very good! \nThe Mac and Cheese was okay, I wouldn't get the lobstah next time if I ordered the dish, actually not sure I would order it again.\n\nThe Fired Chicken with citrus brine...I am still thinking about it 2 weeks later...so YUM!

Did try one of the spicy ramen bowls - really liked the broth - the noodles, hmmm, can you say, TOP RAMEN\n\nsadly, had to knock it down one star because the salmon sashimi my daughter ordered was partially frozen !   Admittedly, i tried to convince her to avoid the sushi since my sense was this is not a place to go for the sushi.\n\nshould also knock it down a slight notch because the bacon wrapped asparagus was a disappointment ( raku is on a totally different level with this dish )  \n\nIt feels like a larger version of  Ichiza - larger place and larger menu.  \n\nIt's worth a 2nd visit to try some of the other items.",2

Restaurant seems unsure of its identify! We ordered wings and they were mediocre. The nachos were also nothing to write home about. Server didnt know what the specials were for the night and seemed annoyed that we asked her to find out for us. We were excited for a new bar/restaurant to open, but after giving the place a try twice now we will stick to going to other restaurants in the area.",0
review_150850,restaurant,"This is the best deep dish pizza in Champaign! Service is fair, but the food makes up for it! It is usually crowded during prime dinner times and big weekends in Champaign, so make sure to plan ahead and call your pizzas in ahead of time. Their delivery is not very reliable, so I suggest carrying out if you are not up for dining in.",3
review_409125,restaurant,"I've been to The Liberty for lunch a few times and it's always be great.\nTonight for dinner however, the gnats were on the schedule apparently. There were a ridiculous amount of gnats around our table and our waitress had no condolences or explanation. Also, not sure our waitress was really too interested in waiting on us as she'd actually not had anything we asked about...how do wait tables at a place you've not tried the food. You don't eat fish? Then you shouldn't work somewhere they serve it. The food was better than expected, just don't expect your service to be of much.",1

review_566639,restaurant,"My dinner here tonight was really pleasant.  We ordered the hot appetizers plate, which gave us a nice sampling of several items, all of which where good. The lamb chops were terrific - juicy, grilled just right, and with great flavor; I love lamb and these were the best lamb chops I've had in years! I was also pleased by the items in the Cleopatra plate - properly grilled chicken, beef, kafta, and vegetable kebabs on a bed of fluffy basmati rice.  The dining area is very spacious, table settings were impeccable, and the service was very friendly and gracious. I am glad that we have this new restaurant in this northwest part of metro Phoenix.",3
review_302778,restaurant,"I like the food.  It's quick, they have good salad and half sandwich options.  When I am out running errands this is a nice go-to place to swing into to grab a quick bite to-go without having to eat heavy fried food.   Have I had better, yes.  Does it matter, not really.  I don't have to wait in a long line (hello Panera) and that makes me happy.",2

Eat at your own risk...waiters can be very mean.",2
review_578722,restaurant,"Super stoked to have made the reservation after reading all the great reviews, however my expectations were not exactly met.  \n\nDecor: lovvved it... hommie... warm... comfy\n\nService was really slow at the beginning.  The busboy was very good about bringing us water and bread, however we waited for about fifteen minutes and there was still no server, so I had to ask the busboy for one.  All the servers in the restaurant seemed super rushed, yet none were rushing to help our table.\n\nFinally when a server did come, he too seemed rushed, and mentioned that he was just helping out the actual server for the section.  I don't think our actual server came until the end.  Either way, all the servers were pretty scarce for most of the meal.\n\nThe beer list wasn't anything too special, so I settled on the cocktail: Salty Sun of a Gun.  Nice interesting bourbon based cocktail, however I normally like a stronger fuller taste.  More potent, maybe?\n\nCharcuterie Pizza was spicier than I imagined.  Interesting taste though, as was the New England Fry.  Not your typical calamari dish.  There was a definite kick.  Oh, and the lemon aioli uhhhmayyzinggg...  I was taking the bread, and even my pizza crust and drenching it in the aioli.  \n\nBut the dessert, that's what took the cake - literally.  We ordered the Triple Layer Cake thinking it would be too sweet, but it was soo subtle.  In the finest sense.  All the flavors mixed together go so well together.  \n\nFinal thought: Very Unexpected.",2
review_137403,restaurant,"Being 20 years old and never being to the Rainforest Cafe apparently was unacceptable to my boyfriend. So we ate there a few nights ago. Looks-wise it was everything I had imagined...Moving animals, thunderstorms every 10 mins, little water drip drops behind our table and a lot of noise. I'd give it appearance 5 stars but the service and food falls short.\nOur server was not exactly attentive and fun loving. He seemed so rushed and irritable. He could have been new or swamped so I'm not totally bagging on him for it, but it still rubbed my first RC experience the wrong way. The only thing I thoroughly enjoyed was the Mocha Java shake. YUMMY! I sucked it all down within minutes.\nI ordered a burger and fries and was not impressed. THEN AGAIN, I work at LBS Burger Joint and The Barrymore, and in my mind no one beats our burgers . My boyfriend had a chicken sandwich, he said it was okay but very messy. The fries are whatever. Not super yummy but not gross. \nAll together a burger, a sandwich and a shake cost me $44.00. It's pretty looking, but there is no way Im going back....",1
review_516869,restaurant,"Let me say I am still in partial food comma so please excuse any misspellings.\n\nWalked in when they opened and was greeted by Dale one of the owners.  He starts to explain the menu to me and then asks what I would like to sample.  Well that was all he needed to say.  I tried everything pretty much on the menu from a sample perspective.\n\nLet me get this out of the way.  Texas House BBQ is going to upset the BBQ scene here in Phoenix because it is super simple and super good.  I love that they don't sauce any of their meats at all.  It truly lets you savor the flavor of all the meats.  \n\nSpeaking of meats there are plenty.  Brisket (3 different cuts), spare ribs (with the tip on, I almost cried), chicken, turkey, pork loin (very tender and juicy), sausage (I usually don't like sausage but theirs is awesome), and chopped beef.  \n\nI got a pound of the moist brisket, half a pound turkey, half pound ribs, and chopped beef.  For sides I took home the pinto beans (super good and not sweet thank God), and also the creamed corn (more on this later).  Let me tell you that this meal I just had was a great experience.  The flavor of the meat combined with my onions and jalepenos will not be forgotten soon.  The ribs are bite through tender, and my moist brisket had a great rub on the bark and was also tender.  The oak they use is very mild on the meat but adds enough to let you know that it is BBQ.  Did I mention the brisket was super good.  The turkey was really tender and moist as well with a very different rub than the rest of the meats.  The chopped beef is mixed with BBQ sauce and this was really not my thing but my wife loved it.\n\nThe creamed corn gets its own paragraph since it is probably the best BBQ side I have ever had.  I don't like sweet things but this one blew my socks off and goes great with the savory BBQ meats.  It has a great consistency and the corn is not canned but fresh.  You really get a good corn crunch from the creamed corn that lets you know it is fresh.\n\nMake sure you get plenty of the pickles, onions, and jalepenos when you get take out.  I almost ran out half way through my plate.\n\nIf you couldn't tell this place is awesome and will be disrupting the BBQ scene in the valley.  It is also on 24th street and Roser which is not to far from Laveen, and adds to the new restaurant renaissance here in south Phoenix that includes The House at The Secret Garden, and Ammano Pizzeria.\n\nThanks Dale and team.  I will be back soon.",4
review_561987,restaurant,I got a burger asked for medium. I got we'll done with over salted fries. My girlfriend got a salad. Which looked like cut up condiments for the burgers on top of romaine lettuce. The lettuce was mainly the heart of the romaine which was yellow.  Cool looking place that's about it. After visiting here I really don't want to attempt to visit aiellos. Don't want to get disappointed.,0

review_643510,restaurant,"Awesome food, terrible service!\n\nCame here to celebrate my birthday with my family, so there was a group of 8, which they couldn't handle. We had to ask our waitress 3 or 4 times for things and they don't seem to be educated on food allergies. She kept getting gluten free mixed up with Vegan and thought Vegan was Vegetarian. I know people with special food requests like that can be rather annoying but c'mon, if you're in the food industry, you should educate yourself so you don't make people sick. \n\nI have to say that the food and atmosphere is pretty great. This place is like Asia meets Mexico, which creates some really unique flavors. They have various types of guacamole, which are out of this world. Everything is  small plate so it's perfect for sharing. I definitely recommend the pomegranate guacamole. \n\nThe one downside is that the food arrives as it's ready so that resulted in everyone getting their food at different times. Pretty much everyone was done eating by the time I received my friend rice. This concept is good for drinks and appetizers maybe, but not for entrees. The kitchen seemed to get backed up at times resulting in long waits. We waiting over 20 minutes just for a dessert to come...and it wasn't even right. Perhaps the managers/owners should take a closer look.\n\nThis place is good for smaller groups it seems.",2
review_89607,restaurant,"Have always enjoyed the food and thought it to be of very good quality. \n\nThe service is lacking due to the focus on hiring the nearby students from the university. On one occasion we made reservations, and while being seated the hostess tried to place us at a table. We prefer a booth and asked to be seated at one but she refused saying that they were not yet seating in that area. We insisted, and this went back and forth several times before we said that we will leave. She finally allowed us to sit at a booth but then made a dramatic show about placing us there before stomping off. \n\nIt was bizarre and not the typical experience, but just a cautionary sign of what comes when staffing students.",3
review_287896,restaurant,"I love Earl's! I stayed at Planet Hollywood on my recent Vegas trip, so Earl of Sandwich was my typical lunch (because I never woke up early enough for their breakfast menu that's served until 11 AM.. boo!)\n\nI tried the BLT, The Earl's Club (Turkey and Bacon), Italian and The Full Montagu (Roast Beef and Turkey). Amazingly, all of the sandwiches were seriously good. I'm not sure which was my favorite, as they all were equally tasty... but since I'm a bacon lover, it'd probably have to be the Earl's Club. \n\nHighly recommend all of their sandwiches and will continue going here on my future trips to Vegas for a quick bite. \n\nSkip their tempting cupcakes and cookies at checkout though. Waste your calories on the million other Vegas pastry shops. Shamefully, I tried the sugar cookie, chocolate chip cookie, brownies and the red velvet cupcake. All extremely generic tasting. The frosting on the cupcakes were super sweet like canned frosting and the cookies are made with margarine instead of butter, which is never a good thing for chocolate chip cookies. Or any cookies for that matter. ;)",4

review_440119,restaurant,"Okay Sammy... We need to talk about your place. The food was okay and the service, well the service was below par to be kind. Let me explain. \nWe walked in around noon and could count all of the people in the restaurant on one hand and since the weather was awesome today \""mid 70's and a slight breeze\"" we opted to sit outside and enjoy our lunch and the weather alike. The server sat us and was kind enough to let us know that if we decided to order pizza's it would be a little longer then normal because they just opened and the oven was not up to temp yet. That is totally understandable and i appreciate the warning. So we sat outside and decided on our order, closed the menus, finished our waters, and continued to sit. So about 15 minutes later the waiter came out and asked if we had decided, since we had plenty of time of coarse we said yes. We ordered a prosciutto asparagus pizza a kids BBQ Chicken pizza and I ordered a Grilled chicken breast and hummus sandwich. after another 15 to 20 minute wait we received our food. The sandwich I ordered was amazing and so were the other items we ordered but the lack of service and the constant empty drinks unfortunately were to much to overlook. The three stars are for the food being good and obviously the 2 docked stars are for the service, or lack there of. \nIf you have the hankering for sammys i would recommend the W. Sahara Store over this one.",2
review_579160,restaurant,"I hardly ever take the time to write out a review, but this experience could not go ignored. I would  have much rather spent my hard earned money elsewhere. \n\nThe glass that separates you and the ordering counter must make it hard for them to hear, I had to repeat myself constantly. It would've been helpful to have been told that from the get go instead of figuring it out at the end. \n\nI asked for a sample of the chicken because I've never been and was having a hard time ordering, the guy looked at me like I was stupid for asking. I pointed at little plastic containers they had by the meat and said that they must obviously give samples. He finally let me try a bit.  It was a big ordeal to find out how long of a wait it was for the green chile pork to come out. I had to ask him like 4  different times if he would just make one with the little bit that was left. He acted annoyed for having to scoop out the meat that was left because it required a bit more effort. \n\nThe lady at the checkout was rude when I asked if I could pay while I waited for it to finish cooking.  She ignored us until I asked for drink cups. All in all, the food was ok (the tortilla soup was a massive disappointment, they don't even put tortilla in it. Don't order it if you are a fan of tortilla soup, the flavor was off), the service sucks and the line is a cluster f***k. At least chipotle has an efficient and friendly assembly line. I will not be returning. Much better places to support in the area.",1
review_374437,restaurant,"Drove past this place like a thousand time, finally decided to drop in and order something. Was very surprise how great the food was, if your into larb dishes make sure you order the larb moo(grill pork slice flavor with spices) it is sooo yummy! And also don't forget to order gai yang(marinated grill chicken) it is pact with flavor and very tender. Thats about the only 2 things i order frequently but pretty much everything is good. The only downside is the wait time, make sure you order for pickup and avoid lunch hours if you like to dine in, cause they get extremely BZ. Overall great food, easy parking and very nice staff.",3
review_239041,restaurant,"I've been to BJ's probably over 10 times, and I've always been consistently impressed by their food. I've had so many pizzas, pastas, tacos, and desserts from their that I've lost count, but I will showcase some of their highlights. \n\nI usually don't get appetizers from BJ's because their food is in really large portions, so I'm full by those alone, but I've gotten their chicken tenders before, and they're really good. They're nice and crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside like you'd expect. They also give you this tangy honey mustard dipping sauce with them which is a great complement. They also come with a mountain of french fries. The fries don't taste too good with the honey mustard, so I usually just ask for ranch dressing for them... because I think ranch is the perfect dipping sauce for fries, not gross ketchup.\n\nTheir pizza is great. If there is a long wait, and you have to sit in the waiting area, the servers will come out with deep dish pizzas put up into individual bite sized pizzas for the crowd to sample while waiting. I think this is epicly nice of them because I would be perfectly willing to wait, but it's always nice to snack on a little slice of pizza too. hehe. \n\nI usually just stick with pepperoni pizza. It's a classic and is loaded with lots of meaty pepperoni, stringy cheese, and hearty tomato sauce. Normally, I hate tomato sauce on pizza, seriously, the less sauce the better, but with BJ's pizza, their sauce is so flavorful that the abundance of it is fine with me! Their barbecue chicken pizza is really solid as well. I've had it a couple of times. I like CPK's BBQ chicken pizza better, but this is a nice deep dish take on it. Next time I go, I need to try the buffalo chicken pizza to see how that compares to various ones that I've had. Maybe I can persuade my boyfriend to go there this weekend. hmm...\n\nThe sandwiches are really yummy. Their pulled pork is really tender and not dry at all. The Cobb sandwich is tasty too with the addition of bacon, cause everything tastes better with a littler... err... a lot of bacon on it. The BJ's burger is great, but you should definitely add bacon to this one for the reason that I mentioned above. Their parmesan crusted chicken is delicious. It's very cheesy, and their mashed potatoes are very creamy. Their fish tacos are great too. They go great with a side of strawberry lemonade to drink.\n\nSo... as if this review wasn't long enough... DESSERT! First off, get a pizookie. I've seen some of my friends' pictures on facebook where they've gone to BJ's and they've ordered something like the apple crisp for dessert. I've shaken my head at those pictures many times. Seriously, you don't know what you're missing unless you get the pizookie! It's the best part of the meal. I always get Triple Chocolate Pizookie with Ghirardelli chocolate. My boyfriend and I split it, and it's pure decadence even after you claim that you're so full that you can't eat dessert. \n\nSo yeah... this was a really long review, but I've been here so many times, and I really wanted to share how much I love BJ's. I will definitely be back soon.",4
review_198613,restaurant,"So I read the reviews of this place first but curiosity got the best of me.  I figured that since the last two reviews were positive  that maybe efforts were made to turn things around but I guessed wrong. \n\nSo after reading the outside menu, I decided on the lemon cod. The bartender was my server and wasn't really rude but kinda \""Pittsburgh salty\"" which would be fine at some of the lower class bars in the area but not a place that charges 16 bucks a plate for fish. The portions were small, the presentation was laughably amateurish,  and the food wasn't horrible but I could have got much better fish for the same price at Pipers Pub. The decor is nice and the place seems clean but that seems to be about the only high points. I would not eat here again. If you want first rate food on the south side check out Pipers Pub, Local, Cheesecake Factory, or The Smiling Moose and leave PSC to their delusions of being \""upscale\"".",0
review_167430,restaurant,"Next time I'll make sure I make reservations for the outdoor seating since its directly adjacent to the bellagio watershow, but the inside of the restaurant was nice as well. Make a note that you must have somewhat formal attire or else they won't seat you. \n\nThey weren't too pricey for the amount of food you get, you can definitely order one entree for two and an appetizer and that would fill you up, they also give you warm fresh baguette as well. \n\nI had the sole fish with frittes and veggies and it was amazing... melts in your mouth and puts a smile on your face for sure! French onion soup was pretty good, it's a pretty big bowl so don't underestimate the portions they give you. I think every entree ordered at the table including the salmon salad was delicious. For a table of 4 entrees and 1 appetizer, the bill came out to be $90, not too bad for a nice restaurant in vegas.",3

review_540000,restaurant,"I've finally decided to review this great little restaurant since I've been here 5 or more times.  I was first dragged here several months ago by my father who lives close to there, for lunch.  This place is owned by the same people who own Wally's, and he is a Wally's fan while I am not, and so I wasn't thrilled about the prospect.  I was glad to be proven wrong.  I have to admit, I have had only one thing on the menu: the seasonal vegetable chop salad.  It's seriously one of my favorite things in life and I eat A LOT OF SALADS.  There are so many different ingredients that somehow don't compete with eachother but rather delicately blend together and yet all stand out as delicious little pops of flavor in every bite.  I have seen dining partners order various things from the menu and have never seen anyone disappointed.  Sweet Pea loved the hamburger, and he's a real hamburger aficionado, often proclaiming them \""too charbroil-y\"" or other made up adjectives that I don't quite understand.  The jalapeno cheddar grits that he got as a side were out of this world- just enough of both the pepper and the cheese flavors without being overwhelming.  I think my exact comment on them was \""I'd like to dive headfirst into a vat of these and eat my way out.\""  The service is always top notch.  Go, you won't be disappointed.",4
review_484600,restaurant,"Wurstle is an interesting concept with a lot of room to grow, but a few kinks to work out.  Basically, this is a hot dog stand that has a their own unique bread and sauces.   There are many different kinds of sausage (cheddar and spicy are two I remember), along with either a plain baguette, or a wheat one.  They kind of hollow out the inside of the baguette, and put in the sauces and additions (including mustard, ketchup, onions, sauerkraut), and then put the sausage in the hole.  \n\nThe product is good, but there are a few things odd about it.  First of all, any toppings you put in will invariably fall to the bottom of the baguette, instead of being evenly distributed.  Also, it seems like the sausage is too thin compared to the bread, that sometimes the flavor of it can get lost amongst in the flavor of the bread.  Finally, it's absolutely atrocious when it's cold (I know because when they were giving out samples, it was on a tray that was kind of cold that cooled off the pieces very quickly.  Note the owners:  The point of samples is to have a good presentation and a delicious product to entice people to try your product!  If the sample's bad, people think the product's bad, when it really isn't!)\n\nAnyway, not too bad, but not the best, either.  I'll give them another shot this week, it's worth a shot.",2
review_568253,restaurant,"After a night of partying, we wanted pho and decided to give Pho Bosa a try.

We liked the egg rolls and appreciate the plethora of items provided to stuff in the lettuce wrap, including noodles! We thought the nem nuong rolls, while not bad, were better at Brodard in the OC.\n\nService was a little slow.

She was very attentive and made sure we were taken care of.\n\nWe had the BBQ chicken and the Liempo (BBQ pork belly) and both were excellent.  Our dishes took a few minutes as they don't cook the meal until you order it, but it was worth the wait.  We added an order of lumpai shanghai (at three pieces for $1, who can turn that down?) and the lumpai was also very good and very fresh.   We had the Cassava cake for dessert and it was a great ending to a delicious meal.\n\nThey are now offering longsilog and tosilog for breakfast too.\n\nPrices are reasonable and portions are big.

review_516120,restaurant,"From the outside, the restaurant seems a little misplaced, but once you walk in, the environment is so inviting and feels like a place to have a good time. \n\nGot some blue moons for $3 each, which is a pretty good price if you ask me. I came with 8 other people so we ordered a whole lot of shrimps and crawfishes. Got 2 lbs of the hotnjuicy special crawfish and 2 lbs of garlic butter shrimp, 2 lbs of lemon pepper shrimp, 1 lb of louisiana style shrimp, 2 orders of sweet potato fries, 1 order of cajun fries, and some rice. The bibs and gloves they provide are very handy, and you should change your gloves once or twice during your eating period because the sauces definitely leak through and you'll be stuck smelling like cajun for a few hours or days after. The crawfish were a bit of a struggle for me to break into, but the sauce did it for me, so good and with a kick (my lips were for sure burning way after finishing eating). We started taking shots of balls of rice with the different sauces on top, DELISH! The shrimps had a significant amount more meat than the crawfish an were easier to peel. The cajun fries order got lost somewhere during the meal, but they were pretty nice about getting the order to us as fast as possible. \n\nThis place is definitely worth trying and won't break the bank!",3

review_369460,restaurant,"(My 50th review.  God, I'm a fat pig.)\n\nTraveled well across Vegas to get to this little spot.  I had the small sampler, so I could try a little bit of everything.  The pulled pork and brisket were on the tough side; the pork was very dry and the brisket was fatty.  The ribs were okay (not fall-off-the-bone) and definitely had the best tasting BBQ sauce on it (did I fail to mention that every meat has its own sauce?).  In lieu of the hot link, I ordered the pulled chicken (which they graciously allowed to substitute) which was by far the most unique tasting.  Not bad, not great.  It came with seasoned steak fries (always a favorite) and a choice of two breads--I chose the cornbread and Texas toast (which was made hot and fresh).  I gotta give it points though for the portions and the price and the friendliness of the employees (apparently under new management).  Also, note that there are only 3 tables in the dining area, so I'm guessing it doesn't get very crowded (or, plan for take out).",2

review_384758,restaurant,"I ordered through GrubHub and I paid dearly for the privilege. I had a Thai iced tea, the duck larb salad, and 3 salad rolls. The Thai iced tea did not disappoint me, it was sweet and tasty. However, the food was not really what I expected.\n\nThe salad rolls were mediocre; at a Vietnamese restaurant I frequent, these are filled with lettuce, mint, cilantro, shrimp, pork, and have a delicious refreshing taste. However, when ordering these, the shrimp was optional ($2 extra) so I opted out. But what I received was basically just a mishmash of lettuce greens and shredded carrots. No peanut sauce was provided - not sure if this was by design, or an oversight of the delivery. Very overpriced at $5 for 3, based on their ingredients.\n\nThe duck larb was also weird. I have not had larb many times, but when I first had it many moons ago, it was delicious ground beef with ground rice along with some nice herbs and spices in a delicious dish. This duck larb was pieces of admittedly delicious duck, in a greasy, watery brown sauce, with some cilantro and random veggies like tomatoes. No ground rice was apparent and I would really hesitate to call the end result larb at all. Also, I ordered it \""medium\"" and it had no discernible spiciness that I could tell.\n\nDelivery was fast and efficient, but with my quibbles about the price and quality of the food, well, I might go back for one last-ditch try, but with all the bad reviews here on Yelp already, I am extremely reluctant to try anything else, and I will likely skip this in favor of more tasty delivery menus in my area.",1

review_497357,restaurant,"Overpriced. Unrefined. Disappointment. To me \""Herb Box\"" would invoke fresh, clean, seasonal flavors. This reminded me more of that other restaurant with the name \""Box\"" in it.\n\nIt seems like it has a lot of potential but they need to drop their prices and drop the deep fryer. It's a lot of fluff without much substance.\n\nStarted with the Asparagus and Fennel Frites - aka, beer battered and greasy hunks of vegetable served in a basket with fake newspaper.\n\nHusband had the trout. Said it was good, and the side was a cheesey asparagus casserole. Came with spinach, which again was fried.\n\nI had the Halibut special. Fish was amazing  with a little tapenade on top but the fingerling potatoes were essentially home fries. No veggies on this entree unless you count the olives. \n\nServer was friendly but I should have known to ask the price on the halibut before ordering it. Atmosphere was sophisticated, but the giant flat screen detracted from what could be a really elegant dining experience.",1
review_376638,restaurant,"Ruben and I came for dinner with two of our friends based on their recommendation. I have to admit that I was weary, as I usually am with sushi restaurants. I also already have my sushi spots and until something goes wrong, I have no plans on straying. \n\nThe nigiri and hand rolls were good and I liked the Tiger Roll (Shrimp tempura, cucumber with spicy tuna, avocado, and eel sauce) and Dancing Eel Roll (Shrimp tempura, cucumber with spicy tuna, unagi, and eel sauce). I also enjoyed the Ahi Poke (white onions and seaweed salad) and shrimp and vegetable tempuras. Otherwise, nothing special or memorable. \n\nI'm a little surprised how much everyone likes this place. It wasn't terrible, but I was not impressed in any way. I think the lines between AYCE sushi restaurants start to blur a little because offerings are the same or very similar, so after trying a few restaurants, something needs to stand out. Perhaps if I had tried Kaya first, I may have liked them better.",2
review_66474,restaurant,"I dont know what happened to this place!! I have been coming here since 2007 and let me tell you, 4 years ago this place was easily a 5 star!!! I went back a few weeks ago to have lunch after almost 2 years and i'll say that the customer service really went downhill. The waitress was so nonchalant and indifferent towards us it aggravated the hell out of me!! Back in the day, they served cuban bread  to your table before your meal was ever served! I asked the waitress twice for an order of Cuban bread! The first time she said the chef in the back was preparing it.. 15 minutes came by and after our main course was already on the table, still no cuban bread. We were finally done eating and ready to go when the cuban bread finally came to the table!! We had to have it boxed to go.. I will give 3 stars because the food is really good, but they seriously need to get it together or they're gonna loose this loyal customer...",2

review_131345,restaurant,"Seriously, I'm not sure how anyone could give this restaurant anything higher then 2 stars. If they did, they should get out more often. Here's the thing, if this place was in a little town in the middle of nowhere, I'd say okay but it's just off the strip in Vegas. The culinary capital of the world people. There are at least 100 superb restaurants within a mile radius, so WHY would you ever go here??? lol but people do and my guess is, they're tourists and they don't know any better. I can pretty much guarantee if you are a local you would never ever choose to go here! \nThe place was packed! We had to wait over an hour, which didn't bother me because there was plenty of seating. The atmosphere is kinda cool but there are plenty of restaurants with that type of atmosphere/decor. The service was not very good. My friends raviolis came out ice cold. I had the chicken parmigiana, it was okay, kinda bland - nothing special. The \""free wine\"" (I use the term free very loosely since I paid $28 for a piece of chicken - I'm sure the price of that nasty free wine was compensated for with the overpriced piece of chicken) was disgusting....the red smelled and tasted like red wine vinegar and the white wine was warm - yes white wine warm!? There was spinach that accompanied my chicken that as soon as I took a bite I wanted to spit out....but of course didn't. It was the most disgusting thing I've ever tasted. I sat and tried to figure out this distinct (overwhelming) flavor in the spinach and when the server came over I asked her if anise was in the spinach. She looked at me in surprise and said you're the only person that has ever guessed what's in that. She said people either love it or they tell her to get it off their plate. I'm guessing the former group is a small group, so I'm wondering why they serve it? Oh gawd it was gross. Black licorice flavored mushy over cooked spinach.....not my idea of good food. Sorry but if you're planning on going, I'd say go across the street to McDonald's and save yourself some money......seriously! \nBTW - there were a group of Italian speaking guys behind us that got their food as we were leaving......gawd I wish I could have seen their face when they bit into that \""Italian\"" food!!",0
review_502523,restaurant,"Pretty disappointed...simply, Meh! It was close to my new work so gave it a try. Lack of taste overall. I'd say their ingredients are pretty fresh but the execution of combining the sauces and the ingredients needs serious work. We tried combo appetizers, pad thai and pad see ew...pretty common thai dishes. A word of advice, esp. for a guy with normal appetite...don't go there hungry! Or make sure you don't order their lunch special. The portion is really small and you'll most likely leave there hungry. Even with $12 combo app + pad see ew lunch, I'm so unsatisfied! Quantitatively and qualitatively speaking! And don't think I'm a huge Samoan or something... I'm not a big guy any means, 5'9\"" 150 lbs. The service was prompt and friendly tho. I'm just glad I can find better Thai restaurants near where I live. And with better price too!",1

Too many other great restaurants in the area.",1

review_511307,restaurant,"Hubby chose this place for Father's Day breakfast and it was an EPIC fail.  We were seated and our pleasant waitress handed us our double-sided menus to look over.  When she finally returned 10 minutes later, we all had picked out our choices for breakfast BUT were told that they were ONLY serving brunch for $25.00pp or 2 other entrees.  Now why would the waitress not tell us this when giving us our DOUBLE-SIDED menus to look over?  Why wasn't this posted at the front door?  I will tell you that as other customers arrived, they were equally surprised to hear this after they were seated.\n\nAll 6 of us sucked it up and ordered the brunch.  For $25, they offered omelets, prime rib, 2 different types of potatoes, mac & cheese, cold french toast, salad, veggies, fruit & dessert.  I was at least excited that there was an omelet bar ~ that was until my made to order omelet came back to me undercooked and runny (UGH), my son's had ham in it when he clearly stated NO ham.  Hubby's came with a beautiful thick ring of oil/butter surrounding the omelet on his plate.  Seriously, my 16 year old can cook a better omelet.\n\nThe carved prime rib was decent but as we walked the 2 table long buffet, we were greeted with chafing dishes that had the cheapie aluminum pans in them. . .the type that you can buy at the grocery store.  It screamed \""we pre made all of this yesterday\"".  I get that you have to pre make many of these items for a buffet (that most customers didn't anticipate. . .tasteless mac & cheese and mediocre potatoes done 2 ways) but come on ~ put them in a decent chafing dish so it looks appetizing and not like you're eating at the family reunion picnic.\n\nWanting to get our money's worth, we went to the tiny round desert table where there were tiny-sized assortment of deserts that were dry and tasteless.  Betty's Nosh should stop purchasing these from the bakery they got them from.\n\nThe staff was nice but pretty clueless and constantly apologetic blaming management and the kitchen for the mass confusion of the menu and the messed up food.  No one wants to hear blaming and excuses. . .just put out a great food and great service.\n\nI know that our party of 6 had the choice to get up and leave, however, made a 9:00 a.m. reservation a week earlier because we had another place to be at 11:30 so finding a place to eat on FD with a short wait would've been difficult at best.  None of us would have minded had the staff had their act together AND if the food was decent.  I felt like we got the royal screw job for the amount of money we dropped on a brunch that we didn't know about.",0

review_492151,restaurant,"Wicked Spoon is different. \n\nWe visited buffets at Cosmopolitan, Bellagio, Wynn and M resort, and found cosmopolitan's wicked spoon to be the most special and enjoyable. The other three buffets are all decent with lots of food selection, but they seem to be quite similar to each other. In Wicked spoon, most dishes are decorated and prepared individually into perfect sized portions, like how food is served in expensive non-buffet restaurants. Food taste is also excellent, must try.",4
review_415736,restaurant,"When in Vegas, you'd never find me at Hooters Hotel & Casino but we happen to swing by because my gf had a $200 voucher for free slot play. As her 10 minutes of free slot play came and went we were incredibly hungry. Mad Onion was pretty empty but we decided to check it out anyways.\n\nYour typical Vegas casino diner just not nearly as good. Granted the menu theme was cute with their \""mad\"" names such as the Irritated Italian Sausage and Peppers but the food was a disappointing. Their menu ranges from a $20 dollar steak to a $10 blt all the way to a $35 surt and turf. I opted to get the mad onion burger. A mean 1/2lb patty and despite the burger being juicy it lacked flavor. The fries were limp and cold. Nothing about this place would ever bring me back. \n\nGood day Mad Onion. I won't be seeing you ever again.",1

They handled the large group well, although we had pre-ordered the food so it wasn't too difficult, apart from the people who forgot what they ordered (there's always one).\n\nReally nice place, of course great position above the Mound. Cosy wooden interior and then good view outside. Great for warming up after being outside in the cold. However the food wasn't great - our venison was rather chewy and some people barely touched it. The soup starter was fine but no butter came with the bread.\n\nThe price was to be expected for the location, although the beer was very expensive and one might have expected a little more from the food for that price.",1

It's served in a cheese tortilla bowl, with ice burg lettuce, some crumbled bacon, diced tomato and eggs and your choice of salad dressing.   I got the vinaigrette.\n\nThe salad was a decent size, however, the \""cheese bowl\"" it was served in was a little stale, and the vinaigrette was too strong.  Service was good, I love the large glass they use for their beverages, no refill was needed it was so big.",3
review_565895,restaurant,"I was so, so excited to give this place a try. Mexican food, guacamole, margaritas?? It's my perfect little restaurant trifecta. Sadly, my husband and I were in and out in an hour and we probably will not be back any time soon. \n\nWe were seated at a comfortable table near the bar and offered popcorn. What? Where are my chips and salsa? Oh, we have to order them? Hmmm... I was slightly suspicious. I politely declined the popcorn and perused the drink list. The list looked good! My husband and I both wanted to try something different - I got the blueberry mojito and he ordered a fresh mango margarita with salt. Forever and ever later, our drinks arrived. Mine was fine. Just fine. His drink tasted like they had mashed up some frozen mango and it had thawed in his drink. It also did not come rimmed with anything. Small detail, but still... \n\nWe ordered the guacamole trio as an appetizer. Whoa. A ton of guacamole. We probably should have asked another couple to sit with us and help us eat it. The guacamole concept, three different guacs, all a little bit different, is a great idea. Unfortunately, it tasted like pre-made guacamole that each had a little bit of something mixed in at the last minute. Totally disappointed. The chips were ok but also nothing amazing. \n\nOur meals were fine. Nothing exciting. My husband ordered three different tacos - he said the pork one was excellent, the other two were pretty blah. I also ordered a fish taco and it was ok. Nothing stellar. \n\nAll in all, our entire experience took less than an hour. Our server was super nice, the bar was neat and clean and cool. But, unfortunately, the drinks, the apps, and the meal were all totally ho-hum. Such a bummer! I will try to get back in and give it another try but I certainly won't be rushing to do so.",1
review_234563,restaurant,"Amazing Mexican food! If it were on the strip, this place would be packed. Got the $6 guacamole which sounds crazy, but it is made FRESH at your table side and tastes soooo amazing. It is worth the $6 because it is a large portion so you can put it on any entree you order. \nI got the chile relleno and it was wonderful. \nThe main event was the salmon asado! It had an amazing pur\u00e9e sauce of deliciousness. \nMUST GO! Why aren't you already here?!",4
review_368359,restaurant,I generally despise pub food.  You have to be drunk and hungry to want to eat pub food.\n\nBut Worlds End's food is actually quite good as far as pubs go!

Yumtastic. \n\nTheir handmade tortillas are mad fresh n fluffy, which makes their gorditas and sopes killaaahh. Try a chorizo gordita...RIGHTNOW. \n\nThe service is also friendly, though it can be a bit slow at times. Also be warned that you pay extra for a second helping of chips and salsa, though it's less than $2. \n\nGo here for dinner, and follow it up with a cocktail at Le Tigre Lounge.

review_206414,restaurant,"We were looking for a Chinese Restaurant that serves Dim Sum late.  We stumbled across this restaurant in the Gold Coast Casino around 1:30 am.  At first we didn't know if they were closing.  No one acknowledged us for a good five (felt like 10) minutes, and nobody else was waiting.  There was no staff in sight to welcome us or take our name.  Right before walking away, someone finally confronts us.  Because we were hungry and lazy, we ended up waiting another 5 minutes since the place was packed.  \n\nOnce we sat down, service was tolerable.  Our drink refills came frequently, and the food was prepared quickly.  We got our Dim Sum fix with Shu Mai and Hargow...pretty average.  Everything else (Fu Chow Fried Rice, Black Pepper Beef, Kung Pau Chicken, and Walnut Prawns) exceeded the standard except for the Hot & Sour Soup.\n  \nBad start...but good finish..",2
review_643191,restaurant,"Went here for lunch. We got there at 11:30 and were quickly seated, however, it is a small space and filled up while we were there. They sat us at the communal table, I was fine with it and had some interesting conversations. However, I could see how if someone was shy or didn't enjoy talking to strangers how they might not enjoy sitting there. The decor was industrial modern. \n\nWe split the chicken skins with smoked honey - which was awesome! The skins were crispy and the honey gave it the perfect sweet to contrast the salt. Also, it was one of the more reasonable items on the menu at $6. \n\nWellington Empanadas - they were good but I wouldn't order them again. They were really salty, and to me part of the beauty of the wellington is how well they are cooked -while the phyllo dough likened itself to a wellington the filling was chopped beef and other vegetbales. Thus at $10 not my favorite item. \n\nThe short rib sliders with spicy tator tots - three sliders for $14. A little over priced. The sliders had a sweet flavor to them and a crunch from french fried onion the bun. There was not much sauce on them either. My friend likened them to a marshmallow flavor of a rice krispy treat, while I don't completely agree with her I found it amusing. Again, good but not phenomenal and I think I would try something else. \n\nDuch Confit Flatbread - very good, again sweet like the flatbread was brushed with honey - however, very very small portion. Possibly six inches in length by four inches or so across. Also, the flatbread was not crisp on the bottom, however the flavor was good. $10. \n\nGlad I tried it, loved the chicken skins, but a little pricey for what you receive for my taste but it is a Kerry Simon restaurant. If you go for lunch go early - they fill up fast with the downtown work crowd. If there are only two of you expect to be seated at the communal area.",3

review_172947,restaurant,"I love gambling, partying and obviously I love to eat so naturally Las Vegas is one of my favorite places to visit. I have been to Las Vegas a few times and Pink Taco has always been one of my favorite and more afforadable places to dine. Unfortunately, on my last visit, I was a bit disappointed. I don't know it if was my selection or if they have just simple fell off, but the joy I typically have eating there just was not there. The portion size was good, the prices average and the service was what you typically expect, but the food itself was just not that good. I ordered the Carne Asada Tacos and it lacked something (aka flavor). I had to added so much hot sauce to make it taste an ounce of what it should & steak naturally has a bit a flavor so I am not quite sure why that was. And although they use fresh corn tortillas, it still could not save the taste of these tacos. On the other hand, the chips and salsa were pretty good, but I hardly expect that free chips and salsa can make up for mediocre food you actually pay for.",1

review_391148,restaurant,"I knew that going to Bar Masa during restaurant week would be my one shot to eat there (though the $49 early menu is there all the time, just found that out!)\n\nMy friend Susan D. and I made reservations for Saturday night at 7 PM.  Sporting my brand new crazily blingy sparkly new shoes, I trounced through Aria with anticipation.  We were escorted by our beaus, who trotted off to the Aria buffet while we went in search of opulence.\n\nWe were seated in this stunning restaurant, with lights hanging from the ceiling and red accents everywhere.  Our server was Chase.  I started off with a Jalapeno Ja cocktail (house made jalepeno vodka with lime and muddled cucumber, garnish: 2 slices of Persian cucumber on a toothpick) and Susan opted for the Kyoto Cheers (soju, lychee, pomengranate).\n\nOur 3 course meal: we both started off with tuna-yellowtail ceviche (normally $28 on the menu!), then each got the 10 piece sushi sampler at Chase's recommendation (over $70 if ordered a la carte), and then for dessert Susan ordered the miso creme brulee and I ordered the yuzu sorbet.\n\nThe ceviche: cubed maguro and hamachi, grated daikon, fresh snipped chives, tiny diced raw jalepeno with a yuzu-esque sauce.  Scrumptious!\n\nOur chef's choice sushi: 2 pieces of chu-toro, 2 pieces hamachi belly, 2 pieces of tai, 2 pieces nama sake, and 2 pieces amaebi (no heads).  Someone had a heavy hand with wasabi on the fish (okay to Susan, a bit too much for me).  The toro was a surprise for this type of menu.  Tai was too tough.  Amaebi was something special.  A very nice chef's choice for sure.\n\nWe ordered a few things off the menu before getting to dessert (so yes, this did not end up as just $50 per person!) - Susan ordered the peking duck and foie gras fried rice - I tried it and it was very tasty.  I got one piece saba (smoky, unusual flavor), one piece anago (sea eel, hard to find but nothing exciting), and uni (small but very fresh and flavorful - POW in my mouth!).\n\nThen, Susan peer pressured me into another cocktail!  Still thinking of my gal Jaime W. and our spicy drink pursuits, I went for spicy drink #2 with Bacardi O, yuzu juice, fresh mint and floating shichimi togarashi pepper flakes.  \n\nFinally we made it to dessert.  Her miso creme brulee was very tasty, but my yuzu sorbet (which actually was more like a granita) was outstanding, bright citrus-y with a sprinkle of mint.  Overall, great food and service - big plus to the generous offerings for restaurant week and getting about 55% off the price of what we had.  Now that I spent on myself what it would cost 4 people at Blue Fin, it is back to my joint after this!",3
review_245211,restaurant,"I've been going to Mimi's since I discovered them in '06 and my visits have now become very few and far between. \nLong time customers could probably agree that the customer service in most places is like a casino game, you get lucky every once in a while but most of the time it's a shot in the dark. Also the prices have gone up while the quality and quantity goes down. And for someone like me who had a \""usual\"" it was very surprising to see the kinds of changes being made over the years. \n\nAlso...don't go past 7pm, you'll get left with the slim pickings.

Now the \""manager\"" is putting her hair up with gloves on.\n9. Now the next shift is arriving, I can only hope this crew is better!\n10. Wait, I was wrong! This employee has gloves on but putting her hair up and fixing her hairnet. Then logs in and now goes and does someone's food with the same gloves on.\n\nThe manager has no control over the employees, they run her and the restaurant.\nSometimes you wish you worked for the health department so you could write them up!",1
review_109500,restaurant,"If you don't go during happy hour its pretty overpriced. The bento box was a good deal though. California rolls, chicken teriyaki, rice, corn, and a salad for $7. Everything was okay. Definitely not the best sushi I have ever had, but not the worst either. In the long run, its close to my apartment so, if I do have a sushi craving, I'll probably be returning but I'll probably wait until happy hour.",2
review_300613,restaurant,"Yep, still tasty. I came here for an early brunch the other day, sat outside in the sunshine and had some delicious salmon and eggs over a potato cake sort of thing. Definitely a good pick. I really like this menu because they have many, many items that are ideal for various definitions of \""clean eating\"". Lots of locally raised meats and interesting combinations of veggies, and an emphasis on veggies as sides rather than bread and starch. I like also that they have a lot of small plates in case you're not as hungry, or just indecisive. The service is great, the coffee is excellent.",4
review_293745,restaurant,"This place is so messed up.  I've been maybe 10 times now, and it is so hit and miss. I keep coming back because I love the king crab legs and the lobster tail; haven't found another place that has them along with a decent array of other food in a lively atmosphere, but they don't inspire me with confidence considering I always spend over $100. My partners always end up with poor meals. \n\nFirst of all, their seating management is a disaster. On Friday's visit, I first called for a reservation - 9:30pm was the earliest offer.  I drove there anyway, arrived at 7:30pm, put in our name for a table for two, outside (new system in place - no more numbers, but vibrating alert gizmos).  I asked for outside, but she said 'let us know that when you are called' - probably the problem right there. We were told '20-30 minutes'.  No problem, we went to the smaller bar next to the outdoor dining patio and had a beer.  The Patio was 30% full only, and the waiters servicing the outdoor patio were standing around idle. After watching the patio remain largely empty for at least 20 minutes, I approached the front desk and asked, 'how come we aren't being seated since the patio is not full?\"" She immediately grabbed a couple of menus and seated us.  We later asked our waiter what was going on, he said ...'million dollar business with a couple of high-school kids running the front desk'.  Just about sums it up! \n\nWe also got dripped on and generally over-chilled by the misters and fans. We finally asked for them to be turned off, but it took a good 20 mins for the misters to completely 'dry out' (one of the reasons I want to sit outside is to avoid the over-chilled interior). \n\nI had the lobster tail, it was great. My partner had the 'hudson bay combo' ... the bacon-wrapped shrimp were great, but the lobster tail and the scallop were totally lukewarm, tasting like they were cooked well in advance.  Not good for a $27 entree.",1
review_26254,restaurant,"Sigh. I would not call this Mexican food, more like American style Latin food.\n\nNow that we got that outta the way, the tacos were so-so. The set up is kinda like an assemby line. You tell them which meat and toppings you want and they prepare it right in front of you. I've had tacos prepared this way before and the meat is never hot. I got the taco basket which includes tortilla chips. The chips and lemonade were the best part of the meal.",2
review_154910,restaurant,"Emeril's was good, but I guess I expected more from an Emeril Lagasse restaurant.  First the positives: great service, and the bread and butter pudding with whiskey sauce is absolutely outrageously delicious.  The sweet barbeque'd salmon was perfectly cooked, but I'm not sure I am one for a sweet sauce on my salmon - that's my own personal preference, so I wouldn't knock the restaurant for it.  Quail appetizer was quite nice.  Negatives: pork chop was dry, savory pudding side dish served with the pork was good but just a bit too salty for my taste.  And \""agast!\"" the beignets were dry and hard...a cardinal sin for a New Orleans-style restaurant to mess up the beignets.  For shame!  All in all, the restaurant had a nice atmosphere, great service and pretty good food.  With so many great restaurants in Vegas, you may be better off going somewhere else for your dinner, but hitting Emeril's for the bread & butter pudding for dessert!",2
review_234967,restaurant,"The first thing to know is that this buffet is super cheap -- which is awesome. I've tried just about every hotel's buffet and sub-$15 blows my mind. Food is separated by types of cuisine and they actually have a seafood section with piles of shrimp. Quality is okay, you basically get what you pay for.\n\nThere's also endless gelato. Some foods I liked included the ribs, potatoes, roast chicken, shrimp, and pastas. \n\nThis is the kind of buffet you take someone who isn't a picky eater or someone who you don't like too much but eats a lot -- or both. Great place if you're forced to pick up the tab.",2

review_268764,restaurant,"Used to say Subway was my favorite sandwich place but Capriotti's has knocked Subway off its pedestal.  I put a lot of weight on the bread of a sandwich and their's is great.  Just the right amount of chewy.  Tried the Bobby once (very unique) and loved it but keep going back to a basic turkey or roast beef with lettuce, tomatoes, and vinegar and oil dressing with herbs.  Perfect.  I'm usually able to resist their gigantic brownies.  Aren't you proud of me?",4
review_94680,restaurant,"I really hate to do this.  This restaurant is fit for those that think Taco Bell is a great place for Mexican food.\n\nThe buffet was pathetic and contained maybe 12 items (no white rice).  My sampling of their offerings ranged from terrible to mediocre.  China Garden has, hands down, the worst eggroll I've eaten.\n\nGiven the atmosphere of the place it was plain to see China Garden had regulars.  One guy at the cashier even commented that he'd been coming since 1970.  I don't get it.  This is the worst restaurant I have ever dined at.\n\nThe staff and whom I presumed to be the owner/manager was nice and friendly but that cannot make up for the poor quality of selection and food.",0
review_64008,restaurant,"Ambiance is great. You don't find many old-school restaurants like that in Vegas anymore. It's very dark and romantic as you dine with the oldies playing in the background. \n\nHowever the food is extremely over-priced and very bland. For appetizers, we ordered the Toasted Ravioli with Marinara Sauce $10, which was really good. \n\nFor entree, they are best known for beef, so we order the Chateaubriand Bouquetiere for two with Hollandaise and B\u00e9arnaise Sauce ($55 per person) and we added on Whipped Potatoes $8 on the side. We have never tried Chateaubriand Bouquetiere before and it was boxed out on the menu, looked special and tempting, so we figured we'd give it a try.\n\nThe Chateaubriand Bouquetiere, which is a roasted beef tenderloin, was just ok. The sauces were very bland. For $55, it also came with some steams vegetables on the side (carrots, broccoli and asparagus), which were just plain steams with no seasoning at all. It was not even salted. \n\nOur total (for 2 people)  with 1 drink, 1 appetizer, Chateaubriand Bouquetiere for 2, and 1 side + tax & tip, came to $180.  I don't know if we just order the wrong item from the menu or they were just having an off-day?  But we went there on a Friday night, from 5-6:45 pm. We were the only table there. There was one couple that came in during our dinner, sat down, took a look at the menu, then left. Another coouple came in as we were leaving. But overall, the place was empty on a Friday night!",1

review_283237,restaurant,"Holy Salty Soup! I literally JUST went there over my lunch break and I can't even eat the chicken noodle soup because its so salty...it almost burns. I am HIGHLY disappointed that a deli cannot do yummy chicken noodle soup properly. Its like I poured 2 salt packets into my mouth. I got the 1/2 sandwich and soup combo and for $7.75 you would think the sandwich (the Symphony) would be a lot bigger than what I got. It's basically the size of a half of a ham and cheese I make at home. Although the sandwich was kinda tasty, for a half, it's still TINY and not worth it for $7.75 and a cup of a salt. I don't think I'll go back. I am disappointed.  There just isn't a good sandwich shop around here, I guess. Boo.",0
review_234484,restaurant,"730pm on a Tuesday. Of course it's slower than usual. So tell me why the servers were so slow at everything?! You wouldn't even see them for 10 mins straight! And to top it off...our waitress had selective hearing, she only heard things she wanted to hear. If you tried to ask her for something she walks off acting like she didn't hear it. I had to ask for refills 3 times for my table. So annoying. \n\nAnd their food didn't make the experience any better... It was so blahhhh. The setup was the worst. You have ppl crammed up in corners. There weren't bowls where there needed to be. You had to walk the other way just to find some. And plates are only in the middle. So you had to walk past your food, get plate, then walk back to the food you wanted. Need a spoon for your dessert? Then walk all the way to the salad side (other side of the restaurant) and grab a spoon. It's so stupid! Not the mention that the chefs can't keep up with the food. There were dishes and dishes empty...made the place look unappetizing. There were so many chefs and they could've easily kept up with their cooking. \n\nMan I could keep going about this place....",0

review_101449,restaurant,Two stars for a two point five star place.  When the kitchen is having trouble getting the right dish out/ ingredients on the right dish there are professional ways of handling it that don't make it to the diners.  Yeah that inspires a lot of confidence. \n\nAvocado egg rolls were great even though 2/3rd of the ingredients the sun-dried tomatoes  and onions were scarce or so finely chopped as to be a homeopathic dose.\n\nPad thai was underwhelming and not much of a difference between ready made stuff from the store.   Name annoyed me  as anything I'd expect to find in a restaurant named after an area would be some of the foods from that area! It's  American food in the worst sense  Big Island meat loaf?

Originally we weren't going to split and then once the food came and we realized how good both of our sandwiches were we split them half and half. Both of them were incredibly flavorful and delicious. Contemplating the warm chocolate brownie right now... Hmmmmm, I'll let you know.",4

Their neighbor was more than happy to accommodate us in only charge us $15 for a corkage fee. Don't get me wrong  I don't mind paying a little more for corkage fee at a nice restaurant, but really it's just a glorified buffet. The sad part is we probably would have dropped about $600 that night. Maybe we'll go to Texas de Brazil next time .",0

review_323709,restaurant,"Excellent food, friendly service, OUTRAGEOUS prices!!  I'm glad to see many, many other reviewers have noticed this.  Even so, I think it worth pointing out that the dishes aren't \""a bit pricey\"", they're ABSURD.  I ordered the herbed quinoa bowl on the Sunday brunch menu.  Fresh, tasty dish, but for $13 I did not get a salad bowl, not even a soup bowl - it was, at best, a custard bowl.  And no accompaniment of any kind.  Ten to 15 minutes, eating slowly, mind you, and I was done.  With a carafe of iced tea (they had not brewed any iced tea that day, so there was none available by the glass - WHAT?!), tax and tip (service is good, and the server doesn't set the menu prices, so she deserves a full tip), I blew $22 on a custard bowl with a few spoonfuls of quinoa, beans and avocado and iced tea.  That is BAD value for the money.  I understand that they serve a \""niche\"" audience, source locally, blah dee blah, and I \""get\"" the Food & Beverage industry, but I genuinely felt ripped off at those price levels.\n\nOthers have mentioned the high price of the desserts.  I have never bought one here for that very reason.  Another example on the \""sides\"" for the Sunday brunch menu: ONE GF biscuit with gravy for $7!!  Despite this being a vegan place, I'd expect a \""slider\"" of filet mignon inside the biscuit (hold the gravy, of course) at that price!\n\nI will not be back, and for me to not return to a place solely because of price point and perceived lack of value is extremely rare.  Too bad, because they have a good product - they just charge 3 to 4 times what it's worth..",1

review_295720,restaurant,"This place is right next door to my house.  We came here when they first opened up and fell in love with it ever since.  Every dining experience has been excellent - the service is always friendly and attentive and food perfectly cooked/prepared.   We did a few ala cartes but most of the time it's always AYCE, both lunch and dinner.  Heck if they had breakfast I would do that too.  \n\nMost sushi places have a few items that are exceptional and a few not so great, but everything here range from good to phenomenal.  \n\nLet me talk a bit about their sashimi items.  I love sashimis and this place has some of the best sashimis i've ever eaten.  Their Seared Albacore with crispy onion in ginger sauce is oh so heavenly.  The only  problem is their sashimis are not included with the AYCE menu and that's understandable because the sashimis are pricier.  Another one is the Yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno and ponzu sauce.  OMG this melts in your mouth and it should be called screaming orgasm for your mouth!  amazing stuff!  How about this \""Tuna sashimi with shaved daikon in a chef special sauce\""? Everytime i finish this plate I want to lick the sauce off the plate but there's always people around me.  \n\nNow for their rolls.  They make the typical rolls like Rainbow, Dragon, Spider, Dynamite and Catepillar taste amazing.  Flavor explosion with every bite.  They have a few rolls that are wrapped in thin soy paper sheet that are not as filling as the ones with rice.  Some days I do low carb and i would order a bunch of these.  Pink Lady and Oh My Heart are my favorites.  If you like scallop make sure you order the Volcano, baked scallop with yum yum sauce.  \n\nSide dishes and appetizers are very small when you order with AYCE and that's a good thing cuz you just want to taste the variety of stuff.  Finish off with some mochi's and you can die happy.",4

A friend and I were searching Yelp for some good Mexican food around the south Eastern area when we stumbled across this place, checked some reviews, peeped at some food pics and took the plunge! The chips to begin the meal at almost all restaurants can't hold a candle to these chips, they tasted so fresh like they had just fried up some corn tortilla's and delivered them to our table with some very good salsa. We ordered the fries with shredded beef and cheese as an appetizer. They were so good, fries were cooked perfect and had bunches of cheese and beef. My friend likes onions and I don't, so they actually made pico with no onions separately for me, that was way cool. We both ordered the three Carne Asada tacos combo, they come with pico, cilantro and limes, once again they hooked me up with onion less pico!! These taco's are a little slice of heaven, small but so full of flavor. Service was excellent, and staff was very friendly.",4
review_189305,restaurant,"This buffet is terrible and expensive. The food was bland the service was almost non-existent and we were seated at one of those long bench style set ups where you have no sense of privacy at your table. At forty dollars a person it is more expensive than other buffets but has nothing to show for the extra expense. There was plenty of other seating that was quieter but we were crammed in on top of each other. The only thing the buffet has got going for itself is the dessert selection (lots of choices and a crepe station).however, my wife thought the desserts tasted old like a refrigerator. I can't believe so many people on yelp have had good things to say about this buffet! Yelp usually steers me in the right direction but we got screwed this time. No way does this place deserve four stars. If you have functioning taste buds don't abuse them by going to the Buffet at Wynn.",0
review_53898,restaurant,"My husband and I have found our new favorite restaurant!  Everything, from the extensive wine list to the homemade (by owner Josephine Billelo) Tiramasu was outstanding.  We have company coming in the next month and cannot wait to share this amazing Italian restaurant!!!",4

review_280228,restaurant,"Well, it's been about six months since my last Update for this, my favorite Golden Corral here in the main part of the Valley.  Mike C. & I dropped in for Breakfast & Lunch, arriving at about 10:45 AM today, after sadly discovering that the new Hong Kong King Buffet across the street has already gone under.  Everything here was delicious, no there was no \""smell\"" to the place, as someone reported, except for maybe that of delicious food!  Along with that, the table service was just right, as was the air temperature, food temperature, cleanliness including the bathroom, & everything else about the place!  \n\nIt shouldn't have to be Fogo de Chao at these prices & YES, I still think it's 5 STARS for this type of restaurant!  They switch quite a bit of the food out between 11 & 11:15 AM, so arrive just before that for the most amazing feast.     :-))\n\nBreakfast Buffet:  $8.79/$8.19 Sr.",4
review_100670,restaurant,"The restaurant was very adorable and the food was quite good, but the service was absolutely aweful. The waitress said but 5 words to us the entire time we were there and what she did say, she said it like she did not care what so ever. In my opinion, good food does not make up for horrible customer service.",0
review_46294,restaurant,Was there just before the remodel and thought the food just okay. It was 7:00 pm and we were the only ones in the front dining area. The waiter was nice but not as attentive as we would have expected since there was no one else there. Not somewhere I would choose to go to again.,1
review_404640,restaurant,"I've been working nearby for almost 3 years, and for months would see a steady stream of coworkers heading over to grab a breakfast burrito.

Now that they've doubled the price, I doubt I'll be returning.",2
review_555428,restaurant,"Love the food! but on a visit over the weekend... Service was the worse... \n\nHappy to hear they take reservations now.. wish I had known that, but thinking that it was first come, first serve like it has been there in the past we got there early, around 6pm. There was no one waiting and there were plenty of tables. \n\nWe gave the hostess our name and she said it would be about a 20 to 25 minute wait. \nWithin 10 minutes we saw a table being set with the number of guests in our part, .we thought wow, this is great. \n\nAbout 10 minutes later, a couple came in who had a reservation for 7 people and were seated at the table that we thought was going to be for us. We understand.. but what I didn't understand was how we continued to wait while the couple waited for the rest of their party to arrive. One person came 10 minutes, later, another couple 15 minutes. I know this because we ended up waiting 45 minutes for our table. \nBy the time we were seated, their entire party was finally there. \n\nWorse part, a party of 10 that came in 20 minutes after us, were then seated next to us at the same time. \n\nMost restaurants will not seat unless the entire party is there. When they are, you can turn tables much quicker. Hopefully this will be a trait that Firefly picks up on soon.",1
review_54037,restaurant,"We went there on New Years Eve. My husband got fajitas, and I got quesadillas. My husband said his fajitas were very oniony, had a few spicy peppers, and very little anything else. My quesadillas were permeated with onions and spicy, spicy soggy green peppers (which I don't recall as being warned of those on the menu) so I took one bite and couldn't eat any more of it. It was gross and waaayyy too spicy for me to eat. The only thing I liked was my husband's strawberry margarita, which had booze in it, compared to my non alcoholic version (I'm pregnant). I had a sip of his and it was yummy. My daughter drank most of mine. She ate a lot of chips and wouldn't touch my quesadilla. We won't bother eating there again. What a bummer.",1
review_629048,restaurant,"Today was my second trip to Merci, third if you count when it went by a different name. Every time they have been out of croissants with plenty of time before they close. They're always asking if we want to wait 25 minutes for them to cook. Why don't you just keep making croissants? I heard our server ask two other parties if they also wanted to wait! Don't stop making croissants until it's closer to closing time! We were two hours from close and our server suggested we call ahead so they can set some aside for is next time. Unbelievable.\n\nFor a breakfast sandwich, the replacement starch is their delicious French bread. It's fantastic but you only get one piece and instead of it being built like a sandwich, it's a mini omelette on a piece of bread.\n\nI've also had their burger. I asked for medium and received a greasy well-done chewy burger. The fries looked like they'd soaked in oil overnight and the burger came with an herby mayo that tasted nice but was not represented on the menu. \n\nI was going to give this three stars because of the French bread, the macaroons and the friendly staff but the rest of the food just isn't that great. I was also told that my macaroon purchase wasn't the best and I wasn't too happy with that reaction. I'm hoping their dinner specials are better than the brunch but I will not be returning to find out.",1

review_174187,restaurant,Not sure what all the fuss is about. It's a medium priced for Las Vegas and very noisy dinning establishment. So loud you can't talk to the people across the table from you. My sea bass was good but not wonderful. Cold in the middle but never could get the servers attention. There was a corn pudding that was cold and smeared on the plate as what appeared to be an afterthought.  My husband said his steak was good but not wonderful. They do give you a nice basket of bread and olive spreads before. With all the restaurants in Las Vegas this is not a hit. It's like a celebrity chef gave it his name and went away and said who cares,2
review_200523,restaurant,YESSS. I am truly blessed to live across the street from the Pita Jungle. This is one of the few places in Scottsdale with a good selection of non-meats. I'm fairly sure they've imported the attractive hipster waitstaff from Tempe as they look adorably out of place in this neighborhood. My favorite dish is the One Thousand Beans hot pita and I do believe it has nearly ONE THOUSAND BEANS! For about $8 it feeds me for three meals.,3

review_411000,restaurant,"Was extremely psyched to try Lobby's, considering all of the great reviews, but I was sadly disappointed with the results. I'm a freak for Chili burgers (good ones are very difficult to find) and The Lobby's Chili burger was fairly dull, featured Cinci style Chili (BLAH) and like. some sort of cheese whiz kinda crap.  Boo. Also ordered fries, and a Chicago dog.. the Chicago dog was overpriced and forgettable, and the crinkle cut fries were reminiscent of Del Taco's.. which isn't exactly a bad thing, but considering that Lobby's is supposed to be a tasty, quality burger place, frozen crinkle fries are kind of a half assed approach.. ALSO the amount of salt on the fries was enough to invoke a stroke! :x  Finally whoever dude was that handed me my bag of food was all like ZIPPY DOO I GAVE YOU A CUP OF FRENCH FRY SAUCE.. There were two orders of fries.. one cup of sauce.. which was just basic secret sauce.. not super great... secret sauce, to boot.. Thanks bro, but I don't need any secret sauce favors.",1

review_489610,restaurant,"We came here as we were staying at the Cosmopolitan.  This is a gourmet burger place.  I like their idea of selling shakes with alcohol. The wife had the surf & turf mini burgers and I had a burger with Kobe beef, potato chips and cheddar cheese (can't remember the name of the burger). We also had the Oreo shake with Baileys and kettle chips with blue cheese and French onion dipping sauce.  The surf & turf wasn't very good as it had this tiny piece of lobster with beef tenderloin.  The Kobe burger was good with a nice crunch from the potato chips but it feel short compared to other gourmet burgers I've had.  The Oreo shake was good but had very little alcohol.  A beer would've been better with the burger rather than the milk shake.  The potato chips were a good starter for our meal.  I'm glad we tried this place but not sure if we would come back.",2

review_242440,restaurant,"Super greasy pizza is not my thing.  That perfect, just-the-right-amount-of- grease, well THAT is an entirely different story!  LOL! \n\nLuckily, that is what Spinatos is....just the right amount of grease and Chicago Style Pizza!  Their Fresh \""Signature\"" Spinach pizza is something that gives you CRAVINGS- even if you are not hormonal.  Honestly, if you like roasted garlic, you will LOVE this pizza.  They have another spinach one that everyone at our office went ga-ga over, but to me, the Fresh Signature Spinach is even more spectacular. \n\nYummy salads (HUGE portions- even the individual ones are enough for several people).  Good service- mostly friendly staff (the one unhappy older blond lady hasn't been there for awhile, so I am hopeful that the sole grump who worked there is gone!)  \n\nGood prices.  We like to order a pizza with half grown-up-ish, and half cheese (the kids like their traditional thin crust better than the kid's portion individual cheese pizza's which are a thicker crust).  Many pizza places charge you for the more expensive half, but Spinatos charges you the middle price (between the expensive and inexpensive halves).  Little things like this make you feel appreciated and not taken advantage of.  And it is just a plain ol' fair thing to do.  \n\nSo if you like Chicago Style Pizza (what on earth is the difference between Chicago and New York style anyway?), then you will really like Spinatos.  \n\nHappy eating!\n\nWarmly,\n\nKirin :)",3

review_448199,restaurant,"I first had Slidin' Thru this summer and it was a great experience.  A fist bump for everyone!  Plus a vegetarian friendly slider!  With my all-time favorite mozzarella!\n\nThe slider was awesome and the balsamic reduction really sealed the deal for me.  The best part?  It was like 7 bucks for 3 sliders.  It was a steal!\n\nI've seen Slidin' Thru a couple times at other events (StrEATs, First Friday) but they've had a limited menu with nothing for my vegetarian belly.  I sadly had to walk by and dream of a Caprese slider for another day.\n\nI finally caught up with them again a couple weeks ago and noticed that their menu had giant stickers over the prices (or specifically, over the slider combo prices).  I thought maybe someone played a joke on them and stickered up their ride.  Well after paying $15 for 4 sliders, apparently the joke was on me.   \n\nI'm silently weeping right now as I write this.  Their Caprese sliders were great and I would love to hit them up every time I happen to see their truck.  But, this girl needs to be a little more picky with how she spends her money and sliders aren't exactly filling- so, Slidin' Thru is going to be more of a delicacy.  \n\nFor food and overall experience, I would say 4 or maybe even 5 stars.  But with the new prices I'm going to have to bump them down for now.",2
review_113491,restaurant,"This was my first time at this restaurant with my girlfriend. We dinned last night on Halloween. Let me say I'm a foodie and have eaten at many places around the country. It started off poorly with checking in with the hostess. We arrived early and just wanted to check in. As a customer, I'm not interested about your prior seatings with customers and how stressed you are. No, smile or a welcome. Hostess being very young for the job and not having the appropriate communication skills, maturity, and dress. Granted, this is a college town. However, if I was the owner, first impressions matter. You want someone mature,knowledgeable and dress more classy than casual attire. We waited at the bar and found the bartender staff very nice, professional, and extremely helpful. \nWe were not charged for our drinks after I expressed my discontent to the bartender staff. They were great communicating this to the restaurant staff. Our waiter was great. However, the food quality does not meet the price they are charging. It's way overpriced. I had the beef tenderloin with a bacon reduced sauce. It was way to salty and the beef had a line of tough connective tissue in the middle. Not prime meat!! Seen better at Costco. \nThe bathroom floor was slightly wet and looked dirty. The exhaust vent had loads of dust. Overall, this restaurant claims to be slightly upscale and prices its dishes as such. It misses the mark in many small ways. If I was the owner, I would review hostess job, clean the bathrooms, food quality needs to be examined better when coming from kitchen. I doubt prices will change. It's a nice location. It just needs a little better attention to details. I probably won't go back again. Their are other restaurants with better quality.",1
review_397070,restaurant,"We visit Los Favs at least 2 times a week, and for the price and the overall good, consistent quality, you really can't beat it.

Their red hot sauce is the best, I do agree with the other reviewer that the guac could be a bit better, but it's a small price to pay overall.",3

The shredded beef tacos are good too.\n\nSome of the other things are a miss....the chimichangas are bad...from the shrimp and the chicken they are just bland.\n\nService is good and our server pepe was great.\n\nI would go again...although I think san francisco has better mexican food.",2

I could only eat half. Now I have never had a Torta before so I have nothing to compare it to, But it was delish, my wife has a burrito which she also liked. Service was excellant, very friendly staff. They were playing Vicente Fernandez videos on the flat screens why we were there for luch providing some background ambience.

review_216393,restaurant,"I hate being that guy that gives a place with great reviews a not so great review. I see this place has amazing reviews, my wife used to go here years ago on a regular basis and she's told me how amazing the burgers were and so I expected an amazing burger. Boy, was I disappointed.\n\nWe started with the cheese curds. They were OK, but nothing spectacular. I ordered Green Chili Bacon Cheeseburger. I honestly think I've had a better burger at In-n-Out and maybe even McDonald's. When the waitress took our order she didn't ask either my wife or myself how we wanted it cooked and both of us forgot to mention it. I don't know if they usually don't ask, but I do sort of expect that when I order a burger. My thinking is if they don't ask, they only serve it one way, and if that is the way I received mine then I don't know how this place gets raves for their burgers. It was well done, completely overcooked, charred on the outside and not juicy at all. In my book, juicy is they key component of a great burger. The patty itself was fairly small and dwarfed by the bun. As my wife said, charge a buck more and add some ground beef. My wife's basic hamburger was the same way - charred, overcooked and dry. The bun was good, though. The fries were also very good but not good enough to make me go back just for the fries. The fries are a side show to the main event of the burger.\n\nAs for the service, it started out OK and stayed there. I ordered a Blue Paddle beer. When the server delivered it she asked if I would like an orange to go with it. I said yes but it never showed up. Our water was refilled as needed, which was nice although expected. We did have to wait a while for our check because our server was out on the patio smoking (I know because I watched her). I understand everyone needs a break but IMHO she was out there too long.\n\nI wanted the experience, particularly the food, to be better and according to my wife it used to be fantastic. Either we had a really off night or it's just gone downhill since she's been there. Maybe we'll try it again but as my wife said \""There are too many other choices and other places to try out there.\"" I was going to rate this one star, but I'm giving it two simply because everyone else has such amazing things to say. Perhaps it really was just a bad day to stop in. Maybe someday when it's just me I'll swing by, hoping I have a better burger. It couldn't be any worse...",1

So good, in fact that we drive from Desert Ridge over to where they are and get take out.\n\nWe ordered the first time and asked for delivery and they agreed.  But none of us knew where the other was -- it took the poor guy 40 minutes to deliver it to us and he just kept apologizing.  Dude - our fault for sure!\n\nTheir Moo Shoo Pork is to die for and their fried rice is fresh and yummy.  When I tell you we order $75 in Chinese take-out, you can imagine how much food that it.  We've had their honey Garlic Chicken, Almond Chicken, Beef Lo Mein (a total fav), both pork and beef fried rice, and the soups.  One thing we had that we weren't nuts about was the orange beef, not bad, just didn't love it.   As for appetizers, we LOVE their crab puffs - and i want some now as I'm typing.  Had the egg roll, and eh, it was just an eggroll.\n\nI would definitely recommend New Asian Kitchen to anyone who likes fresh and tastey Chinese food.  I keep telling them they should open up a location in Desert Ridge - heck, we'd probably keep them in business all by ourselves!",3
review_297875,restaurant,"Easter Brunch I spent on the patio of Ristorante Tuscany @ JW Marriott Desert Ridge.  They of course did not have there traditional menu, but a prix fixe menu for the brunch since they are not typically open on Sundays.    Sitting on the patio over looking a large water feature with lush greens and beautiful blue skies, almost made one feel as if they were not in a desert.  Claudio and Juleen were taking care of us this day and I have to say...they were fantastic!!  Personal and friendly, they never let the Proseco stop flowing!!  \n\nThe meal began with a buffet of Antipasto...so many different cheeses, salami's, prosciutto, figs, grilled vegetables, salad with dates (it was like I was home having Easter dinner at my Mom's).  I choose the salmon appetizer off the menu as well as the crab cake benedict (Claudio also  brought a piece of the lobster and caviar strata for the table to share)  The Salmon was done perfectly with a little dijon sauce it was enjoyable.  I tried my friends flat bread with mushrooms and this was also delicious.  It was amazing that it was an appetizer as  it was a whole rectangular pizza.  The crab cake benedict was a bit salty for my tasting.  However the lobster and caviar strata was fantastic!  I also tried the Kobe beef and mushrooms...delicious.  And the Proseco was still flowing.\n\nDesert was served in the wine cellar.  And of course I had to try a little of everything!  \n\nWhat I did truly enjoy was that this was a slow dining experience.  They did not rush you and actually let the food digest before another course was presented.\n\nA beautiful setting.  Fantastic people taking care of you. And of course delicious food.  What other better way to spend a Sunday for brunch.",3

TOTALLY GROSS\n* The Salsa for Chips and Salsa was bland and we asked if they had a spicier Salsa and they let us know they had not made their Spicy Salsa yet.  It was 12:30.  She offered Jalapenos for our Salsa for a FEE.\n* The Waitress was rude and no other servers want to help any other table.\n* I asked the person who brought out the Food for a fork and he looked annoyed and didn't bring it.\n* The Rice in the Rice and Beans side dish was not fully cooked. I let the waitress know and she brought the same thing back and was rude when I asked her to take it back and cancel the side.\n* Everything is Overpriced.  A simple Chicken Burrito is $16!\n\nI understand Vegas pricing but Hair in my food, Salsa and Rice unprepared and it was close to 1PM when the food was served, and RUDE Service was just too unreasonable!",0
review_409847,restaurant,"This was my first stop after my plane landed at PHX on Sunday afternoon.  After I managed to get lost about 20 times in the huge Scotsdale Fashion Center, I finally managed to find the little blue window for Modern Burger.  I picked up two sliders and a side of fries.  The have two small tables right next to the ordering window, so I was able to dig in right away.  I thought the burgers were really good, which is impressive since I don't really like American cheese.  My leftovers were still delicious the next day after being warmed up in my hotel microwave.  Definitely worth the drive!",3
review_570454,restaurant,"I'll make this easy. This is the best buffet in Vegas, maybe the USA. It's pricey, but definitely worth it. We ate here on a Thursday night so we did have to wait about 45 min. The selection is overwhelming, from custom tacos, to Kobe sliders, to scalloped potatoes with truffle sauce...you really have to scout the buffet  once you are there, don't start taking food...be strategic. Most importantly, leave room for dessert. This buffet is utterly amazing....",4
review_288738,restaurant,"I hadn't been to this restaurant in years, since a. I lived out of state and b. When PA changed the laws they continued to allow smoking upstairs and I'm highly allergic. I found out they finally stopped allowing smoking anywhere inside and decided to try them again.\n\nI attend a lot of Penguins games & concerts and normally go just down the street to eat/drink before the game with friends and family. Since I go straight from work, I'm always the first to arrive. No one else has an issue with seating me alone to wait for the rest of my party. Though the Souper Bowl was EMPTY (so empty that I was wandering around alone with no one greeting me and the next person in the restaurant thought I was the one working) at this time. \n\nThough there was almost no one there (me and this other woman, who took a couple of menus and seated herself), when I mentioned that there were two in my party and we needed to see the Pirates game, the woman weirdly (and rudely) asked if they were THERE NOW... Um... Clearly not. She could see it was just me. I told her I could show her texts and my boyfriend was on his way. The woman next to her (older and presumably higher on the food chain) said something about me being \""that way\"" already (which confused me - they were accusing ME of not really having a party of two, making it clear that if I were there alone, which I sometimes am at restaurants before shows no one else wants to attend with me - like the ballet or gymnastics) they would NOT want my business... Anyway, the second woman explained that they didn't seat until the whole party was present. (I can see why - like I said, they were PACKED... NOT.) As I started to walk away, she said they may be able to help me upstairs. No thanks. I went back down the street to The Cafe on 5th where they've never had ANY problem seating me alone (whether I'll later be a table of 2, 4, or more) and treat me very well. I don't need to pay to be treated rudely.\n\nThere was a Pirates game before the Penguins game last night, so I'm sure the Souper Bowl was completely packed. However, I attend a LOT of games and I'm just as sure that's not always the case. I'll never return. They clearly didn't care about my business that night, but I am telling all my friends and my Dad and his girlfriend attend a lot of games (and drink a lot), too. He'll stick with the Cafe on 5th, too.\n\nNo clue if the food is good or not and I don't care. I'd much rather be treated like a person the restaurant/bar would like to serve than someone they couldn't care less about. The feeling is mutual. Beware.",0

review_373207,restaurant,Staff was friendly and welcoming. Was excited to try this place after finding it on yelp with rave reviews. That being said I was underwhelmed. The food (or what I had) was just ok. \n\nI've read this is ilocano style food so it's not the exact style I grew up eating. We ordered adobo chicken fried rice omelet and a combo plate of pork adobo and pancit bihon. The omelet was good. The pork adobo had more vinegar and less soy than I cared for and pancit was bland and kinda dry. I know adobo is regional and I'll get a different adobo based on who is making it. It was good just not what I like. \n\nWas going to attempt the buffet but the food looked so sad sitting under that heat lamp. \n\nOverall it was just alright. I may go back to try the lechon and sinigang but not any time soon. I'll stick to kapit bahay for now.,2
review_70796,restaurant,"Nothing special. Not a great breakfast place and their Italian dinner items are bland. Went twice. Never again. On my second visit we went with another couple that had an Entertainment Book coupon. The staff wouldn't allow us to sit together and use both coupons. (Only one coupon per table, they said, although that wasn't specified on the coupon.) So our friends had to sit at a table next to us and we shouted at each other to have a conversation. Ridiculous.\n\nPlus their highly touted banana bread reeks of artificial banana flavoring, not fresh bananas; and their special potatoes (served instead of standard hash browns) are like thick, hard, and slightly greasy potato chips.\n\nI don't get the couple of enthusiastic reviews here. Perhaps they have a storied past, but for a Vegas newcomer (two months) this isn't even up to a Denny's standard.",0
review_200332,restaurant,"I stayed at the Mirage over the weekend for a bachelor party and that saturday evening we had reservations at Stack. We had 30 people with us and the waiters did an excellent job of taking our drinks, taking food orders and making sure our requests were filled. I started with the lobster tacos which was small but tasty, shared the Ultimate steak which was cooked to perfection, our sides were also excellent. I ordered medium rare and it was cooked perfectly on both sides of the 40 oz porterhouse steak. We had a small army and everything went smoothly for dinner. Talk about attention to detail, I step out of my table and ordered a drink at the bar because I was meeting someone and it was automatically billed to my table. You couldn't even see my table from the bar. I felt like VIP. I would definately come here again for steak.",4

I had pizza and it was pretty decent, though the crust was a bit thicker than I'd prefer on a thin-crust pizza, but that's a minor quibble. My girl had an eggplant parmesan sandwich that looked terrific and she loved it. Old, low-rent surroundings, but good, friendly service, spotless restrooms, and good food. Would do it again.",3

review_462034,restaurant,"After getting our flex on at the gym, Mikey Elite ops for KoMex. At first the thought of this fusion restaurant wasn't jiving with me. The \""hear says\"" and reviews weren't bullshit'n!\n\nOff the bat, the nice lady asks if we checked-in. Free fried wontons! Come up! I love Yelp supporting establishments. EYE LIKA CHU PEOPLES!!!\n\nThey offer four different types of hot sauces. The green and red chille sauce that usually is seen at a taco joint. I think the other two were Korean and Chinese hot sauces. \n\nWe got beef tacos, a beef tostada, and a beef chimichanga. The tacos were fat and delicious. I like how you can opt for a lettuce wrap instead of a tortilla.  The tostada had a fried ricecake for its' base. It complimented the bulgogi chill'n on top with the herbs and spices. I had a sample of the bulgogi chimichanga. It was cheesy and delicioso. \n\nAlthough everything was awesome, the tacos were the winner for me. They've placed 2nd on my taco favorites.

review_174042,restaurant,"During our trip to Vegas we knew we wanted to indulge in at least ONE good meal for our anniversary. We decided to go to Todd English's Olives Restaurant at the Bellagio and I'm so glad we did. With so many restaurants to choose from in Vegas, we were sold by the delicious-sounding menu and the reviews of the Lump Crab Beignets...on with it. \n\nSo we started with the Lump Crab Beignets -- absolutely delicious! I've had nothing like these crispy little balls of goodness. You must try this. You won't be disappointed.\n\nWe also ordered the Kobe Beef Tartare -- although it was good, it was not our favorite part of our meal simply because the competition was fierce! :)\n\nI ordered the Pork Chop with Clam Sauce -- OH EM GEE. The absolute BEST pork chop you'll ever sink your teeth into. I typically don't order pork chops, but I'm so happy I decided to be daring that night. I fell in love as soon as I cut into that crispy chop and fed myself a piece that was equal parts juicy white meat and straight up fatty goodness. There's nothing worse than a lean, dry pork chop. BO-RING. This hit the spot and that clam sauce was so good. Hubby was jealous.\n\nHe ordered the Braised Beef which was your standard tender goodness you'd expect from a braised beef -- a sure winner for those not-so-adventurous types. \n\nFor dessert we ordered their Cookies & Milk Gelato platter -- so tasty and so clever, and get this...they even wrote \""Happy Anniversary\"" in chocolate. Bonus points for attention to detail!\n\nOne of the highlights of Olives is you can request seating that allows you to watch the water show during dinner. The place is packed and pretty dim, but service was did not suffer. \n\nThank you for a memorable Anniversary Dinner, Olives! We hope to visit you again soon.",3
review_194784,restaurant,"Food is my biggest weakness. Sometimes I won't even be hungry but will be drawn to eating something because 1. I've never tried it before or 2. because I wont have the chance elsewhere and well this was the case for In-n-out last week in Vegas.\n\nWe had eaten breakfast at Egg and I that morning and I had stuffed my face with pancakes, bacon, and eggs so I was planning on a light dinner. I spent the rest of the morning driving around and buying foodie goodies at random places I had bookmarked (Popped and Bouchon Bakery) So there had been close to NO exercise being done. \n\nWhen I got back to the hotel one of the first things my sister suggested we  do is go to in-n-out....She had just woken up from a 4 hour nap and she wants fast food? I was close to saying Sorry, no. But wait it's your 2nd to last day and you already decided your bringing Earls on the plane you won't have another chance said a devil voice in my head. Okay I said, let's go.\n\nAs we walked into In-N-Out  I was instantly transported back in time. The decor, the uniforms, the basic menu were all so 50's. I was a little\nsurprised to see how simple the menu was but better for me, less decisions to make. Although I probably would have just stuck to fries at any other fast food place else my inner devil foodie demanded I try a burger so I went with the combo 1, a cheeseburger and fries. \n\nMy sister ordered before and got the infamous animal fries which I thought were only lathered with their special sauce...WRONG. They had melted cheese, the special sauce and grilled onions. Heartattack on the spot. :-) \n\nHonestly I wish I had gone a little hungrier because although I was able to eat half my burger and 1/4 of the fries I didn't get to enjoy it as much as I may have after a night of drinking or on an empty stomach....Regardless, it was fresh fresh fresh for fast food and I was happy to see a guy making the fries from potatoes in the back..\n\nI think next time I'll stick to an animal burger and regular fries..\n\nI also have never seen such hard workers at a fast food joint, which definitely earns a star in my book! \n\nYELP 365: 162/365",4

It was tender and juicy, and not at all rubbery. I know the last time I had carne asada it was rubbery, but that was also from a 'bertos joint. I enjoyed the way this place is set up. Walk up to the counter, order and they bring you your food. It is quick and efficient. We got the dinner for 2, 2 tacos, 2 burritos, chips and drinks for $20. The tacos were great, as were the burros. I will definitely be back. \n\nOh the 5 stars are specifically for the quick, efficient service... and the BEST carne asada around.",4

review_639669,restaurant,"All I have to say is: It's about...damnnn time! My friends and I always, always make a stop here when we visit Las Vegas.  But to finally open here is pretty much a dream come true.  \n\nThey are the best in the business of crawfish and other cajun style seafood.  I can finally say there's a great place in town I can take visitors to if they never had Cajun food or even a seafood boil for that matter.\n\nLet's start off by talking about their crawfish! They are consistently fresh.  They pretty much perfected their secret recipe to a science.  The temperature and sauce is spot on.  I love my seafood HOT and SAUCY.  The garlic and Cajun spices truly pack a punch.  \n\nIf you are new to this, I highly suggest starting off with the crawfish since that is what they are known for.  If you just hate digging your nails into hard shells, then shrimp might be your next best option.  The beauty of eating this type of seafood is to taste the freshness from the sea.\n\nI always, almost order 2lbs worth of crawfish.  Why? You get free corn, potato, and sausages fused with heavenly Cajun flavors. \n\n A trick I love doing is to order a side of rice and making a poor man style gumbo.  As you are peeling your seafood, take the juices, like guts or brains from your seafood and dump it into you rice and let it build.  At the end, tear up some sausages and pour in your left over Cajun juice from your boil onto the rice.  Voila! Enjoy!\n\nSince they just recently opened, now is probably a good time to get your crawfish fix before the word is out.  There is a bit of wait during dinner time.  First come first serve.  Don't worry its worth the wait.  I hope they will open more around the valley.  I will probably eat here atleast once a month.",4
review_51525,restaurant,"I've been here twice now, and both times have been great. They actually make the food spicy when you ask for it and it tastes authentic. I've had the panang curry and the papaya salad, both of which have been fantastic. I can't wait to try their pad thai next time",3

review_132786,restaurant,"My sister told me to check this place out because she heard they had a really good steak special - $6.99 for a 10 oz steak. She said it was off the beaten path and more of a locals, low-end kind of place. It might have some of the old school Vegas charm left in it. I'm happy to say that it did. \n\nThe place looks like it hasn't been redecorated in a good 30 or more years. Cement floors, red vinyl seats, lots of wood paneling, cheap drinks - and the $6.99 special! The special is not on the menu, so you have to ask for it. Practically everyone who was dining there was eating it. They start you off with a basic green salad which is iceberg lettuce and tomatoes. Then they serve your steak with a choice of potato (I had mashed) and their vegetable. I was a little disappointed by the steak. I ordered mine medium rare and instead it was more like medium well-done. But for the price, I can't complain. The special also includes a beer since Ellis Island is also a microbrewery. You have your choice of lager, amber, or stout. The mashed potatoes were decent and the vegetables also. Definitely good cheap Vegas eats! I'm a fan and I would return here.",3
review_389901,restaurant,"Lunch was a hit! We decided on The Parlor over St. Francis today just because I had been hearing so many great reviews. I wanted to check it out for myself! \n\nMy guest ordered the steak panzanella salad with delicious focaccia croutons! The steak was dressed with a romesco sauce and was delicious. The flat iron steak was prepared, just as recommended, medium rare. I ordered the funghi 8\"" pizza. The perfect size for one or for a lunch meal. The mushrooms were a great blend of different types and prepared perfectly. Roasted, the mushrooms were still firm but cooked as well. I said goodbye to the soggy mushrooms in my life a long time ago. The flavor of goat cheese was a great compliment to the truffle oil and mushrooms on this dish. Although the pizza was a bit greasy, it was still flavorful and I had no problem devouring the whole thing!  \n\nContinuing my quest for restaurants and bars with the best Moscow Mule's, I opted for a cocktail with lunch. With expectations high for my drink, I was let down when my drink was brought out in a bar glass. Where's the copper mug? I enjoyed the cocktail but I prefer the traditional mule in the cup!",2
review_570303,restaurant,Bacchanal Buffet is an absolutely superior buffet!! EVERY single dish was incredibly delicious. I am not a fan of trying normal dishes at LV buffets just because I like to try things I normally wouldn't. However I did try the Mac and cheese and\nIt was delicious as well. I found it hilarious that something so simple could be made to have such a delicious taste. We  went with a party of eight therefore they automatically added the 18% tip.  I was not surprised being most restaurants do that nowadays. I am happy to say that every single person in our party agreed it was the best buffet in LV. It was such a nice experience. Everything about the restaurant is awesome. Additionally I enjoyed their decoration and the way the food is presented. I cannot say enough great things about this place definitely worth the price considering there are other buffets that cost nearly the same and are not close to being as good! Can't wait to be in Las Vegas again so that I can come to this buffet again!!,4

review_500357,restaurant,"This place serves disgusting food at a high price.  There is also a creepy, male-dominated atmosphere that I find offensive.  The waitresses seem cowed.  \n\nTheir \""meat\"" sauce and \""meat\"" balls contain pork, but the menu doesn't mention that.  If you get chicken with your pasta, it will be served as a whole breast that is cut into thick strips and placed on top of the pasta.  The chicken looks and tastes nasty and old.  I almost thought I was eating a chicken tumor, rather than an actual breast.  I imagine the Upper Crust head chef picking out the tumor at the market, throwing it in his backpack, and then riding to work on his bicycle before preparing it for me.\n\nI asked for some basil to lighten up the very heavy flavor of the tomato-cream linguini.  They gave me some and charged me a buck.  When I am paying $25 for some noodles, cheap sauce, and a tumor, I think they should give me the basil for free.  The fact that I asked for the basil indicates that the food isn't very good, and they should care about that.\n\nSorry, Upper Crust, but I will be stepping out and paying you no heed in the future.",0

review_559415,restaurant,"Great after work bar - not so great BBQ. \n\nFor my meal I ordered the brisket with sides of collards and potato salad. \n\n\nThe brisket has the chewy/dry consistency of reheated meat. Also, there is no identifiable smoke ring, which is the hallmark of smoked meat. Whatever smokey taste I get is on the surface and appears to be smoke flavoring applied as part of a very light rub. Overall low on flavor. I am very disappointed - especially since the name of the place is \""Smoke.\"" On the upside the \""brisket sauce\"" is tasty and complements the brisket well, but mostly as hydration. \n\nThe collards have the familiar vinegary, sweet, hot taste that I like and has ham bits well incorporated for flavor. Overall a good side for those who enjoy collard greens. \n\nThe potato salad is forgettable. It appears to be some version of baked potato salad.  It contains celery, green onions, small chunks of red potatoes, a scant few bits of bacon, and is made creamy by what tastes like a mixture of sour cream and mayo. Some may enjoy it, but it was too creamy for me - I can barely taste any potato in the mix. \n\nOverall an unimpressive experience, but since it is conveniently located - in the same building as where I work - and the beer selection is decent I will probably give another main dish and sides a try on a less motivated day.",1

With direct competition across the street I expected more of an effort to keep potential repeat business. I have repeatedly not been greeted in a friendly manner, been engaged as a customer, or thanked for my business in any way. I work in the service industry and understand and value of taking care of your regulars. I will not be returning to this restaurant with other options in the immediate vicinity.",0
review_498964,restaurant,"Second time here was not as pleasant as the first visit. This was during restaurant week. I loved dining the first time and was excited to dine the second time. This time around I tried the Bacon Fat Heirloom Popcorn for $5, their Fair Trade Short Ribs which is prepared with a coffee rub, dried cherry bbq sauce, roasted parsnip puree & seasonal veggies for $30; and their Bread Pudding for $6.\nThe Bacon Fat Heirloom Popcorn was regular popcorn with bacon bits and fat. If you're a bacon lover you might want to taste this. It's a simple snack to munch on while reviewing the rest of the menu. \nHmm how shall I put this ....... I can only equate the entree dish to nothing but \""Fair\"" - exactly as it says!! And I didn't get a fair trade at all either for $30. It was coffee rubbed so dry and over cooked that my jaws  were gnawing on each piece pretending to like that darn meat! I dipped each piece in the cherry BBQ sauce but it was still parched and punishing experience to the mouth.\nLuckily I had asked for the bread pudding which was well hydrated served with strawberries and cream. This is a restaurant week dessert not in their main menu. \n\nThe final straw of the evening was the check for a party of 9. At the bottom of their menu it states in fine print: Split checks unavailable for parties larger than 8. First of all, the waitress allowed one person in the group to have their own separate check leaving 8 people left. If you allowed one person then you must do for the rest at the same table.  Was she afraid she wouldn't get her 20% or more gratuity? If the waitress allowed one person in the group to have their own check the group becomes 8 people or less. Which means we CAN technically split the check any which way. Instead the waitress proceeds to tell us she can't do that. And on top of that she proceeds to tell us that we need to calculate our own tax and tip!! You mean to tell us that a nice sophisticated restaurant lacks a POS system with zero capabilities of generating the math for you?!?!?! \nHere's another kicker: At the bottom of the original receipt the waitress hand wrote herself a 20% gratuity. Again, the POS system lacked being able to incorporate the added gratuity on a receipt and the total cost. I find that a shocker. After the whole fiasco and doing our own calculations and making it inconvenient for us diners we were glad it was over. The experience overall was a disaster but the bacon popcorn and bread pudding made up for a bit of it. \nMaybe a hit and miss type of deal. :/\nNever dine here with a group more than 8.",1
review_262163,restaurant,Great restaurant with a nicely decorated small dining area. I kept reading about the great lunch specials and the free Thai iced tea with check in. So I made my way there today and was greeted by a very nice gentleman who quickly serviced my table and obliged me with me free Thai tea with check in. They started me with a yummy little soup and I ordered the green curry chicken lunch special for $5.50; it came with a chicken potsticker that had a yummy sauce. I ordered my curry a 6 and took half of my nicely portioned lunch to go. It was so spicy my ears starting tingling and my lips were lightly singing. Lol. Definitely a delicious spot to visit and re-visit. Love it!!!,4
review_373341,restaurant,"Scramble is a really great place to have breakfast exactly the way you want it. I love the modern atmosphere and the do-it-yourself coffee and drink bar in the center of the restaurant. My only complaint was that it was fairly busy when we ate there (fairly busy, not overly packed or even busy enough to cause stress to the staff) and the man taking our order at the register was rushing us and behaved in a very unprofessional and impolite way. The rest of the staff was friendly and polite, however, and the food was terrific.",4
review_205908,restaurant,"I rarely give any place 5 stars, but this place get my vote.  If you like Asian fusion food and are looking for a nice place to dine, consider this place.\n\nAt first, I was really hesitant to go to this restaurant.  The name is a bit strange and inside Treasure Island?  Not exactly the hippest hotel compare to the newer ones out there.  After getting past these thoughts, I checked out this restaurant only because I had heard that is was a celebrity favorite.  OK, I was sold.\n\nThe decor inside is very eclectic, modern and unique.  Old world meets modern today.  Great layout perfect for a large group or dinner for 2.  Just make sure that you make reservations!\n\nI had little expectations, but was pleasantly surprised with the foods that we shared.  I highly recommend the Kobe Burgers which are like fusion sliders which will be enjoyed by all.  Every table surrounding ours ordered these as well.  There was also a wonderful miso flavored white fish.  This was one of the best fishes that I have every tried.  Sweet, comlex and delicious.  Although I am a huge fan of fried food, I would stay away from it here.  I thought that some of the dishes that were deep fried just missed the mark and weren't that special.  Skip those all together, but don't skip dessert!\n\nThey also have delicious fruit infused sake.  I am not a fan of sake, but am a fan of these lightly infused and fruit sweetened concoctions.  These are a must try.  It may be due to the fact that they actually used premium sake and not cheap bitter stuff that you would normally get at everyday sushi places.\n\nTIP: If you are looking for something to do after dinner, talk to your waiter.  They will be able to provide you with instant access to Tangerine Nightclub with no cover and no wait.  No a bad deal.",4
review_606342,restaurant,"Worst ribs ever. I think my ribs had been sitting around for days. It was like \""rib jerky\"". You know, dehydrated and leathery.\n\nThe brisket was rubbery and flavorless. kind of the same stuff you would expect boiled from an English Pub. the brisket also had a sitting-around-for-days vibe. I guess Dickey's believes that BBQ sauce will cure bad cooking.\n\none side we had was the jalapeno beans. these were spectacularly awesome. best beans ever. it's not cut up pieces of peppers on top of beans. rather, the jalapenos have been sauced and the beans have been infused with the mouth watering essence of the peppers.\n\nThe 'Q couldn't stand on its own. it was just another Dickey's food that went nowhere without BBQ sauce.\n\nThe sauces are standard issue, run of the mill, middle of the road, forgettable.\n\nSkip this place.",0
review_363211,restaurant,"mmkay well im only writing this review because of how delicious my Chicken Alfredo was here. Can't believe nobody has posted a picture or written anything about it thus far (or at least the reviews I read didn't mention it).\n \nYes, it's a pretty generic dish to order. You're probably asking, \""How tasty could it be??\"" I was very surprised by not only the speedy service but also how thoroughly cooked/seasoned the chicken was, pasta were perfect in length and the entire dish not overwhelmed by the Alfredo sauce. \nI could go on an on, i guess just look at the picture I post and imagine it to be 3 times as delicious as it looks?? \n\np.s. portions are huuuge",3

The employee in front was not friendly at all, they forgot about our appetizer (even though he obviously rang it in cuz we were charged for it) so we didn't get it until after our meal, and the tacos were just okay and the nachos sucked!

review_596121,restaurant,"There are a ton of really high reviews here, and I love mexican food so I was excited to try this place out, but my experience doesn't reflect a similar experience. \n\nThe chips were okay, kind of thin and tasted like some cheap supermarket chips. The salsa and beans were alright, not special but not bad at all. The non-custom standard guacamole was really good, but that was about the only thing I had that could be called really good. \n\nMy main meal was the flautas combination plate with grilled veggies. The veggies included broccoli which was absolutely ruined. It was grilled fast on high heat, which ended up just burning and charring the florets, and that's a very bad flavor to add to broccoli. The flautas themselves were okay, not special, I just kind of ate them until I was tired of them and didn't take home any leftovers. I feel like that's almost worse than giving me bad food. At least make me have an opinion about it, right? The shell was also cooked a bit too much, so was hard to cut through.\n\nThe wife was also unhappy with her meal, I forget what exactly she got but the tortilla it was wrapped in was super soggy on the bottom and not all that pleasant to eat. \n\nThe staff, however, was great. They were very attentive and treated us great. I'll definitely give this place a second chance for sure, if for no other reason than to try their custom guacamole option made table-side. Hopefully this was just a bad outing and they will live up to all these other high praise reviews next time.",1
review_279434,restaurant,"I've been here probably a hundred times. I love it here. With only one exception in the many times I've been here, the service has always great regardless of who our server is. The food is always consistently good, I've tried probably half the menu and have yet to experience something that wasn't enjoyable.\nI think what really prompted me to write this review (though it's been a long time coming) is that I was working late one night when I saw that the chef had posted a description of that night's special on Facebook. They do it all the time (I assume daily) but this dish really caught my eye. It was an Asian inspired dish which is a bit different than usual. It had chicken meatballs, noodles, veggies and a sweet and spicy broth.\nI called to order it for take-out and the person on the phone taking my order told me she would have to check if that dish was available for take out since it was soup. She puts me on hold and a minute or two later and Chef Jason himself gets on the phone with me to tell me how he is going to package the dish (noodles/veggies/meatballs in one container and broth in another container) and explains he's doing it that way to keep it from getting soggy and making a mess on the drive home. He even told me how to prepare it when I got home.\nI loved that he took that extra minute and gave me personal attention that I didn't request or even know I needed. It was that extra care and attention that really set Switch apart from it's competitors.",4
review_632078,restaurant,Delicious food. Great atmosphere. The food and wine were a revelation but the highlight of the night was definitely the luxurious cheese plate. I would go back just for the cheese selection! \n\nMy only complaint is that the prices were on the steep side.,3
review_101837,restaurant,"We went on Friday night about 8:30 and found the place about 10% full... A far cry from my last few visits when we had to wait for a table. It was cold out, so we decided to sit by the fire on the patio. Looked around and none of the candles were lit on the tables... We lit our own. There was already a menu on the table when we sat down, not for us, it just happened to be at the table closest to the fire when we seated ourselves. Eventually our server made her way over to us, with no menus (or waters) and gleefully exclaimed \""oh, there's already a menu here... It's a lunch menu, but it's basically all the same stuff.\"" Are my friend and I to share the same menu and choose items hoping they're \""basically the same\"" as what's on the menu?? Seriously? Upon request, she brings us dinner menus and we order a coke and a diet coke. A good while later (remember, the place is essentially empty) she returns with our drinks... A diet coke and an ice water. My friend reminds her that she actually ordered a coke, not water. \""Ooohhhh that's right\"" and she sets off to get the coke. She returns awhile later to take our order... We order the Bresaola salad and the Capricciosa pizza (first, we ask what kind of olives are on the pizza, she says black. So we ask to have no olives, add tomatoes instead). We also remind her of the coke which has yet to arrive. \nAbout 10 minutes goes by and she comes out with our pizza. Our pizza? She sets it on the table and notices the look of confusion on our faces and asks \""did you order something else?\"" I said \""Wow. Yes, the Bresaola\"" she says \""that's right... It's on me, I'll be back with that\"" I said \""okay, I'll take another diet coke and we also need silverware, napkins, plates and we are still waiting on that coke!\"" So as we sit watching our pizza get cold right before our eyes... We notice it's covered in olives. Of coarse it is. But we are okay with it because they are not black olives, like she said, they are kalamata. Once we get everything we need (including the elusive coke, but not my diet refill) and take a bite of our luke warm pizza... Despite not being hot from the oven or what we ordered, it was still pretty tasty. Our appetizer arrives after our entree and it too is d'lish. I remind her about my refill.. \""Oh that's right\"" she says. Again, WOW. \nWe decide on dessert... Tiramisu and a calzone filled with Nutella and bananas topped with vanilla ice cream and 2 espressos. The salad dishes remain on our table as she arrives with our desserts... But there's nowhere to set them down so we start sliding all our dirty dinner dishes around to make room for the new arrivals. Then she leaves, I'm assuming to get our espressos... Now why would I think that? We did only tell her once that we would like them. Indeed, I see her inside not making our coffees and so I get up, walk in and say \""espressos?\"" And she again says \""oh yeah!\"" (Wow) and brings them out and states that these too are on her. I ask for sugar for our coffees (really?) and the bill... It arrives and the salad and espressos were not on the bill but I do see what went wrong with our no olives request for the pizza, it says right below it \""86 the mushrooms\"". Bummer. We love mushrooms. \nI know this review is long and detailed, but to say we had AMAZINGLY BAD service is the understatement of the year. I'll be spending my money at Cibo and Pizzeria Bianco instead, where the food AND the service is always great!",1
review_637344,restaurant,This location is BRAND new...when you walk in the decor is awesome all set up like a true firehouse. It was our first time trying this chain and I admit it was overwhelming at first. We were greeted right away but when advising it was our first time here nobody made a huge effort to assist in our choices. We were helped by someone named Aubrey who was very SWEET and HELPFUL. Problem is she definitely didn't seem to know what  they did or didn't have in stock. We ordered two kids meals and two adult choices. My Mom got a Italian I believe and I got the Chicken Salad - Chopped Salad. Which threw Aubrey off at first as well but I am trying to stay away from bread. Anyhow long story short they were out of Meatballs for the sub I got my son. Now I realize they are new but I just don't see how they weren't more prepared? The manager was nice enough to offer a refund but i just opted for a ham sub for him. He liked it fine but I can't give this place four of five stars when they ran out of chili and Meatballs. It seems like they weren't prepared for the business and if I was advised BEFORE I paid I would of possibly bumped this up to four stars but over all I wasn't WOWED it just literally was OK. The service was really friendly though and the location nice and clean.,2
review_17993,restaurant,"I'll start off by saying Sun Up had amazing food and great beer. The problem lies with the horrible service. There were open tables that needed to be cleaned which caused a bottleneck at the door. We sat at a high top in the bar area and were completely neglected by the bar tender/waitress. We watched tables that sat down at least 20 minutes after us get there food first. We flagged down a waitress to get a status on our food and were told our food takes longer to cook (burger and shrimp tacos), it took about 35 minutes to get food which was clearly resting under a heat lamp for some time. I'm hoping this is a one off on the service because id really like to go back to try more items. I would gladly rate this place a 4 or a 5 if the service was better.",1
review_346565,restaurant,"My wife ordered the salmon and it was very good. I ordered the fish and chips, The fish was very soggy and had very little taste.

review_173268,restaurant,"I really wanted to find a great breakfast during this last trip to Las Vegas. One can get very tired of the standard Eggs/Bacon/Toast combination offered in any of the Casino Properties.\n\nWhen you think Thomas Keller or Bouchon breakfast isn't really what comes to mind. Located on the 10th floor Venezia Tower in The Venetian hotel, Bouchon delivered exactly what I was looking for. As expected the decor was Country French however there was a little bit of Vegas mixed in through vibrant colors in the tile and murals. \n\nWhile standard breakfast fare was certainly available, the menu including the Quiche du Jour , Sourdough Waffles and Croque Madam. I went for an Omlette with sausage, button mushrooms & comte. The perfect fluffy omlette had a great earthy flavor that was truly delightful. It was accompanied by Brioche Toast with house made Cranberry Jam, Hobbs Bacon and a side of Pomme Frites. I am looking forward to my return here in a few months.",4

review_464810,restaurant,"I've patronized Hayashi for lunch(weekday) and dinner(weekend) half-a-dozen times and sat at the bar or in a booth. I am there for the rolls and and not much else.\n\nThere are numerous roll selections. Almost too many for my taste.  The rolls are good, although I usually stay away from any cream cheese contained rolls.  The fish tastes fresh. The eel can be too dry. The \""white\"" fish used in some rolls tends to be very dry when served tempura style. My favourite roll is the Volcano roll: Spicy tuna piled on top of rolls. Seattle roll is good too.\n\nAs far as price, don't kid yourself. $50/person is pretty average. That's 3-4 rolls and two drinks.  Yes, they are $2-$3 more than I'd like them to be but considering the available choices: acceptable.\n\nThe place is very busy on the weekends. I've had lunch during the weekday. It provides a great opportunity to ask the sushi chef questions about what is in the rolls and watch them make it. Considering the small size of their sushi bar and regular bar, service isn't too bad. I've been told there are plans to construct a larger sushi bar. That's good new for customers.\n\nDave at the bar provides great service. Haley is a work horse. Smile more Haley!!! I've only sat at Pua's tables and have nothing but good things to say about her service and roll recommendations.\n\nThe one glaring deficiency is the lack of customer service from management. Roam the floor, greet the customers, ask about the service and food, offer advice to those undecided on what to order. How about having samples to help entice those who are totally lost.\n\nConnect with the customers and we will come back for more.",3

review_3640,restaurant,"Living in Bloomfield, I was excited to finally try some authentic, excellent Italian fare. Unfortunately, I hadn't had much luck so far at Pleasure Bar (okay food), or D'Amico's (awful food). I've had more consistent, tasty Italian at the Olive Garden, which is sad. So I decided to give Alexander's Italian Bistro a try.\n\nWe stopped in tonight, a Saturday evening. The place was pretty much full and we didn't have a reservation, but we got seated after just a few minutes. The tables are packed pretty tight and you can see the servers dancing around each other precariously. The decor is charming without being all tacky like other local Italian places...I love the beautiful backlit stained glass panels that open the space up. There is a nice little bar area in the front with a smaller bar food menu and a couple nice TVs...we'll have to check that out soon.\n\nMr. got the Eggplant Alexander, I got the Mafalda Alexander. The eggplant was nice and crispy, not mushy inside like eggplant parmesan can often turn out. It was very rich and definitely two meals worth of food. My pasta was excellent. The noodles were flavorful on their own, and cooked freshly and perfectly. I like the mafalda noodles, which aren't too commonly used in most Italian places. The sauce, a mixture of marinara and alfredo, was tasty and not overpowering. The spicy Italian sausage was soooo good...just the right amount of spicy, tender and flavorful. They give a pretty large basket of bread that is moist, fresh, and flaky.\n\nWe got the tiramisu for dessert, which was pretty good. It's hard to find real tiramisu anyways so I give them credit for having it. The ladyfingers were a little bit tough to cut with a spoon but they were good, and the cream was very good, not too sweet. A nice finish to the meal.\n\nOnly downsides...no soup or salad included with the dish, those are extra. Our server was nice enough but kinda disappeared when we were finished with our food...we waited around a good 15 minutes for her to come back and wrap Mr.'s leftovers and ask if we wanted dessert, then another 10 minutes after finishing dessert for her to come back with the check. This is one of my top pet peeves.\n\nAlexander himself (I'm pretty sure anyway...) stopped by the table at the end of our meal to ask how everything was, which is always a nice touch in my book. Everyone working there seemed like they must be family, but not the type of family who dread working for the family business, which is nice.\n\nWe'll definitely be back.",3

I asked why it was so much and he told  that the price had changed to $18.99 . I said, \""well I have a non-expired coupon for $16.99.\"" He then said, \""well, the price has changed.\"" I asked to speak to a manager. Manuel (supervisor) got on the phone. I told him I had a coupon and asked that since it was from Hungry Howies and there is no expiration date on it, will they honor it. He, at first said \""no\"",then said \""ok, that's fine, I'll go ahead and give it to you at $16.99. Not a big deal\"" \n\nI chose not to purchase the \""deal\"" only because I was unsure of what they might do to my food.

review_543,restaurant,"Very disappointing meal.  After waiting for a half hour, my meal arrived and we were told that my friend's meal would be coming in a few minutes. Very awkward.t.  Salad was average at best.  The beets tasted like canned beets and the chicken was covered with blackish oil from a burnt oil pan.\n\n  Then, to make matters worse the chef came out to argue with a patron who returned her food.  The chef came out to humiliate the customer explaining that her returned steak was great and himself was enjoying it.  Eating food from a customers plate was a real turn-off....what else does he do when cooking? \n\nTo make matters worse, when paying the bill, the chef did not have change for a $100 bill for the customer who returned her steak..  It was very uncomfortable watching the elderly customer and her young friend deal with the situation. He kept  loudly requesting a credit card  and the women did not have one.   Another customer provided them with change as the chef crumbled the check.

review_229878,restaurant,"I was craving Korean food so drove myself way across town b/c so many people recommended the food.  I have to say, I was sorely disappointed!\n\nI ordered the dolsot bibimbap which is sizzling hot stone bowl filled with rice and topped with a nice medley of vegetables.  The key is to mix in the hot sauce and quickly mix everything together while the bowl still sizzles.  This was a major disappointment because there was just SO MUCH rice and so little veggies and the veggies that they did use were very uninspired.  They could have used some traditional korean greens but instead it was just the plain stuff...  I can easily make it better at home.\n\nAlso, the banchan was bad as well.   The marinated garlic stems were horrible and tasted way old...  so did the kimchi..\n\nIt's not worth the drive but if I'm in the neighborhood maybe I'll try it again one day.

We were the 4th couple to be seated for breakfast after waiting in the sun for 20 mins. in the sun, while others came thru the back way and got service immediately. We ordered as soon as we could and waited 40 mins with promises ever 10 mins that our food would arrive soon...that never happened.  Everyone around us was having a grand ol' time eating while we waited patiently until we finally got the message  and fled. The waiter had no remorse and just avoided us. Though we cannot prove that we were sabotaged by waiter and host, it sure looked suspicious. The manager was sweet and tried to be helpful, but just too late.

review_196416,restaurant,"A solid dinner choice for our first night in Sin City, nothing outrageously amazing but certainly nothing offensive. Other than the fact that the hostess attempted to not seat our party until all of us had arrived, despite the fact that one of our flights was delayed...at any rate, they finally sat us, and food commenced to be ordered.\n\nA few bottles of wine, two red, two white, none memorable. Cured meats with grilled greens to start, which was rather tasty.  I had the pasta with lamb and mint in a red sauce, and it was delicious. Minus another star for the waiters clearing half the table's plates before we were all done eating.\n\nAll in all, nothing special, but when 8 ladies leave satisfied, who can really complain?",2
review_20673,restaurant,"Pretty good chain pizza.  Service was good too once I got the waitresses attention.  I must say that there is nothing special about this particular restaurant/location.  I had a small side salad with vinagrette dressing.  Very tasty.  Followed by the \""Meateaters\"" pizza for one (10\"").  The pizza was really just average.  Nothing to write home about.

All the gals there are friendly and the service is good. In fact today when I mentioned to the owner's brother that I had not tried the apple cider (it was jalapeno for me today) he went and got me some to try - that's treating the customer right!,4

review_531387,restaurant,Not bad but not very good. Burgers are tough and flavorless. Coleslaw lacking dressing so it was also bland and dry.

review_378142,restaurant,"Oxtail soup, creme brulee, french onion soup are probably the only good selection at this buffet. Paid $50 for each person from Friday-Sunday for dinner.

If you want to try this buffet, I suggest you go on the weekdays for lunch, it only costs $15 maximum.",2

review_40441,restaurant,"Like everyone else on Yelp, I've driven by this place about a million times without ever venturing inside; but when the 15yr old told me she really wanted some Mexican for dinner, unable to bring myself to go on yet another Filiberto's run, I logged onto Yelp, did a quick search and said to myself ... \""oh yeah, I've seen that place a gazillion times, why not?\""\n\nI read that the place has recently undergone a remodel.  If that's the case, I'd hate to see what it looked like before.  Other than a thick layer of schmutz on the ceiling, there was nothing wrong, but certainly nothing inside looked remotely new.  \n\nI walked up to the window and ordered the green chile burrito (my standard for all Mexican restaurants), my daughter ordered the machaca beef burrito and a quesadilla.  Actually, she ordered the pork carnitas burrito at first, but they were out, so machaca would have to do.\n\nThe food came up quickly, and while the tortillas were excellent, the green chile was average at best without the kick I expected.  The machaca burrito was absolutely packed with beef (had to have 3x the beef of the green chile burrito) and was pleasantly juicy.  The quesadilla comes simply folded in quarters.  Initially I thought it was just an extra tortilla, but sure enough, there was a layer of the standard melted cheddar inside.  Actually, it was kinda of fun to tear off pieces of the quesadilla and dip them in the red chile sauce they provide alongside.\n\nBonus points for having Barq's Red Creme Soda in the soda machine; otherwise nothing to get too excited about, but nothing noxious either.",2

review_131598,restaurant,"I enjoyed dining here, I asked for my steak medium rare and the chef cooked it with a nice ruby middle. I am glad that he cooked it the right way because so many people mistake brown meat for a well cooked steak. If that was the case, then there would not be a need to pay so much for steak. Everything was delicious and we were seated next to a nice couple and other than the seating being slightly close to the other tables (hibachis), it was a good time.",3

review_538088,restaurant,"Somehow everything in Ballantyne just isn't as good as other locations. Just like Brixx and Cantina, this MM is big and spacious with patio seating and the same menu as the Myers Park location but there's something about it that's just lacking in umph. And it's not the tacky MM hippy vibe features (this one has it to) but perhaps it's the staff - they seem like they're working and not hanging out like the staff at MMMP does. Maybe it's the boring surroundings. Or the pain in the ass parking. Whatever it is, I don't love this MM and I don't hate it, but it's basically Myers Park's lame big sister to me.",2
review_313774,restaurant,"Food:\n\""Hot Rocks\"" - Tasty.  I was a bit worried it'd just be plain sliced beef, and thus just a gimmick, but it was nicely seasoned with ponzu.  Don't cook it too long obviously, otherwise it'll be tough and chewy.\n\nCrispy rock shrimp - Pretty good.  Almost the same as Dynamite Shrimp at Sansei's, or other similar preparations of lightly tempura battered shrimp with a tiny kick.  \n\nTomahawk ribeye - Surprisingly really delicious.  I honestly  wasn't expecting much, but it was quite nicely salted (on the heavier side, which I prefer), with an excellent char (not too burnt, not too bland).  If I was a tad picky, or Tom Colicchio on Top Chef, I'd note the bone wasn't uber cleaned/Frenched, but still one of the better tasting steaks I've had.  \n\nUltimate Steak 80oz - only had a piece, which I found a bit on the bland side, as well as a tad chewy (though not from being overcooked).  \n\nSides (mushrooms, mac & cheese, broccolini) - on the smallish side, but given the size of the beef, sufficient for sharing with ~4 people.  Mac&cheese was a tad rich, though the crust was great.  \n\nAmbiance/service/etc:\nThe decor is dark and trendy, though there's only a partial wall separating out the main casino floor, which sort of detracts from the ambiance with all the flashing lights and hubub.  If seated further in, it helps a bit, but the seats closer to the casino wouldn't really feel particularly steak-housey.  Service was good.",3

review_45105,restaurant,"Macaroni Grill strikes me as the perfect \""Office Christmas Party\"" location. The food is average, or maybe slightly above average in a totally conventional way, but lacks the creativity that some of its non-corporate counterparts offer. \n\nService is actually the best thing here, in my opinion, but I get the feeling that the staff can't stand working there. I can't really back that up, and no one has ever said that to me explicitly, I just get that vibe. \n\nIt would be a good place to take small children or large groups. For birthdays, there is a staff singer (I think that's how it works, at least) who sings a Venetian serenade as if it were on a gondola. A little cheesy, I know, but some people are into that.",2
review_303310,restaurant,"Let me start by saying that I was pretty hungry when I stopped into Genghis Grill. The concept is similar to other locations in the valley with smaller portions than others I have visited. The staff was super friendly and very helpful but please.... the buffet where you load your food was filthy! Not just spilled food, but dirty bowls to heap your food into and crusty little sauce bowls too. I can't believe the health department hasn't taken a peek at that. The food was fair but I just couldn't get past the mess. Sorry.",0
review_548072,restaurant,"I came here on a whim with Don earlier today. When we were trying to go to another restaurant and found out Sunset doesn't connect to Valley View. We just entered the plaza and decided to eat at Cafe Berlin since neither of us has ever had German food before. When we entered the restaurant, there were absolutely no customers and there were three people at the counter talking to each other (waitress, possible owner, and another guy). The waitress quickly brought out menus for us and got our drink orders (coffee and Spezi. She was definitely German, she had a very heavy German accent and everything; it was pretty cool. \n\nI wouldn't say we really ordered authentic German dishes since I just got the daily special Gyspy Style Sausage w/ french fries ($6.50) and Don got The North German burger ($8.50) with a side of Spaetzle ($2.95), but they were still very good. My sausage really tasted homemade and had a lot of flavor and the french fries that came with it were cooked to perfection. Don's burger had beef chuck, garlic shrimp, tomato, lettuce, and coleslaw. The garlic shrimp were definitely an interesting, yet tasty, little add-on. \n\nWhile we were eating, the waitress came over and asked if we wanted refills, of course we said yes. However, I wish I hadn't because I ended up getting charged for every cup of regular coffee I got. I really bugs me when people charge per cup of REGULAR coffee. I would've gotten some other beverage, like Spezi, since that came bottomless. \n\nAside from the coffee ordeal, I enjoyed this place. The waitress was very attentive and the food was appetizing.",3

review_603536,restaurant,"One star for a pretty decent sandwich.  Unfortunately the sandwich was the only acceptable part of this visit. \n\nWe stopped in because they had a banner saying they were featured on Food Network. The bait worked on us, and we were hungry and just wanted to get to out hotel ASAP. How long could it take to get just ONE philly steak sandwich?! \n\nWe walk in to an incredibly tacky looking place, but what REALLY hit us was the smell. Not their fault, but they're sharing a wall with a hookah lounge and holy crap, this place stank SO BAD. Sweet, fruity tobacco hung in the air and we could barely breathe. We almost left before ordering because of the smell but we decided to order anyway.\n\nThere was an older couple working. The lady took our order and was friendly enough but they were out of bell peppers (um, so go buy some?!) and she literally wrote our order down on this piece of scrap paper (an old receipt?) and laid it next to the grill for the cook. Hmmm, we were beginning to wonder...\n\nWe ordered one Philly sandwich which is pretty much the only thing they have on the menu. We also got a bottle of water and our total was $13.something. Seems a bit steep but we had high hopes.\n\nThe order of ONE sandwich took over 20 minutes. The grill was clearly not hot because the food sat on it for ages while the cook worked at a snails pace to assemble ours and the people's who ordered 10 min after us. \n\nNothing on the grill sizzled and when we FINALLY got our sandwich nothing was caramelized or browned. Just gray. The cheese was laid in the bun and not melted on top on the grill. Weak. It tasted decent but was nowhere near worth the price or the wait!\n\nThe bathroom smelled of hookah and raw sewage and we were gagging at the smell of this place by the end of the meal.\n\nGood luck staying open if it takes you 20 minutes to make one sandwich, the only thing on your menu. Stay away from this dump.",0
review_18848,restaurant,"This may have been some of the best Italian take out I have had in the midtown/downtown Phoenix area in a long time. The husband and I picked up some delicious food here last night. We split a calzone with pepperoni and basil, a side of meatballs, and an order of garlic bread. Total? 18$...whaaaat?!?! Awesome! and it was a ton of food too. The meatballs were really good, soft, but not too soft, and flavorful. The garlic bread was nothing too special, but it was standard. The calzone was very good. They loaded this thing with basil, it wasn't like a little bit here and there, so I appreciated that. Additionally, it had a lot of pepperoni...too much for me, but the husband loved that. They top the calzone with garlic and bake until it's golden brown.... this thing was so delicious and large, we certainly had leftovers. I also found out that this place will deliver all the way out to my house at 15th ave and mcdowell....awesome! This may be my new go to pizza. \n\n\nPS this place is very accommodating, they have vegan and gluten free menus... awesome!",3
review_190202,restaurant,"I agree with Dave M. that the food here is pretty basic Chinese food that's overpriced.  The Wynn is 5 minutes from Chinatown, and you can find a dozen better places there.\n\nWhen my wife and I went there, they sat us at a table right next to a table where someone just threw up.  They had a cleaning crew there spraying an obnoxious disinfectant, which was quite unpleasant for the people nearby trying to eat.  They started cleaning before we got our meal, so we asked to get moved, which they did.  They apologized many times, but it was pretty tacky to try and sit people near a table where someone just threw up.",0
review_172357,restaurant,"I love Tom Colicchio and was so excited to come here....but I was not impressed. \n\nWe made reservations here for our last night in Vegas and we both just wanted a really nice, juicy steak. I first ordered the fresh mozzarella \""salad\"" - this wasn't a salad. It was fresh mozzarella topped with a tomato concoction. It was tasty but I was expecting more of a salad since it was listed under the salads. My boyfriend ordered the lobster bisque and was very happy with it because it had big chunks of lobster. \n\nFor our meals, we each ordered a 10oz filet, shitake mushrooms, asparagus, and au gratin potatoes. We were brought our food and both of our filets were room temperature..not hot at all. We don't like to make a scene and we were hungry so we sucked it up. Also, we both ordered our filets medium...the meat was pink on the inside and cooked on the outside, but they were not very tender and were actually pretty dry. The asparagus was asparagus, the shitakes were good, and the potatoes were alright. We didn't even bother with dessert.\n\nAll in all, it was a mediocre meal that we paid way too much for. I'd rather eat at Ruth's Chris anyday. Actually - the meal we ate at Wolfgang Puck in the MGM was about 10 times better than this meal. \n\nStep up your game, Tom Colicchio!!!",2
review_183625,restaurant,"Good eats! They have quite the extensive menu so it's sure to full-fill whatever you're craving for whether it be breakfast, lunch, steak or what not. I'm a fan of their tuna ahi salad. Hugh portions and really fresh sashimi. They weren't cheap on the servings of tuna either so that's probably why they charge you $17 for it! Well worth it though given the serving size and the quality of the fish and also it being Vegas. I wasn't feeling too good that day so having a bowl of their creamy chicken soup was comforting. It's interesting how they brought it out. They didn't just bring me out a bowl with the soup in it like you would normally get, instead they brought me an empty bowl and pour the soup into my bowl from a little metal flask that kept the soup piping hot when it was served to me. Nice touch! The place was pretty packed when we went and our server was always attentive.",3
review_206405,restaurant,"We had lunch here yesterday.  The service and food was great.  Very authentic Cantonese food.  I didn't expect a good dim sum restaurant inside a Las Vegas casino.  It is a gem despite its undignified name.  Apparently it is not a hidden gem either because there was a long line outside the restaurant before noon.  Don't empty your wallet while waiting in a field of slot machines, save some to pay for the lunch.  Its Chinese name is Jin Yuan Bao (lit. gold ingots) which is a much better name especially to those high rollers in Vegas.\n\nIt is actually much better than the dim sum restaurant in Las Vegas Chinatown on Spring Mountain Road.",4
review_285909,restaurant,"Best Chinese fast food food yet. I order the lunch specials daily and always found them to be delicious. I have tried curry beef and chicken, kung pao chicken. Recently discovered the Mongolian beef and now I really like that one, reminds me of Korean / teriyaki bbq. Good value for the money and fills you up. Low salt and no msg. The lunch specials are from 11-4 daily but I have called a little before or after and no problem still ordering. Odd though there is a large sign outside for 10% off for happy hour 1-3pm. When I ask the clerk about the discount he said they no longer have that. Guess they are more focused on food? Try to get the 10% off if you can!",4
review_347504,restaurant,"Salt, salt, salt, and more salt.\n\nHey...the meat there is pretty salty.  But it's good stuff.  They can be a little cheap on the premium meats like beef ribs - which are spectacular.  Instead, they'll bring around the parmesan chicken and such about 10 times as often.  Boo.  \n\nI have been there about 10 times and have to say it was better when I first went there.  Not sure if it was the \""novelty\"" or whether the quality has deteriorated.  The salad bar is still solid with a surprisingly high quality romaine lettuce.  But you really go for the meat and last time I went they only had about 5-6 kinds of meat to bring around.  For $50/person that is not gonna cut it Texas de Brazil.  \n\nSides they bring to your table also are not great.  The cheese bread has been sitting under a heat lamp for too long.  Again, for $50/person you can afford to bake those throughout the night.  What else if your kitchen doing?",2
review_280636,restaurant,"Only had pizza and wings. \n\nThey were not busy at all.\nWings looked and tasted like they had been cooked a long time before. Slimy. Ate two wings. Tossed the rest.

Skimpy on the sauce too.\n\nThe pizza was NOT what I expected...just OK. The cheese was good, but that is the only thing about that was. \nSauce, first off, should not have been on the pizza. It was a Margherita pizza. \nFirst place EVER that I had tomato sauce on a Margherita pizza. Their menu did not specify, so I assumed it was traditional. To top it off, it was VERY salty. \n\nThe crust was not cooked all the way through and the toppings were scant. (Except the cheese). Minimal amount of fresh basil. so little that I could barely taste it.\n\nI'll try again and update the review if I have a better experience (Going to go when it is busy to increase the chances of \""fresh\"")\n\nBut at the price I paid, I expected FAR better that what I got!",1
review_341615,restaurant,"I was very pleased with being greeted by smiling faces versus the automatic one liner most places teach their staff.

That's what happened :(\n\nI went with the Elk burger with The Works (grilled mushrooms, American cheese, and bacon), wedge fries, and a drink for $15! I thought, 'ok. fine. it better be good!' Hey! I'm not cheap-- we're in an economic crisis! Haha! I get a buzzer to let me know my burger is ready (awesome so you don't have to wonder or miss hearing your name!) and when I get the burger, my high expectations aren't met. I guess I assumed the elk burger would have more of a game-y flavor but I was wrong. I probably should've went with a regular beef burger.\n\nDefinitely a very cool environment!

I got their crab and shrimp seafood salad sandwich but the only complaint I have about it is that it was WAYY too salty. It was too salty to the point that I had to dig into the bread they gave us in the beginning just to finish the salad. On a more positive note, my bf got their classic steak dish and that wasn't a disappointment at all.\n\nI would definitely come here again to try something different on their menu.

review_393257,restaurant,"Randomly ate here yesterday as my wife had a meeting down in Town Square. Ordered an Emma (turkey, bacon, swiss, sprouts, honey mustard) on wheat. Lots of bread, sprouts. Weak portion of turkey. Honey mustard was overpoweringly sweet. Johnny McGuire's is banking on the Blue Martini and Cadillac Ranch crowd. \""I'm too drunk to go down this escalator! Ooh let's get a sandwich baby!\""\n\nI'm surprised that the LV location didn't grill my Emma's turkey, bacon and swiss together like they usually do at the Aspen location. I wonder if the Nevada health code is tougher than Colorado's because Johnny McGuire's in Aspen does a lot of raw steak action on the grill combined with putting whole sandwiches on the grill, then grills turkey, then some more raw steak, then grills bread, and so on, all with the same spatula. \n\nNOT surprised that the guy and girl working behind the counter in LV were both on the rude side. When I didn't order chips, fries or a drink with my sandwich the guy looked at me like a vending machine that got his Snickers bar stuck. With the tone of \""I've told you 10 times before, and I won't tell you again!\"" he told me to pick up my sandwich on the other side of the counter. Roger that, buttface! Also not surprised that other Yelpers have been experiencing the same Johnny's bad attitude. \n\nHaving been an Aspen local for 7 years and an unofficial local (summers only) for 4 years before that, I have had my share of the Aspen Johnny McGuire's experience. Eating at Johnny's in Aspen is pretty good and safe at breakfast, but because of the same-spatula phenomenon that happens there, any other meal is a 5 to 1 crapshoot. I can't count on all of my fingers and toes how many times friends and acquaintances who ate a Johnny's sandwich complained of a twisting knot in their belly and either threw up or had the runs for the rest of the night. Truth is that all of that random grilling madness makes their sandwich taste great (and greasy) but it takes about 2 or 3 twisting knot episodes to learn to tread lightly (go for breakfast or when it's not busy for less cross-contamination).\n\nThe staff at Johnny's in Aspen usually consists of a hard-working and energetic (usually Hispanic) spatula master and one or two other 'hater' 20-something snowboarder/skater types (the kind who get mad at you if their girlfriend checks you out). Johnny's has historically attracted a rude audience - four long-time 20-something customers were convicted of multiple armed robberies and grand theft of a Range Rover a few years ago. They ate at Johnny's almost every day.\n\nBottom line: The LV location doesn't taste as good as the Aspen one. Same ingredients, same skimpy meat portions, even the same weird big-ass cookies. Wondering if the LV staff was trained to prepare for the same punk-ass clientele that the Aspen location attracts. If so, Johnny has it wrong. The LV location should try to be nice - from what I saw their customers are half LV locals and half tourists. Men and women can actually walk into the Las Vegas Johnny McGuire's without getting tripped by a skateboard, hit on, or spat on! \n\nJohnny McGuire's makes Subway look like Capriotti's.",1

All of their speciality rolls have spicy tuna in them.. Because again they're cheap. The saki bombs all come out in plastic cups... Again because they're cheap.

There's not much to brag about the scene. With zero street visibility, no proximity to night life/culture and hidden in an half-empty strip mall, the restaurant must rely on its great  food to sustain business.

Unfortunately, if things don't change at this location, it will be another short tenure.\n\nA plus to start with:  they have a great Antipasta/cured meat plate...really enjoyed it.\n\nMy wife had the Chicken Diablo which she was really happy with but my son's Chicken Marsala was bland and tasteless.\n\nFurther, how do you mess up a center cut filet mignon?  Well, let me answer you...first, you send out the steak overcooked.  Then, you make sure the \""blue cheese crust\"" is able to be scraped off with your knife and set it a little pile on the side of the plate.  Lastly, I'm not sure this was even a filet...it was thin and looked like a New York Strip that had been trimmed to look like a filet.\n\nLastly, service was poor.  Waitress was very nice, but often was not around. I'm assuming there was another dining room perhaps?  In any event, in our dining room there were approximately 5-7 tables being served and after an uncomfortably long wait for our entrees, we were told that the kitchen had lost the ticket.  Really?  To their credit, they sent out a small serving of their pasta and it was the best think I ate all night.   \n\nI hope they shake out all the issues because it would be nice to have a stable restaurant in this location.",1
review_167913,restaurant,"Made reservations here on a busy friday night and was seated right away at arrival. The service was good, the view of the bellagio fountains even better, and the food fantastic. The hanger streak was moist and tender and the scallops juicy and plump! We were so suprised to get such excellent quality for such a decent price. The creme brulee was really nice and creamy too but wasn't too sweet. Bf and I both agreed that Mon Ami Gabi was the best meal we had at vegas during our most recent trip and we'd gladly go back !",4
review_628061,restaurant,"Slow service, the server gave us a dirty high chairs, it has lots of crumbs on it.\nDidn't try the pizza, I just ordered the Parmesan pretzels , they're pretty good !!\nWe will try the pizza next time.\nWish the server was more attentive and please clean the high chairs before and after  each use!",1
review_624688,restaurant,"I've eaten in twice, today first time for take out. First rule, eat in... you easily get two or three times the amount of food for the same price. Next, check your order. I'm vegan and I always modify. My take out had meat in it. When I called back to ask nicely to remake my order, the guy argued with me and said \""the cook said he didn't put meat in it.\""  Trust me, I would be eating it if it didn't have meat in it. The food seems fresh, and like I said, if you eat in there's plenty for leftovers. Team Noodle, my real suggestion is to add a vegan pasta to the menu so there's no confusion or arguing with the \""cook\"" about what should be on the dish. Keep it simple and everyone will be happy.",1
review_479520,restaurant,"I'm with NP, this place is average at best and I am surprised by the rave reviews as well - so I'm giving it a Meh 2 star review.\n\nAs we just moved to another south Charlotte area, we decided to get on the hunt for a Chinese restaurant.  As close as this one is across the border, sadly this will not be the one. \n\nI typically order sesame chicken when I go to Chinese restaurants and it was no different here.  While the presentation is A+, the taste was not as flavorful as other restaurants we have gone to.  I was also disappointed that they put the broccoli on the side instead of letting it soak up the sauce and other flavors, so instead you get bland steamed broccoli.  The sauce was also very thick around the chicken, so there was nothing extra to pour ontop of the rice or let the rice soak up the sauce either.\n\nI am not sure what Kevin ordered, some chicken dish.  Now the veggies in here were nice as they soaked up the sauce and flavor very well.  I think the only complaint is when Kevin has typically ordered this dish elsewhere, it is mild, and here it was very spicy.\n\nNice little quiet restaurant, but we will try somewhere else.",1
review_511262,restaurant,"My wife and I had been previously, and it was quite good. that was a couple of months ago. Today was a much different story. We came in for Sunday mid-morning breakfast. The wait as interminable. Finally, after taking our order, the server came back about 10 minutes later exclaiming, \""I'm brain dead, what did you order?\"" This wasn't a 7 course gourmet fine dining meal. This was an omelet. Duh....1/2 hour later the food arrived on a 4\"" saucer plate. A tad small. The home fries were rancid and cold. After sending them back, 15 minutes later, the fries came. Hot, but Greasy. Needless to say, we're not going back.",1
review_243099,restaurant,I tried this place out the first time yesterday - i ordered the chicken enchilada combo with red sauce to go. It was pretty good- I think I will try the steak tacos next time -they look delicious on the sign. I was a little disappointed that they had all of sides in metal containers in the front.. But the rice was fresh so it was ok. Will try them again in the future.,2
review_79748,restaurant,"My lunch here was very tasty, I had a bacon apple salad which was huge and some iced tea that hit the spot.  I'd give it a three and a half if I could because service was awesome, the food was good, but it just made me uncomfortable to be in there... probably because the atmosphere really wasn't my style.  The decorations were sort of Victorian and floral and it was all women having lunch - save one older gentleman out with his wife.  Anyway, the first thing I thought when I walked in was that this place would make my boyfriend cringe!  But, I will definitely take my mom here when she comes into town and would recommend it to people looking for that sort of warm, quiet, feminine atmosphere.",2
review_605713,restaurant,"so this has always been one of my favorite places to eat chicken and it seems that lately every time i go it just gets worse and worse, but i was here two nights ago and i came threw drive thru with my sister and we each got our normal box combo. so we were excited to bring it home and dig in:) but once we stared eating it something was just not right, the fries tasted old and the chicken tasted totally different almost as if our food was reheated or food from earlier that wasn't sold earlier and given to us, it didn't taste fresh at all, and we live close so its not like it was a long drive, this is the third time in a row i have not been satisfied there, i don't think we will be back in a while, or maybe just try another location.",2
review_65177,restaurant,Nice Hibachi style and sushi restaurant. Food tasted great and the table chef was very entertaining. Price was OK and the place was full on a weekday. Lots of birthdays that evening. Atmosphere not that great and the neighborhood is changing.,3

review_513737,restaurant,"I'm sorry but this is the worst Thai  food I have eaten in 10 years. Living in Los Angeles, you get a chance to try all sorts of thai food, from the authentic to the 'americanized' versions.\n\nEven the review that is posted on the wall in the restaurant says at the bottom \""nothing really great\"". The small portions are a direct relation to the reason the prices are low. It's like ordering kiddie meals.\n\nThe reason they even get one star is because the owner is very friendly, but she needs to know that her brother cannot cook and he needs to find another gig. \n\nI ordered the Penang curry and spring rolls to go. The rice paper of the spring rolls was not closed correctly and it came apart as I was picking it up (see photo). The Penang was tasteless and watery. all the four small bite sized chicken pieces were bland and felt like they were thrown in there at the very end.\n\nI cannot fathom how people can give this restaurant anything more than a 1 star. I know the owner is nice, but this is a restaurant, and quality of food is what i'm rating.",0
review_39300,restaurant,"I decided to try Wonderful Wanda's after Keegan's redid their breakfast menu and changed it for the worse. My first impression was that the dining room was extremely small and crowded. I then faced an even more unpleasant surprise when I had to go to the bathroom and realized that I would have to walk through the middle of the kitchen to get to it. The bathroom was about the size of a closet and pretty dirty. The service and the food did not do anything to improve my opinion of the restaurant. The service was slow and disorganized-- I watched my food sit on the counter for a good five minutes before the waitress brought it over, and when she finally did, it was barely warm anymore. The food itself was pretty mediocre. I will not be back again.",0
review_177846,restaurant,"I use to love this buffet but after my last visit I wasn't that impressed. Crab legs were thin, prime rib was dry, desserts were bland and fell apart. Who knows, an off night maybe? I still like the place but it has dropped to my top 5 Vegas buffets, instead of top 3. Step-up your game Bellagio buffet!",2
review_401514,restaurant,"Hurray!  Good food at reasonable prices in a comfortable atmosphere.  The Moules et Frites (with the butter & white wine sauce, NOT the chorizo) are a must.  The crab cake will either be a) the best in town or b) a mushy mayo mess.  Likewise, the steak can really vary in cut and quality.  However, we keep coming back for the great house chardonnay, warm service, and mussels.",3
review_516273,restaurant,"The pizza is ok, not great. It is also a bit over priced. However, customer service is pretty bad. The young girl that took my order was impolite and acting as she was making me a favor. Anyway, try it out, not bad but be cautions of people working there.",1
review_136055,restaurant,"We were here for my 30th birthday last month.  I've heard a lot of good things about this place so I wanted to try it.  We usually pick Lawry's as our special dinner; but figured to give it a try.  \n\nWell, it was not how I had really envisioned it.  I guessed I assumed it would be more intimate?  I was wrong.  We were seated at one of the middle tables in one of the rooms.  When we first sat down (reservations was t 7pm); it was quiet.  But, Boy...when it hit 8pm it was like a party.  So much people crammed in one room, conversations and music.  It was just too much for me.  \n\nBut, the food was great.  They had this special for 2 people for $99 which included a salad, entree, 2 sides and dessert.  My filet mignon was cooked perfectly and we also had it oscar-style (stuffed crab) and it was filled w/ crab.  It was delicious!\n\nIf we were to go back; we may bring friends who want to grab dinner and drinks.  I wouldn't go back for a romantic dinner, though.",3
review_59517,restaurant,"We have been coming to this location since 2003. It was my first experience with Chicago style pizza. The pizza was really good and the service okay back then. It closed a coupe times in 2010, for unknown reasons. It re-opened and new management took over in '11. Now, the service and food quality has gone downhill ever since. I remember when we went in after new management took over, they manager told us \""Yeah, I'm gonna make it better than it used to be.\"" Not even close! It seems the delivery & bar orders take precedence over dining room orders. We never see the same server twice, ever. The dining room table configuration is too crowded now. Our server kept telling us \""Your pizza is coming out right now...\"" Right now came over an hour later for 2 pizzas. The drink refill service was poor at best. Our server asked half the table if they wanted refills, and didn't ask the other side. They gave us free desert to make up for all of it, but it didn't matter. I don't think we will be going back here much any more.",1
review_552170,restaurant,"So much has changed since I first discovered Mini Pot. Qi (the owner) has added a lot more variety to the menu. There are a few additional pots and a ton of new sides. \n\nThere's a selection of grilled skewers--all of which are excellent! The dry spice rub has a cumin base and is incredibly flavorful. Although spice level is objective, I think people of all heat tolerances can handle it. The chicken wings and little sausages are my favorites. But if you're craving something meatier, they've got lamb and beef skewers too.\n\nThe new jelly noodle dish is mouth-wateringly addictive... and its cold! It's a pretty hefty serving, so I suggest sharing it with another person or simply ordering it alone with some skewers. It's a wet noodle dish with a somewhat soupy sauce. It's refreshing, spicy, and has a hint of that nutty Chinese sesame paste. Fore-warning: The heat from the chili pepper will creep on you!\n\nA few new mini pots have hit the menu! Kimchi, I believe, is the most recent. I haven't tried it yet but I'm sure it will be a hit. I might be Korean but my frequent orders will probably remain the lamb pot, the tendon & radish pot w/ a side of tofu skins and rice ovalettes. The menu is still finding its footing. So what does or does not come with the pot varies visit to visit. For now, mini pots are sold on their own where noodles and/or rice are sold separately. \n\nDon't forget to pick up your frequent diner stamp card. Buy 10 get 1 free. I've filled up 2 cards already and working on my third.",4

review_621232,restaurant,"There's no shortage of good burger places in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area so it's a tough space to operate in.  The food was pretty good but the atmosphere of this place is tragic and totally counter to the concept of a speakeasy or mob themed burger place.  First, it's very bright and many of the spotlights are poorly aimed.  Second, the place feels like they ran out of money or were on a tight budget as it's very spartan and also very quiet, no music or ambiance at all.  Finally, the service was mediocre, slow, and generally blah as the staff showed little hustle or enthusiasm for their jobs.  \n\nVery bummed out, was hoping this place would be a cool, dark, and delicious new spot to add to the rotation.  Oh well, back to Zin Burger or Rehab Burger, or Delux, or Stax, etc, etc, etc.",1
review_422939,restaurant,"Recently stopped here for breakfast on the way out of town.  The breakfast sandwiches were delicious.  Lots of egg, cheese, turkey.  The bread was so fresh.

review_603856,restaurant,"Yes, this place serves good food.  \n\nWe had the pork and the beef sandwiches, with a side of great beans and the veggie of the day.   We liked everything.  One thing I liked is the serving size of the sandwiches and sides are not so huge as a lot of BBQ places.  We got full, but didn't get overly stuffed trying to eat very large portions.  And the price is a little cheaper than the places that serve too much food. \n\nMy one recommendation would be to serve fresh brewed ice tea, that's nice and clear, with a slice of lemon.\n\nThe owners, Kenny and his wife are friendly, nice people.  Kenny and I had several interesting conversations about barbecue, and how he likes to make it.\n\nWe will go back.",3
review_77936,restaurant,"It's truly never a good sign when the best service you receive comes from the valet. I wish I was joking.\nWe have been a few times for brunch and it is normally fantastic. We decided to go for restaurant week summer 2014 based on the menu. We arrived at 7 for our reservation at 7:15 and were seated by a window for a beautiful view of the city. The host was very friendly and informed us that our server Colleen would be with us shortly.\nColleen arrived and took our drink orders. Awhile later she returned with our drinks and to take our orders. Now, I'm not sure if she thought her check average would be low because we ordered the restaurant week specials or what, but everything went downhill from here.\nOur salads arrived and Chris and I both finished our drinks before our salads. Colleen did not return to ask if we would like another drink for at least 25 minutes. We sat with empty glasses and cleaned plates for a long time. Now, there were two other tables in front of us that she was waiting on. She would come out, check on the couple who was celebrating their anniversary, and then return to the kitchen. Then come back, drop off what they needed and then go back to the kitchen. Then come out, check on the table directly in front of ours, and return to the kitchen. Come out, deliver what they needed, and back to the kitchen. I kept trying to catch her eye but would have had to dance on the table to be noticed I think. She finally returned to clear plates and ask if we needed other drinks, which we did.\nOur meals were delivered by a manager, I can only imagine they had been under the heat lamp forever before someone got fed up enough to deliver them. I had the salmon, Chris had the shrimp fresco, and my mother had the short ribs. They really enjoyed their meals. My salmon was dried out from being under the heat lamps for too long and the sauce was very sweet. I only finished half of it and again we sat for the longest time with no acknowledgment or plate clearing whatsoever!\nColleen finally returned and cleared our plates. Dessert was finally delivered and the chocolate mousse and the bananas foster creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e were very good. Again we finished and sat with empty plates for forever.\nI finally ventured to the restroom to discover the Colleen was too busy flirting with a bartender at a table behind the grand piano and laughing and hair tossing with another server and what I can only assume was a manager based on her street clothes. I went to the restroom and returned and she was still there. \nI got back to our table and five minutes later she decided to return to ask if we were ready for our check. All in all our dinner of three courses took an hour and 45 minutes. Now I'm all for taking my time for dinner, so long as someone will stop by to refill Chris's water glass and bring more wine or cocktails. But if you intend to ignore us and decrease your check average, then you can also expect to get a subpar tip. Sadly the food was good with the exception of the salmon, and I'm sure the chef didn't intend for it to sit under a heat lamp forever. \nAll in all, Chris had said we will not return, even for brunch. It's sad because it is a gorgeous setting and the food is actually good but the service was so disappointing that I doubt we will return.\nA sidenote, when we went to pick up my car from the valet he RAN to get our car. Seriously RAN. And opened my door for me. He received a 100% tip for being the best service we had that night.",1
review_455447,restaurant,"After Earl and I volunteered at Three Square, we were hungry.  Since we are barely in the North side of town, we decided to try out an eatery that we cannot visit often in Henderson.  We decided on 808 Hawaii Mixed Plate.\n\nWhen we arrived, there was a group of guys in front of us.  Their orders came out and majority got the garlic chicken.  In addition, the portion looked huge.  Earl and I decided on the 2 meat combo.  We got the Kahlua pork and cabbage, as well as the garlic chicken.  It came with a scoop of rice and choice of mac salad or green salad.  We opted for the green salad.  The food came out after 10 minutes.  The Kahlua pork and cabbage was very tasty.  Just the right about of seasoning.  The garlic chicken was super flavorful.  It was crispy, sweet, and a bit spicy.  The mayo aioli was a great addition to this chicken.  The green salad had some brown, due to the old lettuce.  Was not very fresh.\n\nOverall, the food was good and cheap.  One plate was more than enough for both Earl and I.  We will visit when we are back to volunteering at Three Square.",3

review_185492,restaurant,"Mmmmm, this has been on my \""To Try\"" for Las Vegas for several months now and we were finally able to make it there over the weekend.  Located in Treasure Island, it was easy to find. \n\nThe ONLY glitch in everything was the fact that we made a reservation at 8:00pm, and arrived at 7:45pm.  The hostess told us they were really busy and we needed to come back at 8pm.  It was said so awkwardly that we didn't feel welcome in the EMPTY bar area, so we went out into the casino again.  Hmph.\n\nBack to 8:00pm.  We were seated and given the absolutely yummy chips and salsa, definitely plus 2 points for presentation.  Then we asked about a tequila flight and the server suggested one to us, plus 2 more points for it not being the most expensive!   We chose the organic margarita as well.\n\nThe tequila flight was pretty good and a fun experience.  We ended up pouring one into our margaritas.  Our meal was delicious.  I went with my usual black bean burrito and they nailed it (although, how hard, right?) and my husband went with the carne asada tacos. \n\nBoth of us left drunk and satisfied!",4

review_140140,restaurant,"$9.99 AYCE PASTA at least that's what it was a few months ago. A few extra dollars and you can add chicken or other meats.

They have a pretty awesome Happy Hour of 50% off almost everything from cocktails, bears, food and hookahs which run from 5pm-7pm everyday.  Tuesdays there have a different Happy Hour but run longer 5pm-1am (Best night).\n\nThey have a large hookah area separate from their large dinning area, always good.  Great service.

review_282868,restaurant,"My brother and I stopped here in the half an hour interim between his soccer practice and my school's musical. I had heard good things, but was a little wary about it. I was wrong to have avoided it!\nWe walked in, and the menu was large and obvious right in front of us. My brother looked and looked for something he wanted, and finally settled on an option, but had originally had his heart set on a breakfast burrito. We got up to the register (no line, yay!) and I saw that they had breakfast burritos, but was unsure if they were still offering them at 6:30 PM. My brother asked (and he is very shy about asking people things, so he speaks quietly and a bit unsteadily) and the woman behind the register was incredibly patient and kind. \nHe got his breakfast burrito (eggs and bacon and nothing else in a tortilla, and he absolutely loved it) and I got a BLT burrito (which sounds odd, but is fantastic. Bacon, lettuce, tomatoes, and mayo) and everything was great.\nTheir seating area was cute, and had the patio not been under reconstruction, it would have been perfect to sit outside.\nGo to the Original Burrito Company, because the food is amazing and the staff are sweet. Hands down some of the best Mexican food I've had!",3
review_477068,restaurant,"Excellent! Great improvements since it opened last year. We went on a Thursday night. We made reservations for the upstairs dining room as we don't enjoy the backless stools at the community dining area below. \n\nWe ordered the snails, pork rillette, beef tartare, hanger steak with kimchi and the lamb shank. \n\nAll of the portion sizes were much larger than I remember them to be last year when they opened. Also the prices seemed to have dropped a bit too. \n\nThe food was delicious. I would definitely return again soon. \n\nThe kimchi was outstanding with the hanger steak. The lamb shank could have used more spice or flavor. \n\nOur servers were a little cold and distracted. I actually heard the girl say, as I was walking to the bathroom after she took my order, that she was \""just going to put our whole fucking order in.\"" I assume instead of putting in the starters first. Regardless it was a nice experience.",3
review_497528,restaurant,"I had heard about this place before, but hadn't had the chance to go. It's the kind of place that it's easy to miss unless you're looking for it. I dropped in for some late night noms the other night though, and was very pleased. \n\nI wasn't very hungry so I just got fried mushrooms, expecting the little button mushrooms you usually get. Boy was I surprised when these giant slices of fried goodness appeared before me! They went awesome with the horseradish sauce that came with it, a nice change from the typical ranch. My friend got a burger and it looked incredible. I can't wait to find myself hungry in NoDa again.",3
review_192047,restaurant,"I went to the coffee shop at TI today.  It sits next to the Pho place, they are basically the same place with a different host desk.  Same table areas and I'm sure the food comes out of the same kitchen.  My husband and I entered through the coffee shop entrance and even though they were semi-busy it was still a wait to get a table.  There were at least half a dozen empty tables waiting to be cleared.  The hostess looked upset and kept coming to apologize for our wait, as a huge line began to form behind us.  I mean show some initiative and grab a bucket instead of freaking out about it.  \n\nWe were seated at a table next to the service entrance which was annoying, but at least our waitress couldn't duck and hide.  I asked if we could order off the Pho menu.  I only wanted some spring rolls, no weird shaped spoons, tiny bowls or fancy condiments required.  I was told they could not accommodate my request.  We both ordered \""The biggest burger on the strip\"" which I'm sure it's not.  Ten ounces the menu claims, I doubt it, but whatever it was edible.  \n\nThe bill came with our order, no upsales there.  I did order a soda when my meal came and it must have been too much of a choir to re-do the bill, so I got my beverage for free.  Not once were we checked on during our lunch, but we got a re-fill when the waitress brought back the reciept to sign.  Not that we really needed it, we were done.  Not bad if your staying at the hotel I suppose, a bit over-priced.  Just remember if you want pho or any asian food you better damn well enter at the pho side or your sh*t outta luck.",1
review_142400,restaurant,"While my first visit to Paymon's was awesome, my second time around wasn't so hot. Service or the lack thereof ruined the day. I was looking forward to the Athens fries again...but when they arrived on my table as an afterthought and only when I brought up their absence to the server when I finally caught her attention...and they arrived lukewarm at that...yeah...I'm not happy about that at all. \n\nI'm a spice junkie and Paymon's is a place that can give me the spice fix I crave. But when you're paying as much as they charge...it's not too much to ask to get hot food in a timely manner, and not have to wait forever to get your check. \n\n3 Stars...I hope your experience is better than mine was.",2
review_400298,restaurant,"If you are reading this today is your lucky day! Truly. I am an on again off again food snob. Maybe reformed. But no.\n I LOVE fried chicken! Always on the hunt for the tender fried feathered...unfeathered friend. I have chowed here 4 times expecting it to be orgasmic, wanting to love it. Well, I don't. I have finally decided to post why. I am not from the school of \""one and done\"" everybody, well almost everybody when it comes to food get's a second chance. Sometimes even more. I am done with Lo-Lo's however. Here is the phat skinny. I order the KK's. It is 3 pieces of chicken with two waffles, grits and cheesy onion eggs. I have a big ASS Kool-Aid, (wish they had the purple stuff) and I eat the whole damn meal. The waffles are ok for me, they are not as crisp on the outside as I would like and they are soooo thin. The cheese and onion eggs are great. But c'mon, the fried chicken at a fried chicken joint needs to be OUT OF THIS WORLD!!! With all fellow yelpers basically saying that it is I feel like I'm going to be sent off Yelp Island. Fortunately my little sis is a part of Yelp so I may get a free pass...ala second chance! The Fried Chicken here tastes like someone broke out some progresso bread crumbs and a big ass bottle of wesson cooking oil and cooked about 100 batches in the same dirty oil. It just had the burnt dirty oil flavor every time. I am not a fan of that. The Thighs were pretty descent, the breast was horrible. Every time the breast meat is dry, bland and has that off putting oil taste. \n So, LO-LO....NO-NO, get some Purple Drink-Mix and keep that damn bird moist. Change the oil more often and I will try again. Untill then I will keep creating my own \""Ghetto Taco\"" Thats what we call them in New York. A box of Churches a bottle of hot sauce and a box of frozen waffles..... with some Cream of Wheat on the side!!",1
review_104803,restaurant,"Still a fan, but maybe not as much since my last visit.  Rather than ordering the Italian staples of pasta, chicken or pizza, I had the scallops scampi.  Scallops were a little overcooked and the sauce was just not right IMO.  The husband had rack of lamb.  He was not impressed either.  It was smothered in mushrooms-CANNED mushrooms.  I didn't believe until I tasted for myself.    If they were not from a can, then the Green Giant works in the kitchen.  Major points off with me.  Service could have been better as well.\n\nWe did try the smoked salmon bruschetta and thought it was very good.  We'll just stick with the basics next time.  Still four stars with pasta and pizza for me.",2

review_83280,restaurant,This is one of my favorite outings when I don't have a little one with me.  I love the seafood bisque.  The pasta purses are divine!  I always sub out shrimp for the chicken!  The desserts are yummy.  It's just such fun to go out and be pampered at a meal and that is exactly what you get here!,4
review_390295,restaurant,"It is sort of funny, the day we were supposed to leave for Montreal, the weird foods guy on the travel channel went here.  So I quickly found out how to find it and get there.  It was worth the trip.  But I'm also amused by why there isn't a line out the door!  It was on TV just a couple of days before we were there and it has great things.  \n\nAfter recovering from our confusion on how to order and pay (go to the counter with the nice ladies at it first) we decided to try the mixed plate.  Three kinds of grilled goodies, roasted veggies, onion and parsley salad, tomatoes, salty pickles, hummus and pita.  At about $14 for 1/2 kilo it is a good amount for two hungary tourists.  Although, when we ordered the woman ringing up our order thought we wanted 1 1/2 kilos and not 1/2 kilo.  When she asked for $44 I probably was a little pale but we soon worked it out.  We also got some tabule and drinks and made it out of there with a bunch of food.  Just a counter to east at, but across the street and down a bit was a great park to try out the grilled bits.\n\nThe kafka kebabs were very nice.  Not dried out like they often are, but could have used something.  The steak Kebab were excellent.  I would have either again.  The chicken, dried out but it is rare to get some that are not, the seasoning on them were good, but these just weren't up to the level the other two were.  The rest of the items were all very good, flavorful and yummy.  I wish I cold have tried other things and the butcher section looked amazing.  Another trip then.\n\nWe took the metro out to the last top and waked to Abu Elias and then found a bus back.  Worth a trip out and when public transit works to get there, what is stoping you?",3

review_173252,restaurant,"I thought the food was very good when we ate there a year or so ago.  We went with a larger group (about 10) and had excellent service.  We had reservations, of course.  Everybody was pleased.  There are many reviews so there isn't much I can add.  We were staying at the Wynn, so it was easy to get there.",3
review_616295,restaurant,"This was a favorite of our years ago. Now that we are back in the neighborhood this will be a favorite again.

And they deliver!!",3
review_273814,restaurant,"I don't know why there seems to be so much hate for this place. From how it was explained to me, Primanti Bros. isn't necessarily famous for the quality of the food, but rather for it's culinary place/purpose in the history of Pittsburgh. I know it's probably hard to separate one's own experience from expectations raised from the Food Network hype, but this place is, and always will be, just a place that serves over the top, greasy, heart attack inducing grill food.  If you're coming here because you saw this place on a list, you're probably going to be disappointed.  \n\nSeeing the grill, the shabbiness of the establishment, and reading over the menu helped to manage my expectations pretty quickly.  It's a greasy spoon restaurant, plain and simple.  Thankfully I have a soft spot (probably several soft spots with the amount of times I visit places like this) for grilled and fried monstrosities.  I think a mistake that people probably make is reading on the menu that the 'Pitts-burger' is the #2 seller (after #1, beer), and subsequently ordering it with the thought that #2 ='s 'best thing on menu'. This is probably a HUGE mistake Primanti Bros. makes by advertising it.  Our waitress, who was certainly an incredibly friendly oversharer (read:  brutally honest) said that she didn't really care for the Pitts-burger compared to other burgers around the city that she's eaten, despite it's popularity.  She actually gave us her top 3 menu recommendations, and we ordered those instead.  I ate the pastrami and cheese sandwich, which I thought was very tasty.  I had never had fries and coleslaw IN a sandwich, and the flavor was different than what I was expecting. I washed it down with a Dogfish Head 60 Minute IPA, which I was happy to see they had on tap.  The prices for everything were all very reasonable for a 'tourist trap'.\n\nDo I think this is the best food I've ever eaten?  Not even close.  But I do think it's near the top of the pecking order for greasy spoon dives.",4
review_638817,restaurant,Food was bland.  Previous yelper said it tasted like buffet food and it did.  Good lunch prices but rather spend more for better food. Restaurant was nice and staff was friendly.,1
review_551225,restaurant,"Well... it was okay. I definitely had higher expectations for this place, but I'm not exactly sure why. Wahoo's is super cute, very clean and everyone was extremely friendly. I enjoyed the surf/skate motif and found it really visually appealing. I wasn't quite sure what to order, but I ended up with a shrimp soft taco and a Cajun grilled fish enchillada. It totaled just under $7. You basically place your order at the bar and then they give you a number placard and they'll bring it out to you. Self seating. \n\nThe restaurant was pretty empty, but it did seem to take awhile for the food to finally come out. It was good, very spicy and flavorful, but not very filling at all. The taco had a LOT of cabbage on it and was really small and difficult to pick up. I gave up trying and just ate it with a knife and fork. The enchillada was pretty good, but again on the small side.\n\nI guess Wahoo's is fine if you are craving Mexican and seafood in a nice atmosphere, but I just felt a little let down. I think I could have had a more satisfying meal elsewhere for the same amount.",2

review_648740,restaurant,"If i could give this place negative stars I would.  We have been going to Taharu for years at the Tempe location and never had issues. Apperantly this must be the red headed step child because the service is bad... Walked in when it was dead at 2 pm it's 314 pm and still don't have my order that I placed. I flagged down the server to have her tell me she doesn't know what happened to my order but if I want I can pull from the bar I could do so. The whole point of using the order form was because what I wanted wasn't on the bar.  No refills on drinks even after asking,  Horrible service. If I come back it will be the Tempe location since they don't leave you hanging for an hour and then loose your order.",0
review_493646,restaurant,"Review:  20 Veg Fried Rice / Red Braised Pork Street Sandwich\n\nWe specifically went to this restaurant to try the 20 Veg Fried Rice ($17.88) that was featured on Foodnetwork's \""Best Thing I Ever Ate.\""  LOVED it!  I wish I could duplicate the sauce.  Big bowl, definitely feeds 2 as a main dish, 3-4 as a side.  My husband had the Red Braised Pork Street Sandwich ($8) and he said it was very good.  Pricey though for a very small sandwich.  Still, the quality is outstanding and I'd rather eat less and pay more for great food.  Bench style seating on community tables is hard on the back (no back rests); very sleek modern style - interesting ever changing graphics projected on the walls.  I'd go back for the Veg Fried Rice and would like to try their other food.  Great quality!",3
review_189115,restaurant,"The best buffet in VEGAS hands down!!!!\n\nThe quality and taste of the food here is awesome.  It's like eating at a restaurant and not a buffet.  There are soo much to choose from that you'll be stuffed before you are able to walk through the entire line!  There are two dessert lines that are constantly being restocked because it tastes soo good.  Everything about this place is wonderful, and I have to eat here at least once when I visit Vegas.\n\nService is also great.  They take away the dirty plates really quickly and constantly refill your drinks.  The place is always kept clean, and it's definitely worth the extra bucks to eat here versus some of the other buffet places.",4

review_226235,restaurant,"You will always have a great meal here because you start off with their chips and bean dip.  I also love their Pollo Fundido.  Everything that I have had on the menu has been great.  Their only problem is sometimes their service is not the greatest.  When they get busy it is pretty difficult to get drink refills and orders from the bar.  I was pretty bummed out that I had to eat most of my meal without a cold beer.\nThey also have a great outdoor patio and on some night have a DJ and music.  This really is a great place to dine.  With a few improvements, this place would really be excellent!",2
review_318735,restaurant,"I opted to have lunch here after enjoying some early Christmas shopping at Tommy Bahamas. I could not have been more disappointed. The Hostess greated me nicely. I asked her if there were any Vegetarian options on the menu. She said \""oh yes.  We have several great options.\""  I was encouraged. I asked for a table on the patio. The hostess hesitated then said she didn't have any available. Would I like to sit near the open doors. I agreed and was seated. She removed the cutlery and napkin from the table and left me with a menu. Not sure why. Later when my food came I had to ask for cutlery and a napkin. While I looked over the menu I noticed three available tables on the patio- two 4-tops and one 2-top. The waitress came by to take my order and just as I was about to ask about the table outside the Hostess sat a couple at the 2-top. It was clear my being a single guest was a problem for them. Carrying on I ordered a glass of wine and asked what she recommended for vegetarian lunch. She said the veggie burger was very popular. She left to get my wine. When she came back I said I would like to have the veggie burger. She said they were all out. They haven't been able to get any for awhile. Really?  What now? I asked about the mango chicken salad. It said it could be served as a veggie dish. She said all they do is remove the chicken. The price would be the same either way. Yikes!  This just kept getting worse. I asked her to request the price be adjusted to reflect the removal of the protein. She spoke to the chef and came back with a yes. Thus my lunch was a plate of lettuce with some strips of mango. I enjoyed my wine and tolerated the salad just in time for the next blow. Rather than ask me directly if I would like some more wine or anything else, the server asked me if I wanted anything as she was heading through the door to the patio. It was as if she couldn't be bothered with a single diner .  Despite my awful experience I left a 15% tip and paid my bill. Tommy Bahamas you need to do much better than that!",1

review_556786,restaurant,"Loved this place when it was Salsa's.  It was small, the food was delicious and the service was always good.  I have been to Cabo's three times now.  \nThe first, was a little disillusioned by the fact that they only brought 3 tortillas for for Fajitas (two of us splitting) and then charged $1 when I asked for one more.  This never happened when it was Salsa's. They either brought extra to begin with or happily brought another free of charge.\nSecond time was ok.  We were the only patrons as it was early for lunch.  The workers were preparing for the crowd so the service was good. Food was ok.\nThird (and last?) time.  Just went a couple if days ago for lunch.  Service was slow even though there were only 5 or 6 tables seated.  The chips were old (one tasted like rancid oil-my guess is that it was left in the warmer bin.  Had to actually spit it out...yuck!)My enchilada came barely warm. Didn't eat most of it.  My daughter's food was ok. \nCabo's is just not consistently good to keep going.  Just ok every now and then is not good enough.\nNothing special here that is going to keep me coming back",1
review_527100,restaurant,"After too many happy hours to count I finally had dinner here.  I don't know why I waited so long!  My boyfriend and I started with the filet and mushroom skewers and bacon wrapped dates -- love these!  They are as good if not better then Firefly's.  For dinner we split the grilled rib-eye, and unlike most steakhouses it comes with sides included.  More then enough for two people and cooked perfectly.  At $36 for the 16 ounce rib-eye I thought that was a very fair price.  I am also a huge fan of their drink menu.  I usually stick to the red sangria but this night I had the Dirty Girl martini, pear based, and the Cacao Confusion, one of the best chocolate martinis I've ever had.  \n\nWhat I also love about Embers is the atmosphere.  You sit in the front or the bar and it's a happy hour vibe but sit in a booth toward the back and it's perfect for a romantic date night.",4
review_494903,restaurant,"The meal was extremely simple, underwhelming, and had no \""pizzazz\"".\n\nIt was my friends birthday, so I figured I would treat him, his girl, and myself to an awesome lunch. I had never been here before, but have only herd good things. \n\nAs soon as we walked in, we were rudely greeted by the one out of two hostesses that were at the host stand. No smile, no energy, no welcoming \""Thanks for joining us at our restaurant by spending your hard earned money and keeping me in the job\"" vibe, NOTHING. Crazy, in my opinion, we should have left, but didn't because the plans to eat here were already in affect. \n\nWe were seated promptly, and had a nice view of their wine room that is encased in glass. Pretty cool. Our server was very friendly, and had just started there a few months prior. She gave us some recommendations, and we followed through with them. \n\nFor my appetizer I ordered the \""Grilled Octopus\""(refer to pic)($10 additional fee). The octopus was charcoal-broiled perfectly, and was good. Maybe I like more \""Eclectic\"" food, but this was just so simple. The octopus was accompanied by red onions and capers with the plate being drizzled with oil. Nothing amazing, just good. We Also ordered the \""Milos Special\"", which was lightly fried zucchini and eggplant w/ tzatziki & kefalograviers cheese. This, center shared appetizer, was delicious! The zucchini and eggplant were fried PERFECTLY. The yogurt sauce, that was inside the stack of fried veggies, added such a nice tang, that really balanced all of flavors flawlessly and made all of us go back for more. \n\nThe birthday boy ordered the \""Crab Cake\""(refer to pic)($10 additional fee) appetizer. From what I tried, the cake was okay... just very simple, small, and had nothing special going on. The b-day boy regretted ordering it.\n\nFor my lunch entree I ordered the servers recommendation, the \""Lavraki\""(refer to pic). This Mediterranean bass is a \""specialty at Milos\"". After finding three(3) pin bones in my fish, I figured it wasn't as \""SPECIAL\"" as the server mentioned. The fish was cooked well, but once again... nothing special. When you are eating at such an upscale restaurant, you expect amazing flavors, quality, service, and atmosphere. It was blowing my mind that there was such a simplistic approach with no added spark, and still errors and missteps. \n\nMy friend ordered the \""Nova Scotia Deep Sea Lobster Pasta\""(refer to pic)($15 additional fee), which he thought was an absolute, complete joke. The pasta was tossed in a red, tomato sauce and was accompanied by the top and bottom half of the lobster, while the middle of the lobster was the pasta. It was absurd. The pasta came out lukewarm, and he didn't want to inconvenience anyone, so he didn't want to complain. I thought the pasta had some good flavors, but the presentation was... just a hot mess. \n\nFor dessert I had the server order for me. She brought out a \""Yogurt Martini\""(refer to pic) which was tangy, tart, and good for what it was.. Greek yogurt inside of a martini glass. The b-day boy ordered the \""Walnut Cake w/ Kaimaki Ice Cream\""(refer to pic) which we thought was moist, and delicious. I was envious of his dessert. No candle was given, or even a \""happy birthday\"" but that's understandable. All the other standards of food quality, service standards, etc.. were disappointing.\n\nOverall, the meal was a bust. We left not satisfied and extremely underwhelmed for my friends birthday. We will not return.",1
review_572997,restaurant,"Alright first things first: The service is phenomenal. The hostess was sweet and looked back twice to make sure we were following her. The server was hilarious (her name was Julia?) and she was spot-on the entire time. I noticed another server who was meticulously polishing silverware, flattening out napkins and folding them perfectly, and carefully setting his table as if it were for his very own wedding banquet. I rarely see this kind of attention to detail.\n\nThe restaurant is extremely clean. I was also impressed when the servers come around with a tray of sliced limes, lemons and oranges for our water and iced tea. Very impressed!\n\nThe food is a bit of a letdown. The thin crust pizza was surprisingly flabby. I mean, isn't thin crust pizza supposed to be crispy? The chicken Parmesan was burned. Why oh why put a pile of arugula on it and leave the sauce on the side? Fail. \n\nI'll be back, I suppose, but there's dozens of other restaurants to try out lol\n\nCome here for the service. Keep your expectations low on the food so that you won't be disappointed.",2

review_511050,restaurant,"A place I've had my eye on for a long time, there are a lot of thai places in Vegas and it was no surprise I haven't had a chance to come out here, but I was pleasantly surprised by the food.\n\nThe spice levels are no joke, with a level 8 on Pad See Ew burning my tongue a good amount. Oddly enough, I found it had more kick to me than my friend's spice level 10 linguini, but less of a smoky flavor. The Pad See Ew is well made here, and I have nothing to criticize on it.\n\nThe service was prompt and friendly enough, with the chef coming and asking us if we were okay with the spice level a couple of times. Several times people came in and were known by name, always a nice touch for the regulars. If this place was closer to me, I'm sure I'd have been here many times by now.\n\nThe only criticism I would have was that the thai ice tea that my friend ordered was too sweet and didn't have enough tea flavor. It was a point of mediocrity in an otherwise budget-friendly and taste-friendly meal.",3

review_400731,restaurant,"I order the same thing at every Vietnamese restaurant. Rice Vermicelli Bun with Grilled Pork and Egg Roll, and spring rolls. This order does not change. Ever.\n\nThey do the pork here more like a pork patty, or meatloaf if you will. In Vietnamese cuisine, there are two different ways to do it, the other being grilled slices of pork. I don't know which I prefer as they are very very different.\n\nYou get a large amount of noodles, very fresh vegetables, and a generous portion of meat. The sauce is tasty, and everything seems very high quality. Spring rolls are good, as is the peanut sauce they serve them with. The service could be worse, but not much. It's pretty horrendous. Atmosphere is typical of a Vietnamese restaurant, total dive.",3

The bartender I had the last time I was there was not the most sociable. When asking questions about the menu, she acted as if it was a hassle. Not the most welcoming.\n\nOverall, the food is great. If you go on Tuesdays it's $2 Corona's & $1 Taco's! Can't beat that.",3
review_126954,restaurant,"The closest thing to a Philly cheesesteak available in Las Vegas! It's very hard to find authentic cheesesteaks here, this is the place to get them. They are delicious! They also carry Tastykake products which takes you back to Philly. And the cheese wiz fries, yum!!",3
review_201501,restaurant,"Fast service, great food. \n\nI have had their oven baked omelette, oven baked pancake, strawberry crepes and waffles and they have all been delectable. Another plus is their waiting staff, they have all been very friendly and fast for coffee refills and overall service. \n\nThe only thing i don't like so far is their benches. They sink too far and make me feel swarmed. I recurrently take the sacrifice for their delicious breakfast carbs.",3
review_213346,restaurant,"My wife and I were staying at the New York New York hotel, and we stopped in here for a quick no-reservations meal before going to a show that night.\n\nFood:  I had a burger, which was fine; there's only so many ways to screw up a burger, after all.  My wife ordered an advertised special, which was steak and crab legs.  She told me they were the best crab legs she'd ever had, and they certainly appeared fresh and well-prepared; I've never seen anyone have such an easy time getting huge hunks of crab meat out of the shell, especially with snow crab.  So, based purely on those crab legs, they'd get a positive review.\n\nService:  Here's where things fell apart.  Our server was apparently the slowest in the restaurant, which was not at all busy (we'd arrived just after 5, which is really early for dinner in Vegas).  We didn't get out of there until 6:45.  People who arrived after us got their drinks and meals before us, paid, and left before we even finished our meals.  It took him 25 minutes from the time we ordered it to bring dessert!  I mean, it's not like they had to bake the cheesecake or anything!  We really had to hustle to make it to our show, even though we felt we'd allowed plenty of time before we stopped for dinner.  Of course, when it came time to pay the check, he miraculously turned into Mr. Speedy.\n\nSo, three stars:  good food, slow service.",2
review_302709,restaurant,"I am surprised at how many positive reviews this place has received.  I was so excited to try this place because others had talked up how good it was. I live in Phoenix and the selection of sushi restaurants there is phenomenal!  I went here for lunch with my sister and ordered a lunch special.  I tried to force it down, but was unable to.  Maybe they were having an off day or the sushi was old...either way I will not be back to find out.",1

review_177353,restaurant,"Wasn't very thrilled ...\n\nShrimp overly battered, you ate batter mostly and then a tiny little shrimp.\n\nSpring rolls were very hard to bite into then very chewy/doughy from the inside.\n\nSushi was just cold and old. \n\n\nPizza selected with little selections (every kind had either pepperoni or is loaded with cheese- no selection for vegetarians).\n\nService was EXCELLENT, the waiters/ waitresses. \n\nAir was really stuffy, the restaurant is located in the Casio area, then again of course the air is stuffy everywhere in Las Vegas.\n\nAlborro? rice mixed with olives and corn had lots of oil in it. It was gross. \n\n3/4 different kinds of salmon were under cooked or overly battered. \n\nYes I sampled a lot of food, that's what buffets are for.",1
review_403906,restaurant,"If you are looking for Chicago style pizza--DO NOT go here. The sausage-- what little there was of it was spicy, the tomato sauce had no taste, the cheese was rubbery.\nThe thin crust was thin but the squares were as large as the plate and you needed a saw to cut through them. If you want Chicago style pizza stick with Rosati's or Aurelio's. Service was good but the pizza was horrible.",0
review_202301,restaurant,"What a great experience (twice)!  We went for supper on a busy night and ordered the tasting menu with the wine pairing.  It was a perfect dining affair: Each dish was presented beautifully and tasted even better, the wine was gorgeous and the service was flawless.  Yes, the chef's tasting menu is bit pricier than ordering a standard three-course meal a la carte, but when you factor in the cost of the lobster pot pie alone, it actually comes out to a great deal.\n\nThis dish is one of Michael Mina's signatures and now I see what all the hype is about.  It's deconstructed, so it's cooked in a pot, and placed on your dish directly from that pot, with all the parts (crust, vegetables, perfectly cooked lobster).  Don't expect a bunch of creamy filling like something from the freezer section of your local grocery.  It's a pot pie EVOLUTIONIZED.  I am not usually a big lobster fan, but I would order this again, on it's own, any day.  I won't go into detail on the other dishes, but they too were amazing.\n\nAfter a few pre-dinner drinks at the bar and all the wine pairing, I was pretty looped by the time we got to dessert.  So excited was I about the Hungarian Tokaji that was our dessert pairing that I knocked it over after just two sips.  The server, knowing how much I had looked forward to that moment was kind enough to pour me another glass, even fuller than the first one.  Another memo on the service: So many restaurants think that the definition of good service is only to be pleasant and knowledgeable (which are important), but I also believe that an integral part of an extraordinary meal is attentiveness.  The wait staff had everything timed succinctly, from serving and taking away dishes, to making sure they didn't come over too early or ask questions while we had food in our mouths.  And yes, my water glass was also replenished before it was gone.\n\n*Note: If you can get a booth instead of a table in the dining room, go for it.  It's cozy, comfortable and great for people watching.\n\nThe second night we were having supper somewhere else, but stopped in for drinks before hand (let's face it, cocktails at the casino bars are just boring).  The hostess, bartender and waiter all remembered us from the night before.  We started off ordering some of the specialty drinks from their drinks menu, then the bartender/drink master started making custom concoctions for us and we ended for staying for 2 hours and just barely made it to our dinner reservations.  *Disclosure: One would have to assume that when your bar bill is a few C-notes, the drinks and the service better be good.\n\nI would recommend Nob Hill to anyone who loves food, regardless of your palette preferences.  There is something for everyone, even if your diet is only liquid.",4
review_204998,restaurant,"I came here for breakfast, mainly because we had 2 complimentary buffet tickets as part of staying at New York New York, and MGM was just a bridge walk across the street. We arrived a little before 11 AM on Saturday morning and didn't have to wait all that long to get in - after getting through the first line (for the register) and the second line (waiting to get seated), we probably were all seated within 10 minutes. Since you serve yourself, there's not much to discuss in that arena, although the waitresses are very keen on refilling your champagne glasses without even asking if you want more...I would imagine it's quite easy to get yourself quite loaded before the morning is even out.\n\nAs for the food - most of it is standard brunch fare, but a great deal of it isn't all that fresh. The bacon was all over the map -  some pieces were too chewy, other pieces were overly crisp. Scrambled eggs were okay, if not terribly fluffy given how long they were sitting there. While I liked the flavor of the corned beef hash, it was way too dry. The tiny biscuits were good, but again - some were too dried out from sitting under hot lights for who knows how long. The spicy Polish sausage was probably the best thing I ate here, but that's not saying much - I've had better (and fresher) sausage elsewhere.\n\nIf you get your meal comped, you may as well show up. Otherwise, I'd probably stick with seeing what a traditional breakfast joint in Vegas would be like. If anything, it reminds me of why I haven't been at buffets in a long time (aside from encouraging me to stuff my face more than I should).",1
review_93081,restaurant,"This place is so overrated! Being Asian and I spent 1/2 of my earning on eating out, I think I know Chinese food. This place is not that good people. \n\nthe restaurant is tacky, the chopsticks and condiment dishes are grimy, and the smell of the menu is weird, yeah take a whiff if you ever eat there.\n\nI ordered the house specialty : mi vit tiem . It was disappointing. the noodle, veggie, and the meat only filled up half the bowl if that. i asked for dry noodle with soup on the side, and they gave me a tiny bowl soup with some onion. if that wasn't enough, the duck smells off and it was too dry. i also asked for pickled  papaya as a side dish but they gave me kimchi instead, which is weird because kimchi is korean what the hell is it doing in china?",1
review_178896,restaurant,"Never again!  We had our choice of restaurants and chose this one over 5 others in the Miracle Mile Mall.  Horrible food.  We were sat down right away and then went for our food.  I could not finish one item and tried many.  We wanted to order drinks, but our server must have finished his shift and never saw him again.  Our plates and the plates of other customers piled up and nobody was clearing.  Again, the food was really bad.  Save you money and go somewhere else.  I would not eat here again, even if it was free which it was this time.",0
review_151142,restaurant,"I'm on the fence on this one. All fellow Yelpers have summed it up pretty nicely for this place so I'm only going to contribute as far as my overall experience, and not the food. With that being said, Grimaldi's Pizza is just as good (minus the wait).\n\nPay attention: If you go with a group of 4 or more, be prepared to wait mostly due to the fact that they do not go in the order you were put on the wait list. This is very important to note. They will fill circles of 2's and 3's around and before you before your group ever even lays eyes on that infamous brick oven.  \n\nI went with a large group of people (7 ppl), and we had to wait for.... wait for it........... 6 HOURS. SEIS HORAS! I'm convinced that not only is the wine bar next door owned by Bianco but the Irish pub as well. They are making a ton of money making you wait if that were true.....\n\nIf you are prepared to wait, you have to bring your own entertainment. For real. This place has that whole leisure European \""what's the rush?\""  feel to it. This means engaging in long and stimulating, thought-provoking conversation. Bring a game of monopoly. or chess! I do not recommend this place for a first date as boredom may creep in and put the pressure on to find common interests.... besides the pizza.",2
review_494073,restaurant,"I am truly shocked at the wide array of ratings Twist has received, as the party of four foodie friends I dined with here this past weekend agreed it was one of our best meals ever!\n\nIn looking at the reviews, I wonder if it is specifically the tasting menu that is disappointing? We did take a pass on it, as there were so many interesting-sounding items on the regular menu, and of course with 4 people you can share an even wider variety of dishes. \n\nThe dishes were wonderfully prepared, and brilliantly conceived! Everyone ordered an appetizer and an entree, a drink, and we were too full to even entertain dessert. The total was $120/person including tax and tip - I have had less interesting fine-dining experiences and paid much, much more.",4
review_464126,restaurant,I wanted so much to love this place based on the reviews. Surprisingly the best thing we had here was the char su rice bowl which was awesome.

review_445760,restaurant,"This would be a 5-star review if they served beer. I love the Italian Stalian pizza; it's delicious! The spicy pizza sauce has just the right kick of heat. I also really enjoyed the crust; it had a seasoning to it as well.We took home the leftovers and they tasted great the next day too!\n\nThe bad news, they no longer serve Sausage Smackers, which is a real shame because they give the pizzeria something all it's own. The side salad is just that, nothing too fancy.\n\nOverall, this is a great place for food, but get it to go if you want to enjoy a nice cool drink with it.",3

review_630376,restaurant,"What a great visit! I've been driving by this plaza for quite a long time now and an impromptu date night led us to finally give West End Bar & Grill a try. Boy am i glad we did! \n\nNestled in a back corner of the lot behind Goodwill, it's definitely off the beaten track. You can't see it from the street, you have to pull in to the lot and head to the southeast corner of the back lot. And don't let the golf carts out front fool you--this place is BIG, FUN, and not just for the Geriatric crowd of Sun City West!\n\nWe enjoyed the wings for an appetizer. The wings were big and meaty with a nice crunchy coating.  I enjoyed the Veggie sandwich which was a portabello mushroom sandwich with mozzarella cheese and mixed greens on flat bread. It had a great pesto and balsamic dressing as well. It was EXCELLENT. My husband had the special which was a taco salad with a FREE margarita or beer. He had the marg. The taco salad was just the right size, fresh, and plenty meaty. We also had dessert--a lemon bar sundae. Everything was really very good. \n\nOur server was friendly, interesting, and not intrusive at all. The other staff members were also friendly as well when they worked near our table, checking on us and removing plates as needed.  \n\nI am really looking forward to going back to West End. This place is a diamond in the rough here in Surprise and supporting small, local businesses whenever possible is what I'm all about!",3

review_336461,restaurant,"The setup and atmosphere of the place is really cool!! It is very upscale but I felt very relaxed and the place was not stuffy.\n\nThe service was fantastic, we made reservations and were seated immediately. Our waiter was great, he was attentive, entertaining, and took time to explain everything and answer all of our questions.\n\nThe food came and was pretty good, I had the ribeye medium rare, but should have ordered rare as it was a bit overdone for my personal taste. We also ordered the lobster tail which was also tasty. The sides were enormous, complimented the meat well and otherwise were unremarkable.\n\nWe had heard the place was pricey and were prepared for a large bill. The ribeye, lobster tail, two sides, a dessert, and two drinks came to about $250. Even though the place was quite good, I sit on the fence as to whether it was worth that much money. I guess I would put it this way: I think the meal was well above average, but I can still think of several restaurants that will serve an above average meal at half the price. If you've never been and want a cool experience, go and enjoy, just be prepared to pay quite a bit for it at the end.",2
review_378318,restaurant,Don't go to the Sunday seafood buffet if you want fresh food. Not worthy of the $39.99. The crab was just OK. The cold shrimp were dreadful. They poured way too much ice on it so they became flavorless and soggy. The prime rib and dessert was pretty good though. But everything else was just not like it used to be. When they first opened they really payed attention to detail. Now it seems like management just don't give a crap cause it showed in the food.,0

And last but certainly not least - the Mac & Cheese. It was awful...just straight from the Kraft box!  And not even made well - too watery, hardly any flavor. To the waitress's credit, she did offer me another type of Mac & Cheese but said that it would take about 30 minutes to make. I would have taken her up on the offer, but I was already hungry and not about to wait a half an hour just to be potentially disappointed again.\n\nSo if I ever come back here (big IF) then I will be happy to update my review and I'll even try some of their bbq...it would only be appropriate since this is a bbq place.",1

I prefer not to get ecoli with my chicken Alfredo thanks!  The foods  alright if you get a decent chef it's usually never consistent I'm guessing there's a high chef turnover.  The tables there aren't any cleaner as there's always dirty dishes or bugs crawling around I'm guessing cause of all the plants but hey if you want bugs in your food go ahead.the staff is rude and good luck trying to speak with a manager they never come to the phone .The young lady on the phone told me their not allowed to give them the phone they can only take messages.So as you can see they don't care about the customers.id prefer to take my money else where and bug free!!,0

review_414600,restaurant,"Fred's is exactly how I imagined a Barney's restaurant would be. Everything is trendy and stark. And from the menu down to the seating, everything in the restaurant just exudes \""cool.\"" But, cool enough or not, I gave it a go and I'm happy I did!\n\nI've been hearing about Fred's Sunday brunch since they opened. With a Bourbon Street brunch menu and live New Orleans jazz, it sounded like a perfect spot to take my Mom who was visiting from out of town. And it was! As we entered, I noticed how the restaurant is bright and open and allows you to look down into Old Town. The decor was cool (of course) with blacks, whites and grays. We sat down in a comfortable window seat booth near the live musician singing and playing jazz on the piano. The staff was immediately friendly and the menu offered us our choice of a variety of options ranging from salads, to brunch to pizza. In honor of Sunday brunch, I went for the Italian's version of huevos rancheros made with their homemade bruschetta and my Mom opted for the Chicken Salad. The iced tea was refreshing and I could have solely focused on the variety bread they brought out and I would have been satisfied.\n\nMy meal was good but a little too rich for my appetite. It was flowing with a sauce that resembled marina sauce and it came with a side of potatoes. If you like huevos rancheros and you like Italian food, this would be a good choice. Unfortunately it just wasn't exactly what I was hoping for but still quite delicious and it's not Fred's fault that I ordered something just too rich for my appetite this visit. I ended up having some of my Mom's chicken salad which was light and fresh. The dressing was a little light but it still had a nice taste to it. I really liked it and secretly coveted her decision.\n\nI really enjoyed the atmosphere at Fred's and it's a perfect place to relax and catch up. Next time I return, I'll go the salad route or possibly the Bourbon Street Brunch which sounded amazing.",3

It was really nice outside, so we opted to sit outdoors. \n\nI ordered the \""best egg omelette you'll ever have\"", spicy harissa style. It's an omelette w/ provolone cheese, spinach, tomatoes and avocado. It also comes with a field greens salad tossed in lemon vinaigrette & french baguette bread. Never do I think of eating a salad with my omelette but I gave it a go. The omelette was absolutely delicious-dare I say it might've been one of the best I've ever eaten. It was spicy but not overpowering. I'm not usually a fan of avocado but it paired well with the omelette. The salad was absolutely delicious and the bread was warm and fresh tasting.  \n\nService was overall, pretty good. There was a few times where I waited a little longer than I would expect for water refills, and the server brought us our check by the time we decided to order another drink-which may have been our fault but that's okay. \n\nI will definitely be back again, maybe for dinner another time since apparently they make a great veggie burger.

They have a beautiful fish tank, music isn't too loud, and TVs are on the back wall.\n The waitstaff were friendly and efficient. My avocado smoothie was amazing; one of the best I have had in a long time. My pho was great. I love that the chicken pho was made with chicken broth and not beef broth!",3

review_97148,restaurant,"YIKES!  There is no way this place deserves five stars!  The pizza was so bad I had to go to Fry's to get something else for lunch... but then again, I guess at $4 for two slices and a drink, you get what you pay for.\n'Homey' is not a word I would use to describe this place.  The family of aggressively accented men who run the place are probably the most interesting thing about it... but it's not enough to make up for the rest of it.  I am definitely not coming back.  Just gross.",0

You have access to set reservations on Open Table, but again, no message was received that THEY WERE ON VACATION!

review_37785,restaurant,"This restaurant is in my \""hood\"" and I had heard good things about the pizza muffins so I had to give it a try. \n\nIt was busy on a Friday night but we only waiting about 10 mins for our table.  The servers were on top of things as far as I could see.  Our server was at out table in two seconds taking drink orders.  Since it was our first time there I wanted to look over the menu.  He gave us sufficient time and then he was back, took our order, and salad and breadsticks for my daughter arrived in about 5 mins.  The pizza muffins were right behind........ahhhh....these are like crack to me.  I'm instantly addicted!  Little wheels of pizza dough with chesse and ham, fresh and hot and gooey.  YUM!!!!  I should have just made a meal off the pizza muffins but I had to try the pizza.  My daughter had a Jr. Pizza with her favorite topping, black olives.  She gave it a big thumbs up.\nI tried one with sausage, salami and mushrooms.  The dough was soft, cooked to perfection and has a nice flavor.  The toppings were generous.  It was good and I took the rest home.  \n\nIt seems as thought everyone there were regulars, locals.  The service was fast and friendly. I thought the prices were very resonable. When we were ready to leave my daughter needed a to go cup for the rest of her drink.  Our server kindly obliged and brought her a to go cup.....filled with more of her drink!  We will be back!  I'm sure I will be craving pizza muffins very soon!!",3
review_216053,restaurant,"Wow how over rated can a place get? outside of the warm Thyme bread to start, the entire meal was a disappointment. From the arrogance of the chef tasting menu where they don't tell you whats on the menu yet choose 90% of the items off the menu to the overly complex combination of simple ingredients. Its obvious that Phoenix residents are so used to eating at strip malls with their chain restaurants that this place impresses them. Save your money and eat elsewhere",1
review_194985,restaurant,"Interesting. I came here in the middle of the week. With that said, I expected it to be subpar since its cheaper for lunch. Of course most buffets bust out the good stuff for dinner/on the weekends. \n\nHonestly there was nothing too memorable about this place, beside the custom crepe making station, which I took advantage of of course. The food was different since it seems to be French based, so don't to find mush Asian cuisine (if any) or American food for that matter. I mean the ambiance is nice since the entire district where the buffet is modeled to look like Paris. The service was ok here though. As nice as our server was, she kinda dragged in getting our plates cleared and getting us our drinks. Maybe if i come here during the weekend or for dinner, I'll enjoy this place more.\n\nI ran out of things to say.",1
review_173683,restaurant,"I seriously need to thank this place for providing such stellar service. After a nightmarish meal at an Italian restaurant in the Miracle Mile, I was thrilled to come here and feel more welcomed. *high five*\nBouchon has never disappointed me. This is only for brunch though, I can't say anything for lunch or dinner. I've tasted the pomme frites, chicken and waffles, croque madame, profiteroles, brioche and jam and hibiscus drink. \nThe pomme frites are crisp to perfection. The bread on the croque is nicely toasted and tastes wonderful with the gooey runny egg- however, I prefer mine with a fully cooked egg. The chicken and waffles are probably my favorite. Compared to Roscoe's, it's a different experience all together. You don't have to use the syrup because the waffle has this nutty flavor alone. Topped with a piece of chicken and a smear of butter and you're good to go! The chicken is beautifully fried with all the flavors coming from the meat itself, not the batter. \nI love bread and Bouchon has the BEST bread and vanilla bean butter on earth!!!! Everything is better with butter- lemme tell you! Just remember that the vanilla bean butter only comes with the Chicken & Waffles dish and may cost extra if you order it alone. Also get the profiteroles which are tiny fried pieces of dough (fancy donuts if you will).",3
review_322338,restaurant,"As a resident of Belmont I've visited Sammy's several times. Food is average, atmosphere is a sports bar pub with several tv's to watch sporting events. Hard to carry on a normal conversation with the loud background noise bouncing off walls, floors and ceiling.Acoustic panels  were installed but still too loud. It's got a decent selection of beers and wine but overly priced. It's just ok but no wow factor. Wait staff friendly and attentive. I'll still go occasionally but have other local places we prefer.",2
review_576298,restaurant,"I'm always on the lookout for new places to try for lunch...and after seeing Nelson Q. rave about the 50's Diner and how it was locally owned I decided to give it a try. \n\nDecor wise it's literally a 50's Diner...it's not as glitzy as places closer to Las Vegas Blvd. But if you judge a book by it's cover you're going to miss out on a gem. Service? Phenomenal. This is a family owned business and it shows. But as good as it is to support small, family owned businesses it's all about the food. So does this diner get it done? Yes they do. \n\nThey have a pretty good menu with a lot of items but I'm from the Midwest so when trying something new I tend to stick with the classics like in this case a 3 egg omelet, with sourdough toast and potato slices. I'm not a big potato fan but these slices were a nice change from the usual hash browns you see so much of. I went with a California omelet and was very pleased with it. Lots of chicken, peppers, avocado...it was really filling and really good. \n\nI want to go back and try their sandwiches and other items on the menu. I'm glad I read Nelson's comments and took the time to check this place out. 4 Stars. I will be back.",3
review_440827,restaurant,There was a little 'oops' with the order (it was split in two) and the person on the phone spoke very little English to help.\n\nThe food was very good. Nice sized portions. Good flavor and delivered in their proper container (meaning it wasn't all spilled out every where)\n\nWill definitely use them again!,3
review_457891,restaurant,"In town for a conference, so this wasn't my first choice of places to eat, but when you're with a group, you make concessions. \n\nBeing from California, I know that gluten-free menus are very easy to come by in the Golden State, but in the southeast, gluten-free still gets blank stares at many spots. Mortimer's was a good example of that. The host looked at me like I was speaking a foreign language when I asked about a gluten-free menu. No matter, I would figure something out. \n\nThe server was a little better (and actually, very friendly). She at least knew what gluten free was and knew to check with the cook about certain items (the fries and nachos, for example, are not gluten-free). \n\nA wine list? I didn't expect one, but she gladly brought one over after twenty minutes of looking for it. It had two house wines and five other wines. None of them were good. But that was to be expected.\n\nThe real problems came when dealing with my sandwich, which I figured could be made without bread to accommodate the gluten-free. It never came. The rest of the party ordered, got their appetizers, their dinners, their drinks - finished everything, and mine still hadn't arrived.\n\nI inquired and apparently (surprise) it was never made. They made it in about ten minutes and it was okay bar food with roast beef and melted cheese directly on the plate since there was no bread. (Most places that do gluten-free modifications for sandwiches put the meat, etc. on lettuce just to make it more visually appealing if nothing else.)\n\nI debated on two or three stars for this review. The rest of my party wasn't that impressed with their food, so I went with the lower rating of two stars, even though the server had a very friendly smile and seemed somewhat apologetic over the lack of their ability to accommodate my dining needs. \n\nBeing a bar, it's probably not in their best interest to develop a full gluten-free menu. That's not their real clientele. However, with the Convention Center so close and lots of  hotels around with guests, it might make sense for them to at least educate the staff on what gluten is so that they can easily modify existing menu items to fit those needs.",1

review_640789,restaurant,"Warning!!! Do not go to this steak house and order seafood. I had a craving for some oysters so after the waiter recommendation I ordered the seafood platter for 2 and expected nice big plump oysters, shrimp, king crab, and lobster but instead got the total opposite. For the high price they charge we got small portions where the oysters were the size of a half dollar with barely any meat and the so called jumbo shrimp was medium size that was literally the same size as the lobster and the king crab leg was so skinny it looked like it was from somebodies leftovers (See photos).\nThe popover bread that came out was huge which gave me the  impression that the entree and sides will be the same. I ordered the veal chop, while the wife had the main lobster, the kids shared the braised short ribs and our friend had a steak. The waiter told us that the sides were big enough to share so we ordered mash potatoes, asparagus and wild mushrooms. When the food came out the veal chop and braised rib looked and tasted good but the lobster again was tiny along with the sides. The portion of the mash potato was a joke - 2 spoons and it was gone; how can that be enough for even one person let alone sharing.  Same for the asparagus and mushrooms.\nSpending over $400 plus tip we left feeling unfulfilled and hungry.",0
review_151261,restaurant,"I have heard about and read about this place for many years but never got to try it. My brother came into town and his boss said for him to try it out. So we went downtown and because of the reviews we purposefully went early. We got there around 4:45. Just in time for the Zombie walk. Lucky us. So we were told it would be an hour and a half wait. We went next door to the bar and each had a glass of wine and the antipasti and crostini. $60 later..  \n\nWe get a table. We each got a pizza and I got the farmers market salad to share. It was priced according to the items they put into it. It was $9. It had lettuce, and red onion and blue cheese which we got on the side. Really. It was not large. It had nothing else on it. To me that's not a salad. I thought being a farmers market salad there would be other veggies on it but I guess the market was closed.\n\nThe pizza was unremarkable. It wasn't even very warm. I like cold pizza too but this didn't make it. And It was worse the next day.  \n\nI love trying new places. I love pizza and salad. I just can't find a thing to make me go back to this place.  Not even if someone else was paying.",1

Guess everyone wanted outside seating in the beautiful weather.  Ordered a shot on the menu that sounded yummy - but wasn't.   Cheese crisp was burnt.  Green salsa, as others have said was sweet but I loved it.  Food was good but not great.  The shining star in our meal was the server, Tara.  She was very on top of everything even though very busy.  And I was impressed that she asked my permission before serving my 11 year old refills on soda.  We may or may not try this again.  Wanted to be thrilled since it is within walking distance.",2

Arrived on a cold evening so spicy food sounded good.\n\nStarted off with complimentary hot tea and followed with mapo tofu, spicy shredded pork and boiled fish stew.

The mapo tofu and shredded pork were just as yummy and the portions were decent.\n\nThe waitress who was younger and from northern China was friendly, spoke good English and had only been in the US for a few months.

review_459753,restaurant,"I would have given more stars but service was yuck and the food did not make up for it. Went in for happy hour with our boys on Saturday night, not busy inside at all- a bit busy on patio but more than enough staff to cover it all. The waitress was either right out of high school or still in high school.. She was about as bright as a dim light bulb when the power is about to go out. She took our order and took a joke my husband made as serious and we has to correct her before she walked away. Then she brought my beer in a bottle and didn't even bother to ask if I wanted a glass with it... Really? And then (just to spare you the other silly details of her inexperience) my husbands sprite was empty and he also has a water-- she started to re-fill the sprite glass with water, even though they put cucumber and lemon in ALL their water glasses... Ummmmm.  Ok-- I was about done.. Then we asked for the check and it took like 10 minutes to get it-- again-- still not busy. Food was good, nothing special to write home about-- good sushi, good HH prices.. Good appetizers.. Just with they would hire some more competent staff.",1

review_493293,restaurant,"Having been to The Bazaar by Jose Andres and loved it, I was excited to try some of his more traditional fare.  Overall, I thought this meal was fun and an overall success.  We came here on a Sunday night without reservations but were seated right away as a table had just become available.  This is off to a good start!\n\nWe started with the Aceitunas ($12 for 4 anchovy stuffed green olives and 4 kalamata olive spheres made from sodium alginate).  I've had Jose's black olive spheres at the Bazaar and actually thought the kalamatas work much better.\n\nNext, we had the Chistorra Envuelta ($8 for 6 skewers).  The spicy chorizo  was quite tasty and contrasted perfectly with the crunchiness of the potato chip wrapped around the  skewer.\n\nThe waitress highly recommended the Gambas al Ajillo ($10 for 6 shrimps) which the menu features as one of their most popular dishes.  Maybe it was high expectation from the waitress and the menu, but I thought the shrimp wasn't really anything special.  Sure it was perfectly cooked, but it just tasted like nicely cooked shrimp with garlic oil.\n\nMy favorite dish of the night was easily the Pinchon Estilo Alcantara which was squab topped with foie gras and shaved black truffle ($22).  All the flavors came together so well.. I would have ordered this plate just for myself.. who says sharing is caring?\n\nThe Rape a la Donostiarra ($10 for a large platter of thinly sliced monkfish) was pretty solid.  The waitress said it was a brave dish.. I've never had monkfish prepared this way before, but didn't think it was anything overly eccentric.\n\nFinally, we had the Arroz a Banda con Bogavante ($28) which is their lobster paella.  I was really looking forward to this, since we were sitting right next to the paella station.  As a quick note, they only serve 2 paellas at any given night, and could take up to 30 minutes to prepare, so be aware that not all options are going to be available.  The paella was quite rich and tasty.. a tad over-seasoned, but that's ok.  Each dish is served with half a lobster tail and a claw, which was a nice touch.\n\nWe had our meal with a pitcher of red sangria, which I highly recommend.  You can never really go wrong with wine mixed with fruit.\n\nOverall, Jaleo was pretty much what I expected from Jose Andres - tasty, modern Spanish cuisine.  I can't wait to come back to try everything else on the menu.  Definitely come in a group to maximize the selection.  I thought our party of 6 was perfect, since most of the dishes come in groups of 6.  Also, I actually thought the price was fairly reasonable for what we were getting.\n\n4 stars!!",3

Was disappointed when it moved to its new location, because I loved that old ambiance. But still has great food and awesome selection of local beer...the type I brag about to my friends who have not been fortunate enough to experience Wisconsin and its brewed offerings. The dark wood, semi private booths, old time music, and soft lighting make this a pleasant place for a meal or a beer. Highly recommend. Glad I stopped in to reminisce.",3

review_409156,restaurant,"I gave this place 2 stars, not because of the menu, I never tasted the food but more of the rudeness of the hostess. We went here the other week on a Sat night at 6:00. I had been looking forward to trying this place since I had heard good things of it. The minute we walked in there were about 4 tables filled and no one in the bar. The rude hostess looks up, does not bother to smile and says with a snappy tone \""do you have a reservation\""? My wife and I looked around and said no, we did not think we needed one at 6:00. She replied that they were completely booked up, even in the bar. The fact that they were booked did not bother me (even though they were nowhere near full). It was more the attitude of the hostess who offered no solutions explanations as to why we could not even eat at the bar. The service at this place turned me off so much I am really not interested in trying the menu. There are plenty of other burger joints in this town.",1

The croissants themselves were light, buttery, and flaky. The egg in the sandwich was fluffy and scrambled, with melted cheese in it. The Bavarian cream had a decent amount of filling in it, although a little more would have been nice!\n\nThe egg sandwich was $5.25 and the Bavarian cream was $2.25.

Everything had gluten or wheat in it when it came from the manufacturer or else they added it. So, there was nothing there I could eat, according to her.

I would say stay away from the sandwiches and main meals and you're good.\n\nThe pizzas are like no other and the pasta is fresh and flavourful. My favorite is the Gladiatore and the gluten free pasta. The butcher's block is 18$ and the amount of cheese alone on that plate cost about that much if not more. It is a great value. I've eaten at too many restaurants in Montreal AND Centropolis to not appreciate a place like Mozza. \n\nThe portions are more than generous and the pizzas are perfectly cooked. If you are a fan of Italian food - NOT fusion Italian but actual simple, fresh Italian food- than you go to Mozza. 16$ for a plate of pasta that size and 15-20$ for a family pizza with fresh toppings, but so fresh you can taste it, is not a very expensive price to pay. I've been to Mozza on as many Saturdays as Tuesdays and the quality of food doesn't change. \n\nThe alcohol and the deserts are pricey but you haven't tasted a nutella calzone like the one you do at Mozza. \n\nIf you're not into restaurant experiences that revolve around the waiter  presenting you with a bottle of sparkling water like it was an aged fine wine...then youll enjoy this place. It's good, fresh food at the best value I've seen in Montreal OR Laval....even if I seem to be the only one who says so on Yelp.",4

review_282827,restaurant,"07/09/2008  \nJust went there last week for the first, and last, time.  I read the good reviews, so I was expecting much more.  I am a first generation American; both my parents were German and came over in their 20's.  I lived there for a few years, have eaten German food all my life, and have been to many German restaurants in many different states over the years.  I really wanted to like this place, as there are not many German establishments around here, but this place was terrible!  We were the only people in the place at 2pm, and still had horrible service.  ???  We were ignored much of the time and then when the waitress did come, she would forget things we had asked her for.  The waitress didn't understand German, as in the German MENU options, so I ordered from the menu using the English translations, and she was still confused. I had to POINT at the options.  YES, there really is CUCUMBER salad on the menu.  The bread was stale, the schnitzel was hard, there was a hair in my cucumber salad and my potato pancakes were just ...disgusting.  They also gave me fries instead of the usual sides????  I am guessing that they just reheated leftovers from the dinner the night before, because that is exactly what it tasted like.  Plus, I actually got charged the wrong prices - like lunch salad was 3.50, but showed up on my bill as 5.00, etc.  I was too frustrated to even bring it up and just left, disappointed.  Waste of time and money, I will not return.  Maybe at dinner time things are better, but DO NOT EVEN TRY THE LUNCH!  Yuck.\nOh, and the website is outdated- wrong prices and discontinued menu items.",0
review_640304,restaurant,"Oh my jesus is this place the bomb. Best burger I have ever had so far in my 32 years of life on this planet. You very seriously cannot go wrong in any burger you choose. Oh, and get the blue cheese fries because WOAH. I could just eat those little bad boys forever. They were so good even the kids liked them (this is a huge deal, you guys). We were so uncomfortabley full after our delicious, mouth-watering, delectable burgers, fries and chips - but, we were on vacation - so of course this didn't stop us from ordering shakes. Salted Caramel Pretzel shakes for the kids and I forget the exact name but some sort of hard shake with apples and bacon goodness for the man-friend and I. I was on the verge of explosion after this evening of pure, unadulterated gluttony and boy was it worth it. I HIGHLY recommend dining at this local chain, and if you live close, coming on a regular basis! So so so amazingly good. I wish we lived closer!",4

review_535255,restaurant,I was told ahead of time this would be the best BBQ I've ever had. I question if the person that told me this has actually ever had BBQ before. The atmosphere was great especially eating in the room with the shark tank. But the food was lack-luster and I would not call that KC BBQ. Maybe they are using KC Masterpiece as their BBQ sauce... which in itself isn't Kansas City BBQ either. \n\n  No one's meal was all that great and if we weren't already there for the zoo we would had been even more displeased with out trip.,1

I can't get enough of the truffle cheese whiz!",2
review_303505,restaurant,"It's Vegas.  I go there with good company, for cool conversation, great memories, and lastly - for excellent food.  Carnevino was just that. \n\nKnowing that the three of us would be heading over to a club for some drunk-man's hokey-pokey within a few hours, we took the server's advice and split the two-person bone-in rib-eye, three ways.  Of course you can't have dinner without an appetizer.  \n\nOur taste-buds tingled at the sound of the featured bruschetta: soft and creamy mozarella nestled on a bed of kale, with some playful specs of pancetta hiding in between the wrinkly leaves.  The plate was gorgeous. The mozzarella was so creamy - tangled between the grooves of our forks, then twirled with a little piece of kale, picking up some pancetta bits, eventually finding its way onto a rough patch of bruschetta. LOVELY. \n\nMid conversation, our server appeared table-side with a wooden chopping block on wheels!  He prepared us - \""Excuse me,\"" he says kindly. \""If I may shuffle some things around here...\""  THEN the monstrosity of a rib-eye appeared from underneath the little table!  For that type of entrance, they should have blared the trumpets and sounded the cymbals.  The server gently carved the steak, artfully plated it, and so delicately sprinkled some salt and drizzled some olive oil over the medium-rare slices of meat.  MAGICAL.  At some point, we found ourselves slightly confused by the humongous rib that lay so peacefully across a little plate - what to do?  Nothing else to do but to pick it up and savor the flavors of the bone that oozed into the meat.  Don't question it.  DO IT. \n\nGreen beans came in a little cast-iron tray -  they too were delightful.  Golden raisins and lemon zest all joined the party.  Such a subtle, yet fun combination of flavors bouncing around in the mouth.  \n\nService: 5-stars (or smiley faces)\nFlavors: 5-stars. \nAtmosphere: 5-stars.\n\nPricey.  But really - can you put a price on excellent food and unforgettable memories?",4

review_197177,restaurant,Pretty good for Asian food on the strip. Normally there is a long line but we went around 3pm and didn't have to wait. As per the name the noodles are better than the non-noodle-y dishes.\n\nGot the braised beef noodle (yum) and the spicy Thai seafood noodle (ok). The braised beef noodle had pretty authentic chunks of beef including tendon (!!!) and a lot of flavor. The Thai seafood noodle was pretty fragrant but they might've gone a little overboard on the lemongrass.\n\nIt actually pretty reasonably priced for the strip - each noodle bowl was under $20.\n\nStay away from the dumplings.,2
review_123402,restaurant,I've seen a lot of reviews here... Complaining about the service... I think most of you need to chill a bit... Could the service be a tad better... Yeah it could...

You Only will be missing a great dining experience.... Huge menu even better preparation... My only complaint is I ate too much.... I usually bring food home...

It cost $10 bucks and I kid you not we only got 15 little chips and the whole thing was so salty we couldn't even get through it all. The baby back ribs tasted OK and the fries were awesome but after about 30 minutes we both had upset stomachs. Needless to say the whole experience was a letdown (it was my first time there) and a waste of $50 dollars (which is way to expensive for a casual dinner, in my eyes).

review_471639,restaurant,"The few times I've been to Paco's, I have found the food to be underwhelming (it's not the best Tex Mex I've ever had, but it's not the worst, and it usually leaves me full and bringing home leftovers). I've had a wide variety of meals at Paco's, and it has always been the company and the margaritas that keeps me coming back, not really the food. The first time I went to Paco's, I got a taco platter, and while they were good, they weren't stand out or spectacular. I've also tried the enchiladas, but my issue with those is I'm more of an authentic kind of gal, and enchies (a very technical and affectionate term for enchiladas) made with sour cream chicken,  or topped with chili gravy don't really wow me (plus they were drowning in sauce, which after bite three made them soggy). My friend can't say enough nice things about Paco's salads (she loves the chopped salad and the Paco's salad), but the one time I went the salad route the veggies didn't seem fresh and the honey cilantro lime dressing was overpowering, and I was disappointed yet again. Yet, I could never write Paco's off (my friends loyally go and say I will find something I like), so I keep giving them more chances. A few weeks ago I was happy I didn't give up on Paco's.\n\nBy far the star of the show at Paco's is the fajitas. As I was browsing the menu to try something new yet again (my fallback was going to be to branch out at get some tacos I'd never tried) I stumbled upon the fajita platters tucked in the first page of their new menu. Paco's delivered on steak fajitas, and I was thrilled. The steak was seared to my liking and super tender. It looked beautiful; there were ample grill marks and it was simple and straightforward, which allowed its smoky flavor to shine. An abundance of vegetables accompanied the steak on the sizzling platter, and the peppers and onions melted in my mouth and burst with flavor on each bite. I tucked my precious steak and veggies into piping hot, soft flour tortillas, and topped them with traditional fixings (beans, cheese, lettuce, pico de gallo, guacamole and sour cream) before gorging myself.\n\nRead the full review here: http://offtheeatenpathblog.com/2013/08/07/pacos-tacos-and-tequilla/",2

review_101445,restaurant,"Happened to be at the mall around 6:30pm and decided to go to Z'Tejas for dinner. It was a 25 min wait. Looked across the way and saw lots of open tables at Kona Grill. That ought to have registered as a red flag but since I was starving I guess my mental acuity was off. The hostess sat us in the back of the restaurant with a clear view of the hallway leading to the restrooms. We commented to our hostess that we were awful close to the restrooms. She chirped, yeah. End of discussion. I ordered a grey goose on the rocks, you know, vodka and ice in a glass. What I got back wasn't grey goose and it was mixed with soda, but it was in a glass though. My wife ordered a rib eye sandwich, medium. What she got was still breathing. My Korean chicken was almost warm but I attribute most of that to the spices. It was good but not great. I will say that our server was terrific and the manager did come by to check on us. This used to be a good spot but seems to be going through a transition period to become mediocre. Too bad.",1
review_133838,restaurant,"It's cold here, like anywhere indoors in Vegas.  We came for a late lunch on Labor Day weekend, so it was still a little crowded even around 1pm, a 10-minute wait.  But we got a nice table by the fountains and strip club, so it was pleasing for both parties. :)\n\nThe food seemed a little 'meh', to put it best.  It was very run-of-the-mill island bar fare.  Basically their take on \""Hawaiian\"" burgers is to put bacon or avocados on everything, with a slice of pineapple on the side.  Last time I checked, that really doesn't have very much to do with the beautiful islands of Hawai'i at all.  Neither does the Buffalo Burger, which we ordered.\n\nThe burger came out medium rare, which was nice.  Although, my girlfriend did later complain about some stomach pains, which made it a tough day.\n\nThe prices here are going to be resort prices - you can get better just by walking around in Vegas, and I suggest you do, unless you're absolutely set on eating at the Miracle Mile Shops.",1

Ignore the unfortunate signage out front; inside it's comfortable, with a quirky dog-related theme. I highly recommend their kedgeree at brunch and most everything for dinner. Many dishes are served in small or large portions, so it's easy to find a meal to suit your appetite. The manager/owner/head waiter has a rather terse style, or perhaps he's just as quirky as the place he's created. He's well known around the Edinburgh culinary establishment and has, I'm told, opened rather a few excellent sites. If you get him as your waiter (he's the tall drink of water with the shiny pate), just roll with it. His suggestions will be excellent, even if his manner may come off as a bit abrupt.",3

review_189367,restaurant,"This review is for the Buffet at Wynn and not for the hotel/casino as a whole. \n\nI want to start off by saying that according to many publications and the voice of \""the people\"", the Bellagio buffet and the Wynn buffet are the most popular and highest quality buffets in Vegas. I've been to both as well as many \""lesser\"" buffets in Vegas but I'm only going to compare the Bellagio and the Wynn in this review. \n\nIn a nutshell, I like the Wynn buffet better. Quality isn't the issue, as both buffets have fresh, quality food items offered. \n\nI like the Wynn better because of space and location. At the Bellagio buffet, the layout is cramped and it feels like I'm in a Wal-Mart on Black Friday in Philly. Vegas is crowded, I get it. Even the biggest agoraphobe has to recognize and accept this. However, I don't want to deal with this when I'm trying to get my eat on. \n\nAt the Wynn, the layout  feels more spacious and the tables are spaced apart enough so that even if the place was full, you feel like you're at a table in a traditional restaurant. \n\nLocation: the Bellagio casino/hotel is more centrally located on the strip so naturally it would attract more people to their business. With this unfortunately brings some people you don't want to be around. And when I don't want to be around them normally, I certainly don't want to be around them in a buffet. Consequently, the Bellagio seems messier and dirtier when busy for the same reason. \n\nThe Wynn is located farther down the strip and most people don't feel like walking there. Relaxing and enjoying a good meal at their buffet is a reward for your exercise. \n\nI don't know, maybe I'm nuts or maybe I've been to the Bellagio when it was super busy and to the Wynn when it wasn't (dinner on a weekend should have been). \n\nI suppose I must talk about the food at least a little bit, we are after all reviewing a buffet. First off, you need to know that everything is fresh. Here is some of what was offered the last time I was there (a few weeks ago): a \""starter station\"" (the obligatory soup and salad, Italian cured meats, cheeses, baguettes with several spreads), several types of ceviches, oysters Rockefeller, an Italian section (chicken Cacciatore, various pastas, green pea risotto), an Asian section (some stir fry, some dim sum items, sushi), a roasting/oven station (with lamb, turkey, veal short ribs, lamb stew, and a traditional roast), a seafood section (shrimp, Alaskan crab legs) and finally a dessert station. That's just off the top of my head, I did not get to partake in every station. \n\nAbout the last sentence above, I know it's a nice place, but let's be real here, it's still a fucking buffet and you need to hunker down and EAT. Bring your family here, bring your wife/girlfriend/bf for a nice meal where each of you eat three small plates max but when you're ready for the pros, come alone or with a friend(s) that can put a hurt on some food. \n\nI enjoyed everything I had but what stood out for me was the lamb roast, the short ribs, and the oysters Rockerfeller. Everything was so good that I ate stuff I normally don't like or eat too much of like the roast turkey (Thanksgiving again, yay!) and sweets. Yeah, I'm a weirdo, I don't like sweets too much (not to mention if I eat too much I feel like dying). Anyway, I enjoyed the lime/coconut cups and the creme brulee, both were awesome. \n\nPrice, *meh*, If you even have the Wynn Buffet on your mind, you should be able to afford it, so don't bitch. \n\nToodles.",3

review_394395,restaurant,"Met some friends there on a Sunday during football playoff season. Since we weren't there to watch the games, the place was too loud for my taste. The lady at the table next to me, who screamed profanity every time a play happened during the game, leads me to believe this may not be the place to bring children. However, I was impressed with all their screens and would consider going back during college football season to enjoy a game there. I'd also like to try hanging out on their patio during the warmer months.\n\nOur server was pretty good, despite being very busy.\n\nWine prices seemed high for this type of pub, so I opted for a sangria, since I wasn't in the mood for a beer.\n\nThe chicken dumpling soup was good, and my fellow diner raved it reminded him of his grandmother's soup.\n\nHowever, I was extremely disappointed in my pear salad. The menu said it was served on mixed greens, but all I got was some tasteless iceberg lettuce. I should have spoken up at the time and questioned my order, but I didn't, so in Brazwell's defense, I didn't give them the opportunity to correct this blatant error.\n\nI will give them another shot, and look forward to providing an updated review at that time.",2

The service was very good  although it was restaurant week, we were able to get in and out in a timely manner. \n\nI went again last night with my brother I decided to try the vegetarian burger which came with fries, it was very good and flavorful with some fresh veggies on top and good temperature the fries were hot and fresh as well. My only complaint would be the fries were extremely salty. I used the hot sauce to tone down the salt a bit. I am a type of person that will not send food back for any reason, and we were also in a hurry. My brother ordered the Pot Roast and he stated that this was very good. We did not order drinks but I have had their drinks in the past which is a good selection of wine and beer. \n\nFor the price you get good service and food, my only suggestion would be is to not add any salt to the fries and have salt and pepper on the tables along with serving the condiments with the food so the wait staff does not have to make several tips for condiments along with not having to wait to eat your food waiting for the condiments. \n\nFor vegetarians they have the nancy'...brie, avocado, tomato and shaved red onion on garlic rubbed bread ,the dump truck salad and  the vegetarian burger.

review_379183,restaurant,"Been driving past this restaurant for awhile, but when my roommate was looking for a place to eat for dinner, we ended up here.\n\nThe restaurant wasn't very busy when we arrived at around 7:50pm on a weekday night.  Since I snacked earlier, I didn't want to try their AYCE.  I ended up ordering their Pad See Ew (Thai-style stir-fried wide noodles), which came out hot (always a plus) and was overall good tasting.  However, all the Pad See Ew I have ever ordered in the past were made with a little eggs, and gravy, which this version didn't have (which in my opinion is more like a Chinese Chow Fan and not Pad See Ew).\nMy roommate ordered the Bento Box, which seems like an excellent value.  I didn't try her dinner, but it looked delicious, and she said it was very good.\n\nService was nice and friendly, but we were not very demanding and the restaurant unfortunately was not busy at the time.\n\nIf I am in the mood for AYCE sushi and trying out a new place, I will definitely consider checking out this place in the future.",2
review_410320,restaurant,"I was in the mood for a breakfast burrito and Los Rubios that is right around the corner from my house was closed. So I went here instead. Service was fast, however the burrito was marginal at best. I ordered the 'Breakfast Burrito', which had eggs, ham and pico de gallo. I was try to eat this and drive to work. \n\nBad idea!\n\nI had some 'juice' from within the burrito running down my forearm and onto my jeans. I wasn't happy about this. So I had to fashion the paper bag around the wax paper wrap to catch said 'juice'.\n\nThe only thing from here that I can say has been consistently good would be the super nachos. After I typed the last sentence, I realized, every time I had the super nachos were after consuming copious amounts of alcohol, which could be why it was good.",1
review_289061,restaurant,"I really like this place because my pho always has alot of meat! I don't have to add anything to the broth and its always really fast! The service isn't too bad, but not good.But the pho makes up for it because it comes piping hot. Get what u pay for here.",4

review_541548,restaurant,"Quaint little place with a down home vibe.  The owners are Filipino, who have family in Hawaii, which explains why there are Filipino and Hawaiian selections on the menu. Prices are reasonable, although portions could be bigger.   Service is fast and friendly.\n\nRed velvet pancakes.  Fluffy and thick with that delicious cake flavor you would hope to have.\n\nPortuguese sausage with eggs. \nI was able to get the garlic fried rice with my sausage and eggs.  It was just white rice with very  little flavor.",2
review_5115,restaurant,"They had 3 hostess up front doing nothing and didn't even greet us. Booked reservation for 17 and she tried to cram us on 3 tables. We had no space to move elbows. Why would you even try to seat us like that? Reason I book reservation is to have enough seats ahead of time. \n\nWhen I walk up front ask host if I can get a bigger table. She gave me an attitude. And was like \""sure\"". Never got a apology for cramming us into a small table. The place is a family style with big dishes. The way they had us seated we wouldn't been able too move to grab our food. Terrible customer service and it was my birthday. Disappointment. Will never return to the restaurant.",0
review_525367,restaurant,DON'T DO BUSINESS WITH THEM. They messed up our order. Then tried to charge us for their mistake. They said 30 minutes. 1hour later food came. It was missing a whole meal. When we called they said they would send one out. Then called back and tried to charge for their mess up. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!!!!,0

review_351485,restaurant,Great place. Great food. Great Sake.\nFood selection was different. The taste was very unique too.\nPortions are Tapas style---which works out if you are not very hungry.\n\nIf you are in a mood for some fusion type cuisine---give it a shot.\n\nIt would be nice if they served hot sake---which i missed.\nOther than that---no complaints.,4

review_262731,restaurant,"I am a HUGE Sonic lover. Saddly, this is the closest to my house and MY LEAST FAVORITE SONIC!!! The service is very slow and 4/5 times the grilled cheese I order is under cooked and soggy. If I have the craving for some Sonic I try to avoid this one unless it's their happy hour and I am going strictly for a Limeaide.\n\nOne bonus to this location is they do recognize me and my coworkers... so if the drive thru is packed we park in a stall and every now and then we get food brought to us first. They have TOTALLY forgotten about us as well.... so I guess it's pretty hit and miss here.",1
review_354680,restaurant,"Maybe I'm just a little bit miserly recently, and not really in sync with inflation and the cost of life and such like, but I do find a meal plus a few glasses of wine in here fairly pricey. However, if you come to George Street to drink or dine, you have to encompass and in some ways embrace the fact that you'll be paying more than you would in other areas of the city, and if the well-to-do sophistication (mostly) of George Street is what you're looking for, then you probably won't mind spending a wee bit more money to have an upmarket culinary experience.\n\nOn the plus side, the food here is very decent, and the portions are generous too, so you aren't paying over the odds for tiny food, and you will feel like you've actually eaten. The roasted shoulder of lamb and the sea bass dish have both been enjoyed by me in the past, and the menu is quite extensive, with a range of classic, fairly traditional options. The bar section next to the restaurant is popular all week, and a pretty pleasant choice of place to drink in, and there's sometimes a live piano accompaniment to all the drinking merriment.",2
review_368037,restaurant,"I love Applebees.  Not this one.  \n\nEvery time I'm hear something gets screwed up.  I'm not kidding.  It's only this Applebees.  On the flip side, the servers are nice and I've gotten to try a lot of renditions of a bbq cheeseburger because it's always differently wrong when I go in.  \n\nThe restaurant has a nice layout and usually has whatever game on tv that should be on but the service is S-L-O-W and I think they may be doing it so we get so hungry while we nibble on our arms we order more food when they do come around.  \n\nLike I said above, I'm a huge Applebee's fan.  Just not this one.",0
review_60480,restaurant,"I would NOT recommend this place at all!! I tired the Al pastor and asada sopes. \n\nThe asada was pale looking, no color and dry. I spit out half the meat because it was fat I was chewing on.\n\nThe Al pastor was mushy and overly seasoned.\n\nThe sopes portion was burnt and had chunks of corn it in which made it taste sweet.. not a fan at all.\n\nThe toppings on the sopes consisted of the fake prepackaged shredded cheese. Tasted like I had watered down American sour cream. The beans did not taste fresh and out of a rosarita can. \n\nTo drink I had the horchata.. tasted watered down and not homemade. Def came from a package.\n\nThis place was worse than Robertos. And if you've ate there you know it is just as far from authentic as taco bell.",0

review_58237,restaurant,"The food wasn't very memorable. My mom's peanut chicken and tofu wasn't super temperature hot, and my curry wasn't very spice hot, but both had good enough flavor. I was trying to find some new Thai in the area since I feel Penn's has gone downhill in quality and uphill in price. This place didnt seal the deal for me. \n\nLunch specials were decently priced, and service was alright. Probably wouldn't go back on my Thai food quest.",2
review_463758,restaurant,"Prices increase by $.25 per item after 9pm.. Sounds fishy.\n\nBBQ Pork Bun: Slightly above average. Seemed fresh, the dough was still fluffy and not at all glue-y (you know what I mean). There was a decent amount of meat in it as well. Solid- would order again.\n\nBBQ Pork & Grilled Pork Sandwiches: I felt like there was very little meat on our sandwiches, piled high with the veggie fixings. We ate them, but meanwhile discussed how we should have gone to Hue Thai for that mouthwatering pork sandwich we got there last time. \n\nThe sodas here always have a strange taste. I'm not sure why that it, it almost tastes plastic-y. \n\nAll in all, we might pop by for the occasional pork bun (until I can find a better one elsewhere) but will be taking the rest of our sandwich money over to Hue Thai.",1

review_346541,restaurant,"Good energy, fine menu, earnest servers.\nHowever...\nAs evidenced by the steam that poured out when I cut it open, my salmon spent too much time under the heat lamp (I had asked for it to be medium-rare, while another in our arty wanted his well-done), so I told our server immediately, who graciously offered another. This one came out, literally and totally raw in the center. Though I like my food on the under-done side, this was disgusting. It felt like a \""gotcha\"" from the kitchen; wholly uncalled-for, and it felt very insulting. Not to mention inedible. I flagged down our server, who of course apologized profusely (it was not her fault). She took it away. Time passed (a lot). I ordered dessert. Our server said she would \""comp\"" it to make up for the salmon fiasco. 15 minutes later we told her we just needed our bill as it was now 6:40 and we needed to get to the Herberger.\nSo all in all, it was a pretty disappointing experience.\n\nAnd their website doesn't provide any way to email them directly:  uncool.",1
review_287050,restaurant,"Earlier this week, we used our handy Google mobile app to locate what we hoped was authentic Mexican food. We were craving flavorful salsa and well-spiced meat dishes after a long, warm day in the desert. What we found here was slightly different than we were expecting......The chips were made of corn AND flour tortillas, which was a nice surprise but way too filling while waiting for our food. The salsa was just fresh tomatoes with some cilantro (or maybe even parsley?) for color.\nIt was \""Taco Tuesday\"", which here meant all-you-can-eat of crunchy or soft with 3 different filling choices.\""Hamburger Helper-esque flavored shredded beef tacos\"", according to my teen son. Ooops :( I ordered the \""award-winning green chili sweet tamale\"". I fear they left the winners with the judges, for they didn't make it to my table. The tamales were dry and contained about a tablespoon of chopped chiles throughout. And, although they were sweet as promised, they lacked depth of flavour overall.\nThe service was fine and the refills on soft drinks was fair, but I really was hoping for more. We are in town for a couple of weeks and may try it one more time since it's close to our accommodations, but with all these Tex-Mex and MexiCali flavour houses to choose from, it will take a lot to win us over for a better review.",1
review_287203,restaurant,"Good gracious. There's no other eatery on the strip that can flip the 'state of death' that a night on Vegas can leave you in.  Sometimes I lie awake in my room.... dreaming of the day the Earl graces Los Angeles with his presence. Maybe its for the better, seeing as I prefer to not be morbidly obese. But hey, there are worse evils.\n\nTo the food! Onward!  Word to the wise- go with other people... that way you can steal, i mean, taste, each sandwich.  I've tried every type, and have yet to cross a sandwich I didn't like. It just kinda depends on what you're in the mood for.\n\nAnd ladies, if, for some gawd awful reason, you are watching your figure.... try the kids turkey. So cheesy and 50% less guilt per serving.",3
review_504084,restaurant,"I've only had the food from here once and it was delivery.  I like how delivery is online, that is great for me.  The green beans with garlic that I heard so much about was good but they were ice cold (on purpose).  I didn't dig that so much.  The flavor was good though, a little greasy but good.  The general tso's chicken was super good and I felt good after eating it.  It's okay.  I would consider eating there again in house since I hear so many good things about it.",2

Mostly burgers that come with greasy homemade chips or of course fries.  Sorry, but had enough fries this short vaca to last 6 months.  Lots of beers of course.  A quaint place. I got the $7.00 pierogee appetizer.  Only 3.  Really?  These are a cheap item.  Might be a  $5 item. Had more of them in Philly for less $.",2

review_366361,restaurant,"What can be said about In & Out, doesn't matter which location perfectly consistent every single time.

review_360337,restaurant,"I only went here once.  That one time was pretty nice though.  A lot of people here have been giving them no stars because of a towing issue, or because their business hours are not amazing... This is unfair.

review_639664,restaurant,"I have never seen a Gyro restaurant in a shopping mall's court yard before... so of course I ate here! I ordered the Gyro Burger and noticed a tray of baklava (naturally, I ordered one of those as well). Now, the only problem I had with Gyro Express was that I didn't feel like my food came in an 'express'-like manner. It was slow and in a food court... slow is BAD! But, I saw them cut meat off the roast, so I know my meal was fresh to order (is that the correct phrase?). The only other place in that food court that takes a while to complete your order is Steak Escape.\n\nThe Gyro Burger was outstanding, if I wasn't in a hurry... I'd say it was 'worth the wait.' Now, that baklava... that was AH-Mazing! It was a huge piece, first of all. It was delicious, second of all. And third of all, the pastry portion was flaky. It may have been the best baklava I've ever had and will definitely entice me to stop back for more (even if that ends up being the only reason... a craving for baklava).",3
review_264564,restaurant,"Joe's is located inside of Caesars and oh man was it a find. The restaurant first originated in Florida where stone crab is abundant and eventually opened offshoots in DC, Chicago and Vegas. The prices are on the high side but the quality of the seafood more than makes up for the sticker shock. I went to this restaurant a few years back and I still remember how amazing it was.\n\nThe food:\n\nStone Crab Claws- this is the dish that put the restaurant on the map. The stone claws are amazing, the flavors of the crab are wonderful and the amount of meat you gets is adequate. The honey mustard dipping sauce is the perfect pairing to the crab. The sauce is not too aggressive nor too sweet. This is a must order.\n\nBacon- Wrapped Sea Scallops- this is probably the best scallop dish I ever had. The scallops were huge and cooked to perfection. The scallops are clustered together then wrapped on the outside with bacon. There were two clusters given and it was more than filling. This is a must order.\n\nCrab stuffed Sole with lobster sauce- I thought this was a good dish. The sole was cooked nicely, it was moist and tender. The lobster sauce, which resembled lobster bisque, was a nice accompaniment. The crab meat while present, wasn't a major factor.\n\nKey Lime pie- their key lime pie is wonderful. It has a nice tart flavor and a nice crunchy bottom.",4

It seemed though that I didn't get very many fries in the basket. The root beer float was yummy as always too.",2
review_343618,restaurant,"Had better buffets! Luckily this was free! My friend got a coupon in the mail and he invited me to come, my guess it is Hawaiian nite, being that there were many Hawaiian dishes, food was just okay but the most worrisome thing was that there are no dedicated serving utensils for each dish, and you have to use the same utensil for serving multiple items, I have a allergy to shrimp, and at the pasta area, the lady used the same spoon to ladle each ingredient, they have shrimp and clams to make pasta and the same spoon was used for garlic, cheese, onions etc , I told her I had allergies and she said it was fine, and continued making my dish, after 1 taste my mouth became itchy and irratated! My allergy is not as bad as some people's , so I have to wonder how many people they have injured or made sick due to this lack of basic food safety techniques??? If u have any allergies I would highly recommend staying away from here! Such a shame, you can tell they spent alot of money on decor ,because it is very nicely decorated but , I think they should have spent the money teaching their employees basic food safety !!

We all shared it.\n\nMy friend wasn't crazy about her crabcakes.  Everyone else at the table loved their meal.  The salads were beautiful and fresh.\n\nOur waitress was excellent and we were sat immediately (we had a reservation) upon arrival.\n\nMy only complaint was that Opentable emailed me to ask why I didn't show up for my reservation - which I had.  Ah well.",4
review_641221,restaurant,"Went for the pesto chicken sandwich today. It was good. Not a fan of the almonds in it though, but you can't do without them on this sandwich. I honestly think the best thing on their menu is the creme brulees. I had the mixed berry and caramel on two separate occasions and they were to die for. The sandwiches are nothing special. I came back and had another crab avocado sandwich and it was okay. I think I liked it so much the first time because it was new.I wouldn't go out of my way to recommend a sandwich here, because they're nothing spectacular. However, they ARE tasty and the atmosphere of this place is cool. I'll come back I'm sure.",2

review_100240,restaurant,I visited this place 2 years ago and never wanted to come back. Just recently I stopped by and noticed the owners changed. They are so polite and the bagels are great for the price! I went back for the 2nd time today and they've re-did the inside there is much more room. I had a bagel sandwich and an ice mocha coffee that is easily comparable to Dutch Brothers but half the price. If you haven't been to Bagel Nosh in a while I recommend trying them again!,4

They became very distracted and service suffered. Finally our waitress took our order, tuna tartare, tilapia, meatballs and stuffed mushrooms, 3 out 4 showed up, waitress never came by to check on us only to ask if wanted dessert.

review_481998,restaurant,"The concept of a seasonal menu is great, especially at Seasons 52 where they have a weekly seasonal specials menu that changes each week, hence the 52 in the name. Also each menu item is suppose to be portion-size appropriate and 475 cal or less. Sure butter and olive oil make food taste good, but it's nice to eat this and know that healthy meals can be made incredible tasty without the added cooking fat. \n\nWe started by sharing the goat cheese ravioli appetizer and a salad with arugula, roasted beets and almonds.  Their drink menu is pretty impressive too with many wine and beer options and mixed cocktails. \n\nFor our main entrees I got the scallops and my man got the trout. Both were delicious. We finished the meal with a sampling of their mini indulgences desserts, which are served in a shot glass. P.F. Chang's does this too and it's a nice idea. You get a little something sweet but it's not this huge heavy dessert at the end. \n\nOur server Stephanie was very nice. She also took the white bean soup off our bill without any problems when we realized upon arrival to our table that it was cooked with ham (which we don't eat and it wasn't mentioned on the menu). \n\nNice decor inside too, slightly rustic-contemporary and a nice open floor plan. Oh, and they validate parking too, since you have to pay in the lot out front.  Thanks!",4
