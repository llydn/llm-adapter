review_531858,restaurant,"Had the vegan burger, the patty fell apart, and that happens sometimes with veggie patties, but it also lacked flavor.  The fat fries were good but not exceptional.The husband had the margarita pizza it was nice and thin but also lacked seasoning. Next time I'll try something else, I'm not willing to give up on this place yet.",2
review_532026,restaurant,"As I drove by Caffe Mona looking for a parking spot, (good luck. parking is on the street only) I seriously considered turning around and canceling my brunch plans. Wow. This place is a little frightening from the outside. However, when I was able to find a spot at a nearby meter, I cautious walked in and took a huge sigh of relief. The inside is quaint but charming. A few tables inside and looks like a deck with tables outside in nice weather. Although I was drawn to Caffe Mona because of the prix fixed menu, I decided that I really wanted to try the Elvis (crepes with peanut butter, bananas & bacon) and I thought that a third course of a sweet crepes might be a little much. In addition to my Elvis, I ordered a fruit plate for an app. I was rather disappointed in the fruit plate. I understand that most fruits are not in season in late March but I was expecting a little more than just apples, bananas and white grapes. It was not pleasing to the eye. Also to note, my plate was significantly larger than my two dinning companions who ordered the fruit plate as their first course with the prix fixed menu. A few minutes later, I was presented with the glory that was the Elvis. I can still taste the sweetness of the syrup and bananas perfectly complimented by the saltiness of the crisp bacon. I sat back and enjoyed every last bite while the girls were presented with their third course, a crepe with strawbery jam. In conclusion, don't judge a book by its cover. Although Caffe Mona looks rough and tumble from the outside, the food, atmosphere and decor are well worth the fight to find parking.",3
review_410911,restaurant,"Came in with my mother-in-law and daughter.  They ordered the chicken pot and broccoli casserole.  I ordered the lasagna.  I had a few bites of their pot pies, best pot pie ever.  Crust was very flaky n tasty, filling had a lot chicken.  Lasagna was really good also.  Service was excellent.  We will definitely be back.",4
review_535651,restaurant,"My boyfriend introduced me to this place a few months ago, and it is the best.  The curry dishes are amazing.  Service is great they know our order by heart.  Tucked away in a random strip mall in Goodyear you would never know it was here.  Do yourself a favor and check this place out.",4
review_115478,restaurant,"Ever since Dominos changed up their recipe/ingredients, their pizza has really been awesome. I enjoy the thin crust with spinach, tomatoes, and mushrooms.  Mmmm",2
review_471203,restaurant,"Alright, y'all. This place is UNDER NEW MANAGEMENT as of three days ago. That means, new menu, new food preparation, new prices.\n\nSoggy rice (that was JUST put out), poor execution of tradition dishes, and the price. Wow. $12 for a lunch buffet with only ten poorly executed options (although I can't speak for the two meat dishes).\n\nI try not to be super negative when writing reviews but, it seems like a good warning to those who look up where in University City to eat and see almost four stars across the board for a place that doesn't have the same menu any more.",1
review_240412,restaurant,"The best BBQ in all of AZ! Try them, you'll love them!",4
review_150225,restaurant,"Came for brunch - had the Soy Sausage Benedict and Crab Omelete. Both were really good, especially the benedict which was made with Corn Bread instead of an English Muffin. Was awesome!",3
review_25709,restaurant,It's good but not as good as the Ray's located on Greenway. Which is some of the best Pizza in the Valley.,2
review_434834,restaurant,Love the new salads.,4
review_9205,restaurant,"Two things hit me when I walked in here.  The decor and the delicious smell.  First off the elaborate wood carvings and other ornate decorations really set the mood for a good meal.  Then there was the food itself.  It was actually pretty good, even though I'm not usually a big fan of food with a lot of spice. But if that's your thing go for it.  I had a lot of fun here, and I'll certainly be back to try some more.",3
review_394987,restaurant,"One question: how do places like this stay in business?  My son had the \""beef curry,\"" which was a plate of onions and a few bits of cow gristle.  My pad Thai was soupy and bland, like watery EasyMac.  So-so service, airport-waiting area ambiance... need I say more? Yuck!",0
review_71947,restaurant,"After driving by so many times I finally decided to give Papa Murphy's a try.  I assumed it would be cheap since it was a take-and-bake joint and that it would be doubly cheap with a coupon I got for signing up for their emails.  You know what they say happens when you assume, right?\n\nSo anyways, I think we paid around $10 for a pizza that wasn't even cooked.  Ten bucks might have been fair since it was a little larger than, say, Papa Johns or Pizza Hut pizzas- but it didn't even taste that great.  It wasn't bad by any means but it was definitely forgettable.\n\nThey did have very nice employees and at least they weren't cheap on the toppings.  But the next time I'm lazy and in the mood for a pizza, I'll just call up one of the chains and get one ready to go for $10.",1
review_537469,restaurant,"The food was nothing to write home about, but the Breakfast Club is a conveniently located option for anyone attending a conference or staying at a hotel nearby. Service was quick and good.\n\nMy Bloody Mary ($7) was too salty and too watery. I didn't finish it, which says something. My mushroom omelette ($10) tasted like standard diner fare, but I was happy they used shiitake and oyster mushrooms rather than just button or cremini.",2
review_350112,restaurant,"The ambiance of Cafe Monarch is a 5 but we were really disappointed with the food.  I had the filet which by itself was flavorless.  The sauce was really good but it was necessary to mask the bland over cooked filet.  I ordered it medium rare and it was delivered medium well. My husband had the cannelloni and he said it was fair.  The cauliflower soup was good, salad fair and the dessert fantastic. We ordered the scallops and asked if that would be too much food. Our server said no and of course it was too much. Perhaps this was a bad night. The wait staff was attentive.",2
review_528938,restaurant,"I gave this a 1 star because this is open all nite which is convenient. However the food is AWFUL. We had a chili dog and I am sure the can chili tastes 100% better! I come to Vegas quite a bit and our hotel is close to this place. Food is AWFUL. Even though we spent over the minimum required,waitress asked us to pay in cash... won't EVER go there again...",0
review_534391,restaurant,"Cute little cafe that is close to home and was very good!  My husband and I decided to try it for breakfast, we had heard about their version of red velvet pancakes and thought it might be good.\n\nThe service was great, but then there was only one other table.  We got the red velvet pancakes and the lemon ricotta pancakes.  I love the idea of a sweet cream cheese frosting.  I do agree with my husband, the lemon ricotta needed a little bit more lemon flavor but overall, it was good.\n\nThe menu is simple and has some interesting lunch items.  I think it's worth a trip back to check it out.",3
review_496777,restaurant,"The servers are nice and the presentation of the food was fairly sophisticated, but the actual taste of the food was disappointing. We ordered a large veriety of things and to be honest none of it was good at all. I suggest going to dinner elsewhere and just ordering drinks/desert at Tanzy aka iPics.",1
review_614721,restaurant,I so wanted this place to be good. But the food is mediocre. Don't get me wrong the place has really nice decor and atmosphere. But the food was a disappointment. We had the chicken wings which were a bit sweet for our taste then had the bulgogi burger which was also a bit too sweet the bun was kind of hard and didn't taste fresh came with potato chips as well (seriously thats the best thing you can come up with! they were stale anyways!) also has another 2 dishes which I can't remember what they were obviously also mediocre since I can't remember what they were. Service was ok. Overall an average experience. Don't think I would go back.,2
review_562009,restaurant,"Terrible service always .... They don't know how to make a medium rare burger and the owner ,Joe walks around like he cares ...total phoney ....",0
review_515416,restaurant,"I gave them 3 stars because their vegan dessert was delicious and we got decent service. I loved the vegan red velvet cake. But be warned that the entrees are way overpriced for what they are. I couldn't believe the price when our server brought us the bill, and we didn't even eat half of our food because it was so mediocre. If your thinking about coming here, just stop by for dessert!",2
review_272576,restaurant,"WOW!!! Love this place!! I serve in a local restaurant and actually tell my customers about this place. My daughter and I try to go at least once a week! Not only is the crawfish fabulous but they have the freshest oysters i have ever eaten! Always happy and unpretentious servers that are attentive, always keeping my drink filled. I will keep wrestling with the dilemma of spreading the word of this place but afraid that too many people that know about it will ruin it. Last time i was there i overheard a couple of ignorant patrons complaining, obviously they have no idea what good taste is. Can't fix unsophisticated taste palates. Let them eat elsewhere, perhaps a hamburger chain. We will continue to patronize as long as they are open!!!",4
review_383880,restaurant,"Went here Thursday night for dinner. My family ordered the family feast and substituted cole slaw for Mac n cheese. The waitress forgot to bring my fathers code to the tableland we had to request it after 10minutes. The food arrived and the corn was overlooked, the fries were cold and the meat was mediocre at best. I would only recommend this place if you like poor service and have no taste buds.",0
review_590616,restaurant,"Service was disorganized and extremely slow. They made up for it with free drinks and ice cream, but we were left with a bad taste in out moths mouth when the manager insulted me to my face and proceeded to talk about inappropriate things on the way out of the restaurant. I won't be going back here.",1
review_106024,restaurant,"Forget the lettuce for my to go lettuce wraps once, shame on you. Forget them twice, shame on me. The third time and Pei Wei is officially dead to me. Awful service and I was promised a credit for my jacked up un-lettuce wraps that has yet to happen. And I tried to call. Three times. And all three times some airhead hung up on me. Unacceptable. Stay away!",1
review_633669,restaurant,"Persuasion is a hidden gem.  Chi has great food suggestions and his dad can whip up some amazing authentic pho.  I've suggested Persuasion to many friends and all have had wonderful experiences.  The food itself is delicious but, the people make it great.  Stop in for a bite, you will not be disappointed.",4
review_334447,restaurant,"Decent food in an indecent neighborhood!\n\nI kid, I kid...the food wasn't that decent.  No, seriously, the food was fine. Nothing special but at least it didn't taste like Chef Boyardee.  Service was fairly slow and getting a drink was a process.  Were they trying to make sure we were dehydrated or something?\n\nMy pasta was tasty and I do have to say the portion was so large I couldn't finish it.\n\nIt's a solid place if you're looking for some red sauce while checking out the Village in Montreal.",2
review_530720,restaurant,"Highly Overrated!!  If you are asking if it's the best Chinese in the immediate surrounding area...then yes, it's the best Chinese food. Sure, it's better than Wangs, and the place over in the Kyrene and Ray strip mall but it's not better than Gold Chef. \n\nFor one thing, the spring rolls are reheated frozen spring rolls; it's obvious! Pretty bush league if you ask me...especially for a restaurant that people are giving 5 stars to; they were mushy and cold as if they were reheated. There are no egg rolls on the menu and while some of you may respond by saying it's not a Cantonese restaurant...my response to that is...they offer other Cantonese items so why didn't you offer egg rolls too. I know a frozen spring roll like the back of my hand. The food also lacks seasoning. The flavors are good but it could be better. For a Szechwan restaurant, the food was lacking in heat and flavor. While it's good, it's also underseasoned. The fried rice is lacking flavor. When my wife had to apply Sriracha to her Szechwan style Chinese food...that's a bad sign!\n\nBut I will say this dishes are prepared well. You don't see any of the pale watery chicken dishes that you observe at most other \""good Chinese restaurants\"" that you witness in the Valley. If you live in the immediate area, you will not be disappointed getting carry out but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here.",2
review_220223,restaurant,"Yum!  We met a couple friends at the Vig for their new Monday $5 burger and fries special - what a steal!  Add that to great happy hour specials and you've got a night out on a budget!\n\nI started with the lemonade while everyone else had a beer, and my husband was happy to see the Dogfish 90 minute on the menu. \n\nFor dinner, I went with the greek salad with a side of sweet potato fries (of course!).  The greek salad was huge and came with some pita bread, so this was definitely a great choice for an entree.  The sweet potato fries were delicious, but I was not a fan of the yellow dipping sauce they came with.  What even was that?  No one could figure it out.  The boys loved their burgers and fries.  Definitely big portions!  \n\nOur service was so-so, but nobody seemed to mind.  It allowed us plenty of time to chat and just relax, which was nice.  \n\nI wish there were more choices like this in Chandler!  Until then, we'll definitely take the trek back to the Vig, especially when it gets cooler and we can take advantage of the patio.",3
review_276740,restaurant,"Ive been \""dragged\"" here twice. Im really surprised it has so many good reviews, but then again, people love crappy food. Fast food and chain restaurants are recession-proof. This place reminds me of chuckee cheese. I think the food is horrible, but its always crowded, mostly with people with tons of kids. The service is unspeakable, even if you have lowered expectations for a pizza place. Very dirty feel of the place. It smells like sewer inside, like that dirty steaming floor drain smell. The servers run around with dirty plates, money and fresh food all in one round, just throwing dirty plates in bus-tubs, and walking around. They serve 12 beers on tap, and red and white wine. The bartender was so incompetent it was embarrassing to even watch.  She was so awful, I cringed.",0
review_555790,restaurant,Amazing food! Strange location with just enough ambiance to feel like it's worth the prices. Our server was knowledgable and friendly though she could have been a bit more proactive in making recommendations to some people who were clearly in over their head. I loved everything I had but the pork belly and crispy pig's ears stand out as clear favorites. I wish I was rich so that I could dine here regularly!,4
review_117148,restaurant,"One of my favorite places!\n\nI have a confession though... I'm a trivia addict.  So any restaurant or bar that has the Buzztime trivia automatically gets an extra start in my book... but for some reason this is where I like to play more than anywhere else.  I usually hang out in the bar/off track betting area, playing trivia and once in a while betting on the horses or dogs (with miserable results, I hate to add.)\n\nOne of my favorite sandwiches in the Valley is here - I love their Buffalo Chicken.  It's huge and covered in a pretty hot yet flavorful buffalo sauce. Unlike most places where it's not hot enough... oh and they let me choose the heat level.  Wings are really great here as well.\n\nNow I'm wanting to get back over there for a beer, buffalo chicken and gave of trivia... Too bad it's only Thursday.  \n\nCons: If you are a young single man looking to go out and meet someone, avoid this place at all costs. Also only a few microbrews, and not a lot of choice of beers on tap.",3
review_336658,restaurant,"the outdoor seating is empty and they won't seat us there... they just want everyone to sit inside and uses the outside to entice customers to come in... we ate here but since it was so unmemorable, it probably was just so so and we won't be back!",0
review_630690,restaurant,"Love coming here! Great club sandwich, and the coupon deals they send in the mail for buy 2 meals for 14.99 can't be beat!",4
review_424179,restaurant,"so good!!! went there yesterday with my friend. he got the chili dog..his favorite, and i got a duck confit taco. wow, was that taco amazing! the flavors were incredible, and for $5 it was pretty nice portion of food. i am amazed at the stuff kevin sousa does. big fan of his. last time i was there i tried the fries. so crispy and fresh. i have not tried the poutine yet, but the cheese curds on the chili dog are awesome, so i'm going to go ahead and say the poutine is probably also awesome. yay! :-)",4
review_241266,restaurant,Old owners are back so I thought I would try it again. Same lousy food. I picked up the food to go and it was already cold. The tacos had so much grease dripping from them I collected it to change my car oil. SO needles to say I am done with them!,0
review_91649,restaurant,"Met Hubby here today for one of our last lunches together for the summer. It's the place he (and just about every other state employee, it seems) eats most often. It's a tiny little shop with a few tables crammed in and a mistered patio out back. The walls are lined with AZ memorabilia, license plates, and old timey signs. But for once, they're for real, not the fake old timey stuff that's on the walls of most chain restaurants. I'm lookin' at you, Cracker Barrel....\n\nThey have a great variety of subs, plus soups, salads, fruit bowls, a veritable wall o'chips, and baskets of sweet snax. Get the Rice Krispie treat. You know you wanna. The subs were quite good- and huge. Had I known how big, I would absolutely have ordered a half. Tons of fresh veggies, lite on the mayo, a tad heavy on the dressing. Dallas is right- the ice is awesome. It's the perfect crush, so that, according to my husband, he can keep on chewing it long after he gets back to his desk and NOT annoy the crap out of his fellow cubies.",3
review_261571,restaurant,"It was gross, filthy - most disgusting bathrooms I've seen in Vegas.  Food was swimming in grease.\n\nThe worst part - I got sick my wife got sick and after coming home and speaking to a friend who was sick said she had eaten there too just before she got sick.\n\nBy far the worst Denny's restaurant I've stepped foot in.\n\nDon't go there.",0
review_567196,restaurant,"Their penne pasta is cooked just the way I like it. My best friend and I were trying to describe it the next morning and the only words to come out of our mouths (and at the same time) was \""AL DENTE!!!\""\n\nWe also got the bianca pizza which was really great. It's thin crust and you can taste each and every ingredient (prosciutto, arugula, etc). The spaghetti and meatballs wasn't my fave but my friends really liked the meatballs. \n\nMy friends and I went to Vegas twice in 3 months and came here both times after XS. Overpriced for what you get but it's Vegas. The close proximity makes up for it (although it doesn't feel so close by the end of the night when you're dying in your heels)!",3
review_334262,restaurant,"First stop on Montreal visit.  This was a really fantastic place.  We booked through opentable, no problems, got seated after a 10 min wait, since they were really packed.  The tables are a bit on the cramped side, but the entire place is very charmingly decorated and felt comfy and friendly.  We had a very friendly waiter, who pegged us as the leisurely tourist, so let us be, but still well cared for and not letting us feel neglected at all.\n\nWe were seated right up at the stage, which is not our first choice, but unavoidable because it was full.  Not a big problem, just a personal preference, and the trio that played that night was quite good and not too loud at all. \n\nThe food was just delicious.  I had the BEST lamb chops, perfectly done and so tender.   Well seasoned, with potatoes and grilled-just-right veggies.  Hubby had the fish, which was excellent as well.  Well paired with an excellent bottle of red recommended by the waiter who didn't try to upsell us.  Topped off by a very yummy piece of tiramisu.\n\nWe had an excellent romantic night out, well chosen.  Great start to the rest of the trip.",4
review_638848,restaurant,"New fast casual dining spot, that let's you choose what goes on your plate. Healthy eating can be a snap by dining here and the flavors have so much to offer in the way of zip and zing. Falafel, baba ghanoush, tabouli, gyro, shawarma and  soups all ready to go when you hit the line. Stop in and give it a  try their customer service is stellar!",3
review_3409,restaurant,"First time here, mid afternoon so I had the place to myself. Given the condition of most oriental restaurants this one was spot on...more on that later. \nFriendly staff, funky atmosphere and patina, good chow at dirt cheap prices. Since funky and offbeat doesn't normally have a negative effect on the food coming out of the back I don't ding them. \nHowever, my trained nose picked up the odor of roach crap. Not strong, but there and it didn't make me bolt. Smell test is one of my criteria and usually I get a phone call and walk out, but I obviously gutted it out and was happy with the outcome. Use your own judgement. As for me I will return for the authenticity.",2
review_409261,restaurant,"I'm not a big fan of Italian food, but I was craving pasta and pesto and my daughter wanted mac n'cheese.  I'd driven by Babbo many times so figured we'd try it.  Home run!  The bread they bring to the table was fabulous!  Nice start.  The staff was very nice and quick.  My daughter loved her mac n'cheese and I had a tasty steak and pesto dish.  The noodles were a little al dente - and I'm a mushy pasta girl.  The steak was tasty, the pesto was quite good and I had adequate garlic breath when I left!\n\nI will go back to try something else there - their menu was quite large and had some interesting appetizers and dishes.  And their wine list looked nice too!",2
review_96935,restaurant,A little old lady back in the kitchen working Latin magic while her little old man counterpart runs the front... yes please. The yucca frita will change your life! Authentic and wonderful. This place is a great find.,4
review_213121,restaurant,"On Sunday I met up with some friends to have lunch there at around 3:00. Others in our party ordered burgers and really seemed to enjoy them. The portions are large. Fries were ordered for the table. They were delicious, both the sweet potato and regular fries were golden, crispy and hot. I tasted someone's onion rings which were very good. \n\nOne of the dipping sauces served with the fries was a sweet sauce that is a cross between BBQ sauce and ketchup. It was the best part of my meal! Some in our party ordered cups of chili. Their cup size is very large.\n\nI ordered the fish tacos. Big mistake!  The fish was on a nondescript, limp flour tortilla, on a few pieces of shredded, wilted lettuce. I wonder who told the chef that wasabi should go on fish tacos? The fish, although battered and fried adequately, was unseasoned. I thought maybe they didn't season it because it was on a fish taco so I tried someone's fish from their fish and chips order. That fish was also unseasoned and tasteless. \n\nAlso the staff seemed to be having problems taking our orders in a timely manner. There were 8 in our party and it was a bit difficult flagging down waitresses and getting our drinks. They weren't even very busy that day. Prices are reasonable.",1
review_263903,restaurant,"Went to Rocco's last night to get my \""The Everything\"" fix (a totally loaded deluxe pizza). And it was soooo good. Crisp bottom, yeasty crust, and terrific toppings.\n\nOut of curiosity, I asked the manager about the other Rocco's deli on Buffalo. She told me that Rocco sold that location and moved his business over to W. Charleston location. So the real Rocco is in the house here, folks!\n\nAlso, she told me they are currently debuting discounted daily pasta specials everyday not to mention on Monday night their  cheese pizza is $9.99. Sweet!",3
review_182476,restaurant,"Good food, but sneaky waiter. The food was pretty good, but the service left a bad taste in my mouth. We ordered an appetizer, side, and two entrees. After ordering our entrees, the waiter asked these three words, \""Soup or Salad?\"" The question seemed to imply that either would be included with the entree. We smiled and both chose soup and were greeted at the night's end with a charge of two bowls of soup. Wonderful.  \n\nUpon receiving the bill, I asked the waiter, who we will call 'Trey', why we were charged for the soups. He said, that he asked Soup or Salad for our benefit, because it's his job as the server to make it easier for us to decide. Hmm...since when did this place begin employing used car salesmen? Sorry Trey, but I had to stiff you on the tip, because of what you did.\n\nI guess we should've smelled something 'fishy' when we first arrived. Our original plan was to dine in the top floor at the 'fine dining' portion of the restaurant and order two 5 course prix-fixe for $95 each, which is currently advertised on RM Seafood's website. When we arrived and were given menus, the lowest priced option was a 3-course for $115. The waiter said that, it was probably an outdated special from when they first opened. False advertising....  \n \nPlease watch out for hidden fees, cause these people are sneaky. The water is $5. Just from sitting in the 'fine dining' section for a few minutes, we could tell that the place was extremely old fashioned, stodgy, and cold.",0
review_371273,restaurant,"Across the street from where I'm staying, so I find myself here often out of convenience.\n\nPros: Tasty, new spins on vaguely French-by-way-of-America foods. Ridiculously oversized bakery items in window. Morning buns are epic. Pleasant live piano music sometimes. Cozy eclectic decor.\n\nCons: Overpriced, you can find just as good baked items for less in this city, not to mention meals. They have a draconian policy on cell phones and tablets, which is understandable in what they're trying to achieve, but they're annoyingly strict - more than once, I walk away because I forget their policy and just want to read a book on my tablet. Comes off as condescending and technophobic.",2
review_516685,restaurant,"Farley's Pizzeria in University City (Arbors) is fantastic. I've never ordered delivery because I live around the corner. Ordering online for pickup is super quick and easy. My order is always hot, right and ready. Delicious pizza and strombolis. The pizza crust is especially tasty.",4
review_634769,restaurant,"Hold the dirty sauce & the sourdough. Okay, let me explain. So I went with the wife and we got two different sandwiches. I got the Bear Hug on sourdough and she got the Thunderbird on the dutch-crunch. The Thunderbird comes with thunderbird sauce. It is so good, you could taste all the parts; pastrami, gouda, & thunderbird sauce. The thunderbird sauce has a little kick to it, which is why I prefer it. And now let us discuss the dutch-crunch bread, it is a little sweet so the thunderbird sauce goes on that sandwich in perfect harmony. \n\nThen we get to my sandwich. :-( The sourdough was great and I am sure the dirry-sauce is good (I had already got blown away by the thunderbird sauce) but the sandwich has way to much going on in it. Roast beef, jalapeno poppers, lettuce, & some other yummy stuff in there I can't even remember. \n\nBecause they will pretty much make any kind of sandwich you want, I want to try meatball, gouda, lettuce, with thunderbird sauce on dutch-crunch bread. I believe it will be \""out of this world\"". In fact Ike, here's a new sandwich and title for you.\n\nOne sandwich can pretty much fill two normal appetites up. Unless you are like me, a ravenous creature. Get one and share ot get one for two-three meals. \n\nThis place is overwhelming, but a must. The staff is great two. Be patient when ordering, certain orders require them to go in the back and yell an order to a cook. Remeber hundreds have survived this, there is no reason why you can't.",4
review_397754,drinks,"Holy smokes. If your here for drinks, and to get saucey- then go on in. Dont mind girl dancing on the bar above your head. BUT- Do NOT eat the food!! :-/",1
review_541411,drinks,"Our server was so slow, good thing we had a long layover. Server brought wrong drink and my fiance ordered an appetizer as his meal which came out before my salad.  Other servers looked like they had it together though.   At least the food was better than the stock car cafes looked.",1
review_187528,drinks,"A good place to go if you aren't really into clubs/don't want to wait in a line/don't want to pay admission. They have a live band playing there that plays a good variety of music that appeals to everyone.\n\nTheir frozen margaritas are WAY too sugary for my taste. After two I felt disgusting. Their volcano nachos are ridiculously huge but good to share with a huge group. \n\nI considered this place my \""back up plan\"" I wouldn't plan to go here first but if all my other plans fell awry I would be happy here.",3
review_111882,drinks,"Philly's is a great spot if you want to kick back with some good bar food and drinks.  I used to live in the apartments behind Philly's and would wall myself on over to post up at the bar.  Perfect.  Now I have moved further up into Scottsdale and still find myself posting up here.\n\nThey have a nice patio with the outside bar, TV's and of course misters!  The bartenders are always friendly and quick with service.  As far as food goes they actually have some pretty delicious bar food! Mozzarella sticks, potato skins, loaded fries, and the yummy wings!  They have that yummy creamy ranch that you could swish in your mouth.  Okay, that's a little overkill but it's really good. :)\n\nThey have good drink specials and if your order something that's not on special they will make a suggestion for what is (ie. Captain n' Coke, Sailor Jerry's n' Coke).  Everyone should appreciate that !\n\nDon't pass this place up.  Especially if you like watching sports at the bar, it's worth going here.  Don't expect anything fancy though, it is a laid back bar so plan to just enjoy yourself with friends or alone at the bar is fine too.",3
review_299378,drinks,Happy hour makes this a good find.  They have a big margarita for six bucks.  Not bad.  Good flavor definitely not watered down.\n\nI gravitate towards the Jack Daniels menu items.  The ribs are 4 out 5 stars and they salads are definitely worth a look.,3
review_43729,drinks,"Jolta Java. I've had you on my radar for a few months. I remember stopping by once a few years ago and had a pleasant experience. This time... Not so much.\n\nThe coffee drink I got was tasty, and I'm very happy that they carry both almond milk AND soy milk for us lactose intolerant folk. This is where my happiness ends.\n\nThis place needs a SERIOUS deep clean. The floor was covered in crumbs, the tables were littered with debris of various food and paper products. The fake plants were dusty and if you look up to their massive ceiling, all the huge pipes are COVERED in dust. It's an asthmatic nightmare. People would finish their beverage or food and then the table wouldn't be cleaned for a minimum of ten minutes.\n\nThe staff were completely apathetic to all of this. It wasn't busy, so they stood around behind the counter either looking at their cellphones, chit chatting, or watching the Olympics. Sad customer service. \n\nThe more I type out, the more I realize that this shop needs more than a cleaning. It needs an attitude and staff adjustment. \n\nI doubt I'll return.",1
review_452457,drinks,"Meh.\n\nMy standards for quality froyo are high since I frequent Yogurtology (Shea and Scottsdale), Yogurtland (I'm the Duke in Scottsdale), and sometimes I go to Mojo in Tempe. \n\nThis place has \""ok\"" flavors. I had the original tart, that was quite a bit tart. The toppings are ok. My friend really liked the fact that they have banana chips, but that's because we usually eat our froyo at home and we were far away from home, and she didn't have to use her personal stash. \n\nSince it made her happy, I gave this place an extra star. I'm cool like that.\n\nHmm...let's see. They have a snow machine. Not really sure what this is for. It seems out of place. \n\nIt's far from my house, and not really worth my drive. I guess if it was by my house, and I had no other options, I'd frequent this business. \n\nThis is the one time, and one time only that I will say this.....Thank God, I live in Old Town Scottsdale.",1
review_208035,drinks,"One Monday night, we came to Triple George after a nice happy hour on Fremont East.  I was excited to try this spot as it's been getting a bunch a great reviews.  Also, I'm ALWAYS looking for a new place to Yelp :)\n\nThis place is pretty spacious!  Dark wood panels with a HUGE bar.  It practically goes the length of the entire place. Then, when you pass the bar, you think it's over and then there's another room in the back with more dining tables.  Great space.  \n\nI don't remember our servers name, however, she was a little interesting.  She had a soft voice and a loud voice.  The soft voice came across with a slight English accent and the loud voice was straight American accent.  I thought maybe it was me, but then the entire party of 6 said the same thing!  Maybe it was a trick, however, not really funny.  Just plain weird!\n\nFor my meal, I asked another server for any beer specials and he brought me a list of $3 beers!  WOW, I was sooo happy and drank a few Miller Lites that night.  I also had the Calamari appetizer for $8.95.  The calamari was lightly breaded and cooked great.  It wasn't rubbery at all.  My only rant: It needed salt.  No flavor!  The marinara sauce was warm and a great compliment to the breaded flavor.  \n\nOk, now the really bad part.  When the bill came, I found out all my beers weren't $3 at all.  The menu that was passed to me by another server was a beer specials list for Mob Bar next door.  First off, I thought they were connect since there's a door leading to the bar that was open.  And of course, why would a Triple George server give me a Mob Bar menu without telling me.  It didn't make sense.  When I brought it to the attention of our \""British\"" server, the American accent came out and corrected me.  Although funny, I wasn't buying her spiel.  Not a good impression.\n\nThis bar is close to the action, yet far away, if that makes sense.  I'm not going to line up here again, but I also wouldn't mind revisiting, if given the opportunity.  Maybe my next visit will be better!",2

review_204070,drinks,"We had dinner reservations the night we came to the Petrossian Bar, so we were looking for a quick bite and a cocktail.  We had a lovely snack, the Chef's choice cheese plate and Beef Carpaccio.  The Beef Carpaccio was wonderful, but not a big portion, I would have like a little more.  The cheese plate was the perfect size.  We tend to sit at Bars, they are often much friendlier than tables, and we had a great time chatting with the Bartender, who hooked me up with tastes of several different Bourbons.  It's a little expensive, but really, we're at the Bellagio and expensive sort of comes with the territory.",3
review_21587,drinks,"Maybe I'm just picky but when I have to pump my own coffee from a large container that has been sitting there for who knows how long, I'm thinking it's not the best cup or the best service.

Would it be that much of an inconvenience to pour me a fresh cup?",1
review_166117,drinks,Great dive bar. I love the bacon bloodymary! If you go out and rage the best thing to do the next morning is to take a cab to Double Down the next morning and have a few of the bloodymarys HANGOVER GONE! I have been a few time they have live music and it is a fun time. \n\nOnly reason I give this bar 3 stars instead of 4 or 5 is that I do not smoke and it seems that most of the people who like this bar do. The first time i went the smoke was so thick that when I smelled my jacket the next morning I almost threw up it smelled so bad. \n\nI suggest that you check this place out but I also suggest that you wash your clothes ASAP the next day.,2

review_422783,drinks,"I was definitely expecting a beautiful bar being that's it's inside the Aria but it wasn't anything special. Service was pretty quick at introducing themselves and taking our order. We had to seat on these lounge chairs that after a while were uncomfortable and I kept sliding down. Seating at the bar wasn't an option counting that there's only like 10 bar stools. The bar sure is tiny, chairs look hell of uncomfortable and I laugh at the \""full bar\"" because they can't even make a pi\u00f1a colada! Mediocre drinks at $12! I had two Vegas Baby! can't say they were amazing, they tasted like your typical Cosmo. My friend order a San Francisco and couldn't even finish it because it was too strong in the bad way, it tasted like crap despite the nice banana aroma. \n\nAmbience is chill and relaxing but we were stuck next to this poor girl and her horrid date. He couldn't use his indoor voice so we found out that she was mad at him because he bought her an expensive purse, her sister told her all he wanted was to smush; here we spent half an hour hearing this unattractive guy scream about how he enjoys when everything sucks.\n\nLadies: no cute guys worth while, not even the barteners qualify!",1

I recommend the almond milk tea with boba, which is my personal favorite.\n\nI almost cried when I thought they went out of business after they closed their old location but they ended up relocating so go to this one and try it out!",4

They had some good drink deals... but I was the lowly DD. Service was slow... and when I say slow I mean like a turtle walking in molasses. It took about 20 minutes just to get a soda. I could have driven to Frys and bought my own. \n\nThe atmosphere is ok, just bar-ish. The food on the normal menu is wayyy over priced for Mexican. I ended up ordering the fancy shmancy hot dog which you can personalize. I asked for guac on mine but didn't get any. It took about 45 minutes to even get my hot dog and I was so hungry I wasn't going to let that thing out of my sight.\n\n If  you do happen to stumble upon this place ask for the flour tortilla chips-I could live my life happily only eating those things :)",2

review_44337,drinks,"I went back recently with a friend for happy hour. We were excited to have some sushi and enjoy a drink on this nice night. We were told that there were no tables outside available for happy hour except for high tops, where we could seat ourselves. As we walked over to the high top table area, we passed at least one open table in the happy hour section (for which we weren't even offered to wait). Our server brought us menus, waters, and then disappeared. When she finally came back, my friend ordered a blushing geisha. After that, the waitress left and over the next 25 minutes, frequently checked on her other tables around us, but ignored us completely. Finally, after getting her attention, she took our food order. I asked for a sample of a red wine, and the glass came out filthy and unpolished. When our food arrived, the server took our edamame before we had finished them. We also had to ask for soy sauce (the dispenser was empty), wasabi and ginger. \n\nI was really shocked, because RA has such a good reputation. Needless to say, this server did not get a good tip, and the only reason I will return is because I am particularly fond of one of their happy hour items.",1
review_588078,drinks,"Stopped by the tasting room last night with a group of nine and had a great experience. While I do love Four Peaks on 8th, it can sometimes be so crowded with college folks that it becomes annoying, and if last night was any indicator of the general crowd of the tasting room, I'll be trekking over here fairly regularly. They only serve beer and wine, all of Four Peaks' brews plus a guest tap or two and whatever concoction Four Peaks is currently working on, so you need to know that you like their stuff, plus no food, so bring your own. But in terms of it being a relaxed atmosphere to put down a few and enjoy company in peace, it's the place to be. You'll find me here from time to time playing Elder Sign or some other nerdy game for sure.",3

(Is anyone as excited as me about the completion of their renovations?) \n\nThis place has some of the best beer on the planet, you may not find that your particular beverage of choice is on tap, but just like food, beer is seasonal. For me it is all about their belgians...strong, tasty, and ultimately dangerously tasty. For those who simply can't decide where to begin, they have sampler platters available. \n\nAlso, they have some of the most hard-working bartenders I have ever seen here! They must have type caffeine+ blood because they just don't stop. Don't hesistate to ask a kind question, they will let you know everything about that beverage while simultaneously pouring you a sample and straightening your tie. \n\nThey also offer some good, simple dishes here at very reasonable prices. Pizzas are great because they are so shareable and always have such fresh and unusual ingredients, although they offer soup and sandwiches as well...\n\nWith beer this good you could serve it to me in a leaky basement and I would still give this place five stars!

I haven't yet checked out the beer garden, but it's on my list for that rare sunny day. \n\nAlthough it's a chain (sigh) the food is quite good and reasonably priced (Nicolsons, I'm looking at you). We had the lamb & mint pie and fish & chips, and they were both cooked perfectly, the flavors were spot-on and the portions generous, each for under a tenner.

review_27757,entertainment,"I've recently been trying to find a cool place to play shuffleboard in North Phoenix.  I was trying to find a place to hang out near my bro's house so we could go hang out for a bit and have a beer.  I found Brennan's online and noted that they had shuffleboard.  WIN WIN!!  The review said that the staff was friendly and called you \""honey\"" even if it was the first time you had ever been there.  BANG!  sounds like my kinda joint, so  i called my bro and said, \""hey man, let's go to this joint by your house and play some shuffleboard and have a beer\"".  So, off we went.  I got there and when I approached the bar, the bartender looked at me like I was from Mars. I said hello, FIRST. She says Hi.  Then I said \""How's it going?\""  I felt like I was demonstrating to her how to greet a customer. So I ordered drinks, asked for shuffleboard disks and some menus. I was told that I could grab my own menu and that if I wanted something, I needed to come back and order.  Cool,  no biggie,  but no points for hospitality there.  No real attempt at gaining some sort of an EARNED tip, no prob, it's only my first impression of the place.  SO,  we play some shuffle board.  5 red disks, 3 blue, that's all they have and the shuffleboard table was not in proper working order and it wasn't like the guy sitting on his butt in the office right there was gonna check on us to see if everthing was okay.  So, it don't matter, we's having some beers and it's all good.  We get hungry and decide to look at the menus.  The menus said that THURSDAY was Indian Fry Bread day. Apparently, I am told that they haven't done that IN A LONG TIME.  I guess they didn't get around to changing the menu, but hey it's only my first impression of the joint.  Glad the regulars love it, they can have it.  Oh and I agree with a former poster about the Irish draw of the place.  I thought it was gonna be an Irish place,  not even close.  Crappy hospitality, limited beer menu etc......",1
review_587789,entertainment,"Dear LA Fitness,\n\nI come to this location (driving past another for an extra ~3 miles) for the brand new equipment, relatively large space in the free weight area, stadium spin room, rows of cardio equipment and to see my awesome trainer Mike. \n\nI would consider myself a regular in that I'm here at least four times a week. \n\nBut what I don't do is come here on Sundays. Ever.\n\nSo when I signed up for an Abs Clinic smack dab in the middle of a Sunday I really thought it about. I imagine the other (roughly) twenty people that signed up did as well. It was at 1pm after all. Kind of putting a crimp into breakfast, brunch and/or lunch plans. On Father's Day.\n\nBut, hey, abs are important and I wanted to learn something new.  I was a bit bummed to learn the clinic was cancelled at 1:15pm. Again, On Father's Day. For future clinics it might help to also collect cell numbers (or emails) to contact members. This way folks can adjust their calendars. I hope the trainer feels better soon.\n\nThanks,\nIrene\n\nAnyone checking out this gym should probably read my earlier review.

At Steele Indian School Park on a sunny spring day, when we arrived we were told at the gate that the event was sold out.  Since we had our tickets already we still got in (and fortunately found a great parking spot).  I was really happy that they had capped the number of people and started turning folks away instead of just trying to sell more tickets since sometimes events of this type get way too crowded and so they are just not fun.\n\nThe food choices were not that great and as others have mentioned the lines were long.  Waiting in line for 30+ minutes for a plain cold hot dog was not fun.  They did have free water but not much and it was warm.  Shade and seating were severely lacking as well.\n\nBut the beer, oh, the beer!  I wish that all the breweries had cards or something with their name on it to hand out because there were a lot of great craft brews that I had never even heard of and now I totally don't remember their names.  Fan favorites were Left Hand Brewing Co. and New Belgium but since this was STRONG beer festival, they brought along some of their lesser known options that had 6% alcohol content or more.  Local favorites Four Peaks, Barrio, Sleepy Dog, and of course San Tan (winter warmer rocks!) were all there so that was fun.  Throughout the afternoon I tried some beers I liked and some I didn't but it was fun chatting with the brewers and also other festival goers and getting recommendations to suit my preference.  This place was heavy on the IPA offerings but I found a few new stouts and porters that I really liked.\n\nReally friendly, casual, laid back event with great people and great beer.

review_412214,entertainment,"I hate this club. There's always a long line to get in, luckily being from Las Vegas, a lot of my friends either work in the nightclub industry or have friends that work in the nightclub industry.. so getting into the clubs isn't hard. The club is actually quite big but it always gets super crowded. The dance floor is small and is very packed. The music sucks and is a weird mixture of pop, techno and house with about 10 seconds of hip hop mixed in. The drinks are ridiculously expensive. $10 for a Corona. If you have to go here for some reason, then fine, other wise don't go and check out all of the other BETTER clubs in Las Vegas.",0
review_444317,entertainment,"Not a good activity for kids 6 - 7 years old.  This is primarily due to the fact that kids under 8 are not permitted to participate in dodgeball or play on the main trampolines without a chaperone.  We brought our son who is 7 1/2 and his friend who is 7.  Basically their only choices were to play in the 'little kids' are (where they had to avoid jumping on very small children) - or - stand in a long line, jump into a foam pit and get out.  One other attraction was closed, so I'm not sure what ages were permitted in that area.  Probably won't go back even when our son turns 8.",1

There really isn't a bad seat in the house (unless you have vision/hearing problems).  The beer and wine selection at their concession has much more variety than I expected and their box office is a breeze to deal with.  \n\nSeriously, how many times can you go see Phantom?  Avoid the tired mainstream stuff and check out the edgy shows that ATC is putting together.  You won't be disappointed and you might even expand your horizons.",4

review_537282,entertainment,"Well, went back here to watch one of the NCAA semifinals. On Saturday night an entire section of the bar was reserved for a kids baseball team and their parents. Is this a sports bar or a Chucky cheese? Thought that was kinda lame. I only mention that because as we were sitting at the bar eating our $2 garlic parmesan fries (which had a nice amount of garlic on sturdy frozen steak fries) we noticed the big TV at the bar was very blurry. Yes, we were seeing double on that TV, so we had to move, but 1/2 the bar was off limits. Blurry TV..uhhh get it fixed. \n      The drink specials and beers here are always good, but food is still kinda shaky. As a sports bar, how can you not have mozzarella sticks or potato skins on the menu? My friend ordered the $7.95 BBQ chicken dinner, but this isn't BBQ, the breast is off the bone and then they simply cover the chicken with a bottled? BBQ sauce. So, it's technically  BBQ chicken, wink, wink, but real BBQ chicken is on the bone and actually gets sauced while cooking. My entree was way more successful as I had the Orchard salad with blackened chicken added for $2.95, which made this salad about $12. The chicken is this dish was outstanding, a great version of the blackened seasonings. My request for dressing on the side was ignored, so I just ate it anyway and the raspberry vinagarette, which the waitress said was homemade, wasn't too sweet afterall. Alot of tasty walnuts and dried cranberries appeared as well. \n    Waitress and follow-up guy server were very attentive and nice and I thank the management for sending me a gift card which I used to fun most of the meal.",2
review_208267,entertainment,"I had the fortunate chance to score some really great tickets through my cousin,  and I mean really great.  The seats were amazing, really close the stage....a bit to the left (when facing the stage), and just 7 rows back from the Orchestra.  I didn't realize how large the actual theatre was until the end of the show where I had the opportunty to look back.  And it's pretty big.\n\nThe sets were amazing, and perhaps even easier to appreciate considering the closeness of the seats.  They were lively and almost always moving that I guess it also helped make the performance move along nicely.  I particularly found the chandelier piece and the sides of the theatres amazing and definitely adding to the set decor and beauty of the stage.\n\nThe performance itself was really great, condensed, but great.  I never knew that that the Broadway shows in Vegas were meant to be shorter than their normal run-time.  Someone once said it's because people out here have shorter attention spans.  I think it's just more to prevent people from being out of the casinos for too long.  Afterall, it is Vegas.",3

We were staying at the Stratosphere so we did receive discount tickets (if I had paid full price I would have been fully ripped off). The headliner Clair SinClair....has a nice speaking voice perhaps her next gig will be to replace Vanna White on Wheel of Fortune, she is pretty but her part in the show is minimal at best. Her speaking parts left the audience wondering why she was speaking. The dancers are good and the singer is good for most of the numbers but some were hard on the ears. The band is very good, we would have rather listened to them.\n\nOne of the people in our party even fell asleep that is how good the show was. We stayed thinking it would get better, it really didn't. The first half is definitely better...so if you want to leave do so by June it is pretty much down hill from there.  \n\n The show is a run through Claire's pin up calendar.... longest year of our lives!

review_458183,entertainment,"Let me just start by saying that admission to this place costs more than the Phoenix Zoo... and it's in a mall!  Once I was able to get past that, and realized that my still under 3 year-old daughter got free admission, I really had a good time.  I had no expectations going in, but the exhibits they had were really impressive.  All I had to do was look at the expression on my daughter's face as she ran from aquarium to aquarium yelling \""Daddy, do you see that?!\"" to know that it was worth the trip. The best part of the exhibit was the large tank at the end with a viewing tunnel going through it.  This gives you almost 360 degree views of everything from sharks to rays to jellyfish.  \nWord to the wise, though, if you're planning on making a trip to this place, maybe call ahead and see if their are any field trips planned for the day.  We showed up at about the same time as 10 school buses did, and spent most of the day dodging 200 running, screaming elementary school kids.\nHaving lived in AZ for nearly 5 years now, and not getting to see a whole lot of sea life in that time, Sea Life AZ was a pretty neat experience and a place that I will definitely take my daughter to again... but only until she turns 3",2

review_153545,entertainment,"I've stayed at the Strat at least once a year for the last five years.  This has always been an out of the way hike from the main strip, but it used to be a cheap and fun place to stay.  Sadly I've seen a steady decline at this place.  The closing of the Sahara down the street seems to have hit this place hard.  Five years ago this was a cheap place to stay with a lot of entertainment right in the building.  Now it's only good for a cheap place to stay if you plan to spend your days elsewhere, especially if you have already seen the view from the tower.  The current owners bought this place about five years ago at the height of the real estate bubble.  Since that time they've lost money almost every month and have engaged in some serious cost cutting to try and ride out the recession.  In the last five years they've closed Polyester's nightclub, Lucky's Diner, the celebrity impersonator show, the topless pool on the roof, their steakhouse restaurant and bar,  and most of the live bands that play in the casino.  The impersonator show used to be fun for kids and adults alike.  Now they've got very little in the way of entertainment or dining going on.  \n\nThe slot machines used to be among the loosest in Vegas, on my most recent visit I noticed the average payout for a bonus round was about $20.  Yawn.  OK, this is the same story at most of the casinos since the recession hit, but they used to have decent rules blackjack tables with $5 minimums.  On my most recent visit last weekend I was appalled to learn that they now pay 6:5 blackjack on most of their  tables.  They still have a few 3:2 tables, but they have $10 minimums, so of course all the clueless morons flock to the $5 minimum tables with the 6:5 payout.  If you want the 3:2 payout, you'll probably be sitting alone at a table, which I don't like.\n\nOn a recent visit I stayed at the Plaza downtown.  Brand new rooms for less that the Stratosphere, the Freemont Street experience and all the entertainment there nightly right outside the front door, and the Golden Nugget right down the street with some of the best blackjack rules in Vegas.  Looks like I'll be spending most of my visits downtown from now on.  So long, Stratosphere.",1
review_376337,entertainment,"I went here for the first time after seeing the Abbacadabra show, the tribute to Abba, and I have to say I like the look of the lounge, the live band, and the drinks. What I did not like was that one of the cocktail waitresses made it extremely clear that she did not like the smoke from my friend's cigarette. She said aloud to another cocktail waitress, I can't stand the smoke while she was tilting her head back trying to breathe air from above the smoke being a drama queen before finally taking off to another section. That was plain rude and I believe that she is in the wrong business if she cannot handle smoke. It is okay to remove yourself if possible, but don't make it obvious right in front of us that you have a problem, she might as well have just came up and snatched the cigarette right out of his mouth. I don't think I will come back, anyway it's not often I find my self at the Las Vegas Hilton.",1

The home department is a little scattered but it is still shoppable.

I have had jobchae, kimchee, kimbop and seaweed salad from there.\n\nThe food court is perfect for when you need a quick bite before grocery shopping, knowing that if you walk in to Greenland hungry you will end up buying everything in the store. My favorite food court item is the mussel champong (spicy seafood and noodle soup) from the stand in the corner, the name escapes me. So yummy.\n\nBe sure to get your Greenland Market rewards from the cashier. For every $500 you spend, you get a $10 coupon/voucher to use towards future purchases.",4
review_350581,shopping,"I actually stumbled across this place by accident.  For some reason, I've never really been a big fan of Mesa and I'm not exactly sure why.  I had even dated a dude who lived in Tempe and whenever we went out, I'd always choose Scottsdale/Phoenix/Chandler over Mesa.  Weird.\n\nAnyway, it just so happened that my aunt and uncle were down here visiting and for whatever reason, they needed to go to some place in Mesa - so my mother and I tagged along.\n\nWe were looking for a place to eat when we drove by the Mekong Plaza.  Curious, we pulled a U-ey and checked it out.  One end of the plaza was virtually deserted, but once you rounded the corner, we found the main entrance and some little restaurants.  We ended up deciding on Chinese food for the afternoon - oops!  I mean, \""Taiwanese\"" food.  I dunno how I could've gotten those two confused.  Heh.  Anyway, I'll review that place later...\n\nAfter lunch, we decided to look around while we were there...\n\nA lot of the retail space was vacant, but they did have miscellaneous lessees, such as: a barber, cell phone shop, various small restaurants, a gift shop, a nail supply store, a dentist, and of course, the supermarket.\n\nThe gift shop was small and quaint.  They had some cute little trinkets.  They were super expensive, though.  They had this Hello Kitty case that was identical to one that I bought from Target.  I paid about $4.00 for mine, but they were selling it for $17.00.  \n\nThey were also selling faux Coach bags.  I still don't fully understand how that appreciates Chinese culture - maybe there is pride in manufacturing pieces of *bleep* that look like the real thing from a distance, but are so poorly constructed that your hands actually feel dirty after touching them.  Not only that, but they were selling them for $70!  That's way too much for fake (unless we're talking about my blonde highlights)!\n\nI wasn't too keen on a dentist's office being in what is basically a strip mall.  \""Honey, I'm going to the Mekong for some Orange Chicken and oral surgery!\""\n\nNow, onto the market!\n\nWhen you first approach the market, it's kinda impressive.  They have some items on display outside of the store, so it's kinda like you're walking through an indoor street fair to get to the market.  \n\nThere are two very distinct things you notice when you first arrive and stand in the entrance:\n\n1)  The store carries so many products!  You could probably find just about any South East Asian food item you were looking for, plus some traditionally Western items like Heinz Ketchup and Campbell's Soup.  \n\n2)  The STENCH!\n\nFrom the entry, there was a foul odor of rotting flesh and fish hanging in the air.  Now, don't go stating the obvious \""Well, it IS an Asian market, moron!\""  I know that.  However, there is no excuse for that type of \""aroma\"" polluting the air.  The fish/butcher counters are not close enough to the front door to warrant such a concentrated pungency.  As a result, I'm left to question either the cleanliness of the market or the freshness of their meats, and if I have to do that, I will err on the side of caution, therefore, their meat/fish departments will not receive my business.\n\nOther than that, the store wasn't bad.  They had a nice produce section that had a reasonable variety of veggies and herbs.  The items that they placed on sale had kickass prices (i.e. Chinese eggplant $.69/lb., patis $.89/bottle, coconut milk $.69/can, etc.).  Aside from the items on sale, I think their prices are mediocre, if not on the higher side.\n\nAs I was checking out after buying a few cans of coconut milk, a bottle of patis, and some canned sardines, I asked the cashier how long they had been open, since I saw \""Grand Opening\"" signs hanging from the ceiling.  She didn't speak English, at least, not English I could understand, so the previous customer was kind enough to stay and translate for us.  Apparently, the store had been open for six months, which still makes it relatively new, I guess.  Too new, IMO, for that foulness to be permeating the air.\n\nIt was nice to visit the Mekong Market, but it's not any place I'd go out of my way for.  If you're closer to a Lee Lee or one of the other ethnic markets in the valley, they would suffice just as well.  If you feel the MM beckoning to you, though, make sure to take advantage of their bargain sale prices, and use your own good judgement when venturing to the land of meat and fish.\n\nWhile I think the store in and of itself rates 4-stars, I'm assessing three because there is no excuse for the poor air quality.  At the very least, they could invest in some better ventilation or fans (or gas masks)!",2

The store is owned by a husband and wife team and they take such pride in their product. I didn't want to spend too much on a wedding dress but I really loved the Watters collection and they are the best location to go when searching for this designer. They were so helpful and treated me like a princess from the moment I stepped in the store. I was nervous to come b/c I knew that I wouldn't be spending as much as the typical bride and I didn't want to feel out of place. They made me feel sooooo incredibly comfortable and found me the perfect dress for $1200 off the price that it originally was. The assistant that they have working there is so sweet also. She is in fashion design school and had some great ideas to complete the look of my dress. My sister came here for when she was looking to get married 2 years ago and after that experience I knew that when it came my turn there was no other place I would want to go. They made the day really magical and I am so thankful for the professional and superior service. GET YOUR WEDDING DRESS HERE! YOU WONT REGRET IT!,4

Good basics such as soy sauces, sambal oelek, chutneys and many varieties of pastes for all kinds of sauces from Thai to Chinese to Malaysian. A bit further on you'll see mostly Spanish (as in Spain) foods. \n\nDozens of hot sauces, many varieties of dried chillies, salsas, and several Mexican ingredients I've had a hard time finding elsewhere such as huitlacoche (corn smut/fungus, but it's absolutely delicious, especially in a quesadilla!) and large cans of posole/hominy. \n\nThere is a decent selection of some American foods such as pancake mix, canned pumpkin, cake mix and peanut butters. Canadian maple syrup too. I was hoping they would stock iced tea for drinks but didn't see any on my visit. \n\nThere's also a small section of Jamaican and other Caribbean foods, not just hot sauces. \n\nThe refrigerated case by the till offers chorizo, various Mexican cheeses (I didn't see any cotija on this visit but I'll be on the lookout), some really delicious looking fresh salsa and guacamole (a mum and daughter got some along with a bag of the excellent tortilla chips to share).\n\nThe freezer by the entrance offers pre-made burritos, ribs, frozen tortillas.\n\nYes, prices are a bit high generally since nearly everything is imported but for the most part they're fair especially considering the quality and selection. Service was super-helpful in recommending hot sauces and the right type of chilli powder for what we were looking to use it.\n\nWe didn't get as much as we would've liked because we had to carry it back a bit of a ways and the visit was sort of spontaneous, but it's a place I'll definitely return to.",3

review_436738,shopping,"I love Subway - they have tons of excellent dining options and are a nice break from all the fast food joints in the area. \n\nI went into this restaurant the other day for lunch with my girlfriend, though I'm not so sure I'll return to this particular restaurant. \n\nObviously I was buying food for both my girlfriend and I, but it was pretty clear the cashier and sandwich maker didn't speak English as their first language. I had to repeat several parts of our orders, and the cashier rang up our sandwiches SEPARATELY, even though we were obviously together and I had clearly stated this fact. When I pointed this out, the cashier said something like \""I only rang you up for that one\"" and didn't sound too sympathetic or caring. And believe me, when you have as much stuff as I do crammed in your pockets, pulling out that debit card multiple times IS a hassle.\n\nNext time, I think I'll go the few extra miles to the Lake Mead Pkwy./Basic location.",1
review_627530,shopping,"My boyfriend raved and raved about Winco and talked about his experiences going here often growing up in California. When they finally built out here, we ventured out to shop. Store front is large, in a good location with ample parking. Shopping carts are deeper than normal, which is smart. Store layout is somewhat of a maze in the beginning but is large inside with a lot of product. Prices are noticably lower on many items but not on everything.  It might take me a couple more trips to know what to get here to save money and what I can continue to buy at my neighborhood store. Staff is also very helpful and we used our spend $50 get $10 off coupon. Shoppers bag their own groceries so dont expect that when you shop here. Overall, I liked Winco and will return!",4
review_19024,shopping,"I started shopping at Buffalo Exchange over 30 years ago, and their offerings have gotten worse over time.  They used to have an outstanding selection of vintage clothing, and now it seems there is a lot of newer JUNK.  I have been completely unsuccessful when it comes to selling, so I don't even try anymore because I get insulted when I am offered $6 for a $200 item, and do not understand their reasoning for why they don't think most of my things will sell--yet, there is an amazing amount of REALLY UGLY STUFF on the racks.  I think the salespeople and \""buyers\"" are very ignorant about fashion.  All one has to do is look at how they dress...like bag people. \n\n3/30/13\n\nTELL YOUR CONDESCENDING MANAGER TO WASH HIS HAIR AND TAKE A SHOWER.  Just because you are promoting the alternative lifestyle, doesn't mean customers won't be offended by filthy, uncombed hair and such a slovenly presentation. GROSS!!! \n\nFINALLY GIVING UP ON THIS JOKE OF A PLACE :P",0
review_269719,shopping,"Not all Sprint stores are created equal. There are franchise stores and there are corporate owned stores. This Sprint store is a corporate store, and if you want a popular phone that is hard to get this should be one of your first stops. \n\nBe prepared to sign in and wait. In 3 years of coming here my typical wait is 30 minutes, it's been almost 90 minutes on a couple of visits. Customer service at this location continues to improve. On my most recent visit after a 40 min wait I was taken care of in about 25 more minutes from asking questions about phones to signing the contract and walking out the door. And on my most recent visit I didn't have to call Customer Care to clear up a problem after the sale. They got everything right the first time. \n\n3 Stars. I would give them 4 but I hate to wait, especially over 30 minutes. \nOne last thing: Parking is kind of tight especially if they are busy.",2
review_115385,shopping,"frys does have a great selection of most things you would expect from an electronic store.   The lines are long waiting to check out on some days, and they could use more people at the registers (46 registers, and 4 employes on them--waiting in line for 1 item 10 min).  Prices seem to be on par with other places and online.",2
review_433745,shopping,"Horrible customer service and over priced. I bought some bcaa's that were recommended to me by the guy there, they wouldn't even dissolve. Taste horrible too, I went to take them back and surprise they have a no return policy. Any company that believe and backs the products they sell should have a 100% guarantee. They will never get my business again! Also the first bcaa's the guy recommend to me had a warning on the label \""this product contains chemicals that have been proven to cause cancer in the state or California\"" wtf? Branch chain amino acids should be a natural supplement? \n\nI don't know how they call themselves a nutrition shop, obviously they only care about there profit margins and not your health or nutrition.",0

review_1808,shopping,"Honestly I don't consider this place a mall. I consider it to be the entryway I have to use to get into K-Mart. Sadly there are a few stores left still lingering around but hey, I'm sure the rent is reasonable considering the land is falling apart. Calling it a mall is like calling me an athlete it simply isn't true. When you can lists off the name of the stores on your fingers and still have a few left over then you need to go somewhere else.",0
review_451227,shopping,"Every self respecting fashionista makes an effort to visit Topshop regularly and we're very lucky to have such a lovely branch in Edinburgh. The shop was given a much needed make-over two years ago and now it's a wonderland of cool. Laid out over two floors (three if you include Topman), this shop can easily satisfy all your fashion needs - shoes, clothes, lingerie and accessories, you'll find it all here. There's even a personal shopper to help you piece together the perfect outfit. \n\nOn the lower ground floor there's a great little section selling clothes from up and coming designers (the Yuki stuff is fab), stock is limited so you'll be unlikely to bump into someone else wearing the same item.",4
review_42215,shopping,"Sorry, but I've been to this store in the past and although the assortment is beautiful, it is too pricey. Repairs are super pricey! I would recommend N&R gold and Silver across the street next to Micheal's, they're much less expensive.",3

Lets just say you get what you pay for and get what you need.  That's pretty much what it is good for.  You'll have to wait a while since they only seemed to have a few registers open to help check out their customers. \n\nThere were a few sketchy looking people out in the lot... so grab what you need and be on your way... haha.",2
review_605959,shopping,This place was very interesting... Quite a good selection of sugary rush/ candies to choose from. The shop is very attractive and colourful and thats what gets to you go in and then you buy stuff.\n\nThey also have icecream cream and lot of flavours to choose from which is great. I really liked there icecream. The scoops are nice size and they dont go cheap on it. The staff was awesome and friendly.,3
review_239420,shopping,"A great community resource, and with luck - you may find a treasure. The upstairs area sells books, housewares, vintage kitchen items, and linens. I've found many useful napkins, placemats, and cups/glasses here. The basement area is home/rehab focused: doors, sinks, hardware, garden tools, etc. As with any \""thrift\"" donation based business, you may need to return to the store more than once to find what you seek. If you are familiar with the hard work involved in cleaning, moving, lifting, and creating displays for many, many objects - you will appreciate Habitat. The staff does a great job.",4

When I arrived at 2pm the sore was closed. No signs up as to when they'd return. Very disappointed, thanks for wasting my time and fuel for you not to be here as your business hours state.

review_453475,shopping,"Our home has been using safeway grocery delievery online for about a year and a half now. Once you get used to the website, learn how it works and how to carefully select the options at the end of the check out its a great service! \n\n Yes, a few times our orders show up a bit late but we typically get a phone call from the driver or simply call and ask about our order. I have never experienced the bad service that most of the reviewers mention. \n\nOverall, in this house we've had nothing but a great experience with this service and we tend to order our groceries from them at least twice a week- when you get your groceries delievered it leaves a lot more room for fun and other things in the day vs spending an hour or so at the grocery store.

review_135421,shopping,"Bloomingdales Home is closing for good so there are some deals to be had.\n\nRight now they're at mostly 60% off, some 70% or 80%. \n\nLots of bedding, lots of plates and glass wear, lots of rugs, not too much kitchen appliance left, some beds and headboards, lots of Briggs and Britto luggage, womens fur coats, some chairs, accent chairs, dining tables but not a lot of furniture left. They are selling all their fixtures, display vases and decor as well. \n\nIt was always a odd thing to have a home store in a tourist mall....and one that closes before the mall closes so I can't say I'm not surprised. \n\nI'll be checking it often for further mark downs, but I found a few gems like a few serving dishes, baking trays and considering some white plate sets from here since they still have plates in abundance. \n\nOverall, good deals on things that would otherwise cost you way too much.",2

Since my ride isn't coming till 2.5 hours later, I'm now sitting here people watching and complaining. This must be how tortured men feel like with every forced mall experience.\n\nThe stores and the merchandise seem super outdated (duh- it's an outlet, clothes come here to retire, but this is pretty bad). The crowd is unsightly, the restrooms have long lines, bad smells everywhere, I walked the entirety in 30 minutes.  I want to take a nap or go to a real outlet mall.",0

It's only like three minutes from my house too, woohoo! Didn't like how 1/3 of the shelves were stacked with sci-fi. (Not my thing) Also didn't like how Fiction was narrowed down to only two shelves. What I did like were the sporadic and odd books I found. Picked up one satire type making fun of Mao Zedong, and Crime & Punishment for about 10 bucks in total. Sweet prices, but I'd take what Jason B. has to say about their cheap prices...haven't really traded any books here but I wouldn't anyway seeing as I love having books all over my house, ha. Either way, employees were alright and this places was decent. Location is also a plus!",2
review_87343,shopping,"As far as whole food is concerned.... psychology they would call this, the approach avoidance conflict. There are so many good things about this Whole Foods, yet the  bad are starting to gain in number. How is it that this store in Madison happens to not have many organic fruits,  A LOT of the time now?  And other stores do? Why have they not moved to a larger location, when obviously they need more room for parking, way more room in the isles and more organic fruits. Why don't they build one on the east side so people don't have to go as far and crowd up the west side store? And parking on certain days, forget it!  We are coming from Lake Mills to shop there. After living in Ca and going to the WF there, this store seems to be the smallest and the least stocked with items and internal restaurants...because of its size!!!  Who owns this place and why don't they move and expand????  I am agreeing with another writer here, it may be time to check out Woodmans, and I am indeed sad to have to say this. \n\nWhole Food in Madison, are you listening to your customers?????",3
