review_350112,restaurant,"The ambiance of Cafe Monarch is a 5 but we were really disappointed with the food.  I had the filet which by itself was flavorless.  The sauce was really good but it was necessary to mask the bland over cooked filet.  I ordered it medium rare and it was delivered medium well. My husband had the cannelloni and he said it was fair.  The cauliflower soup was good, salad fair and the dessert fantastic. We ordered the scallops and asked if that would be too much food. Our server said no and of course it was too much. Perhaps this was a bad night. The wait staff was attentive.",2
review_61764,restaurant,Food is good and cheap. I usually get delivery and it takes about an hour. Best chinese delivery place I have found.,2
review_168549,restaurant,"I have three words for Mon Ami Gabi: 1.) Perfect 2.) Perfect and 3.) Perfect.  This restaurant on the strip and inside the Paris Hotel & Casino is just perfect. From the extensive cocktail list, the extensive beer list to the assortment of cheeses to the menu of quality French food, you simply cannot lose! If you sit outside on the veranda there is great tourist/people watching and the weather is always sunny in Las Vegas. They also have a vast variety/selection of Bloody Mary's (they used to have a Sunday brunch Bloody Mary Bar).  It's the perfect place for the perfect lunch. Did I mention that it was perfect? Because...it is.",4
review_494255,entertainment,"This is a weird place.  I wanted to love it, I really did, but I have to tell the truth.  The club was mobbed and seemed to be as hot a spot as there is in Vegas, but on closer inspection, it was really not so hot.  I had much better experiences at Tao and XS for nightclubs.  I had much better experiences at pool parties at Wet Republic and Encore.  I actually went into a Marquee pool party and left after 5 minutes to spend the day at the hotel pool.  The hotel pool kind of blew away Marquee in every way. \n  I wanted to love it, I swear, but it wasn't happening.  Sad but true...",2
review_121122,drinks,"I recently had the choice of sitting home in an empty apartment (my stuff was being shipped from Miami) or hitting up the FREMONT for the .99 Cent Margaritas...\n\nI opted for the margaritas!! THEY win everytime!!\n\nNext time lets skip the \""\""Tea Party Bullshit\"" = order 5 & have them put it in a large glass & order a tequila floater to top it off. NOW You're talking!!\n\nThen again, some of you might like having a little tea party. I DONT!!...ALOT of interesting characters wandering around & watch out for the elderly in their souped up electric wheel chair as they WILL do a \""Hit-n-Run\"" on your ass & not even flinch (because they probably NEVER saw you in the begin with!!).... You've been warned!!\n\nAlso I might add that the old grey haired bartenders are quite CREEPY!! It doesnt help at all that they have NO PERSONALITIES & wear these \""Barber-like\"" smocks & have on 1 plastic glove like they want to give you a FREE prostate exam!! My advice is just drink that much more .99 margaritas & think about \""butterflys in wide-open feilds\""... OR SOMETHING!! Try to ignore them & NOT think about it!!",2
review_443089,beauty,"Nothing special about this place.  Just fancy furniture and a pretty salon. They do terrible work, and are just rude.  There's better nail salons on eastern, so I doubt I'll be back here anytime soon.  It's also more expensive than the other shops.  Only positive is that they are clean.",1
review_590163,restaurant,"You can't find a place within 30 miles of ASU that has the quality of healthy food for the price , it is a friendly place with a character you do not find  in the franchises that serve inferior food at a higher price. The food is fresh, healthy, and very  priced ....only a walk from the ASIA campus. Best find for me this summer !",4

review_478461,restaurant,"Buffalo Wild Wings is a typical chain and the food is as expected. Two of my favorite sauces here are the Mango Habanero and Caribbean Jerk. \n\nThe dining area at this location has a ton of TVs of various sizes and most seats in the dining area have a good view. However, make sure not to get the corner booth near the stuffed animal claw machines. Some of your guests will not be able to see the TVs at all. I recommend asking to switch if you get placed there.\n\nThe service at this location is quite poor and the restaurant seems to be running at very low efficiency. To start, the hosts do not greet or even address customers as they arrive. There seem to be a ton of servers in the dinning area, but you never see any of them working. Instead, they stand around in pairs talking. Meanwhile, our food took about 15 minutes to arrive, which seems unreasonable for a fried appetizer and 10 of their trademark wings. Lastly, we only saw our server twice. One time was when we placed our order and the second (much to her fury) was when I had to walk our check up to the front of the restaurant to pay.",1
review_447695,entertainment,Being from Sweden you just like salmon and at Le Chalet you can get a delicous Nordique Crepe with salmon! Never had anything like that in Sweden! Besides the great crepe and friendly service from the owner Alain Keller I was also treated to a laughing experience. They have a comedy show twice a month. Great place to eat and have a nice relaxed evening!,4

review_49514,restaurant,"Unfortunately, this place barely gets three stars now.  \n\nThe good:\n-Wings.  They have always been good, and are still excellent.  Great special (49 cents per wing) on Sundays during football.  \n-Smoking area.  Although I quit years ago, this place has an awesome patio/bar area for smokers.  Climate controlled (misters and heat lamps) for summer/winter and new TVs, which are great for watching sports.\n\nThe bad:\n-Management sucks.  The service is chaotic on NFL Sundays, and I asked one of the managers walking by for a napkin, since the food runner didn't bring me one with my wings.  The manager with slicked back hair and the tatts on his forearms blew me off.  My waitress was overworked, but cool.  The staff has to wear these lame jerseys now, which gives this place a more corporate feel, similar to BWW.\n-Prices.  They have gone up significantly.  Better values at many other places in Tempe.  The rest of the food is mediocre.  \n-No more trivia.  They quit providing video trivia/poker.  Might as well go to BWW if you are looking for a wing joint that has trivia/poker.  We used to play poker at Native in groups out on the patio, but no longer.",2
review_575098,restaurant,"I love this restaurant and have only visited it about three times. The bartender Matthew (I'm pretty sure) is so nice and friendly and makes the best drinks. This is one of the only two restaurants I will eat and can't wait to go back, OH and visit my parents in Surprise :",3
review_588078,drinks,"Stopped by the tasting room last night with a group of nine and had a great experience. While I do love Four Peaks on 8th, it can sometimes be so crowded with college folks that it becomes annoying, and if last night was any indicator of the general crowd of the tasting room, I'll be trekking over here fairly regularly. They only serve beer and wine, all of Four Peaks' brews plus a guest tap or two and whatever concoction Four Peaks is currently working on, so you need to know that you like their stuff, plus no food, so bring your own. But in terms of it being a relaxed atmosphere to put down a few and enjoy company in peace, it's the place to be. You'll find me here from time to time playing Elder Sign or some other nerdy game for sure.",3
review_105821,restaurant,"One of my fav's- They also have stores in Los Altos and Sacto.  I used to be stuck on the Chicken, but now it's the steak and enchiladas- If it's in season, be sure to have some of the cold vegetable salad- \""Escoveche\"" or something close to that.  Great martini's and the service- well a buddy of mine lost a couple hundred dollars and got it back the next day.  This place is full of integrity and good food too!!  Try to get one of the open air booth's.",4
review_128207,medical,"I will update this review if I ever get an appointment.  However, after being referred for a possible retinal detachment, I have been kept on hold, cut off after 10 minutes, then kept on hold for at least another 10.  I talked to three people, one of whom just said that they have a high volume of callers.  Their front office staff is apparently really bad and has no customer focus.\n\nFirst update.  I waited 20 minutes on the second call, but finally talked to someone and got an appointment the same day.  That is worth an upgrade from one star to two.  I will post more after the appointment.",1
review_534947,restaurant,"I love everything about this place, and frequent it often for many reasons. The wait staff is always in a good mood, and pays attention to you even if the place is packed. The food is original, different than the run of the mill bar, and the craft beers are on point. You can try many beverages without breaking the bank. For $1 you can sample the many local and foreign brews. On the weekend you can stop in for a $10 brunch which includes a drink. They have good bbq, great appetizers, and I haven't had anything I didn't really enjoy and that's a serious plus. For their brunch the flatbread with breakfast on top rocks my socks. I would suggest this to my friends and I'll see you there! :)",4
review_21636,restaurant,"Seafood gumbo - not very fresh, smelled of seafood, very murky\nOyster poboy - mediocre, dried French bread, few strands of shredded lettuce, pickles and tomatoes on the side\n\nService - we were the only ones there at about 4 p.m. The waitress appeared to be uninterested and vanished for awhile \n\nHmm. I heard a little bit of buzz about this place. I definitely won't be coming back.",1
review_504256,others,"I've just checked out the pictures of this place which make it look halfway cool.  It's not.  \n\nYesterday, The Man asked me what I wanted to do for the day (because two of the three houses we were supposed to view are now under offer, sadface).  I responded \""get drunk.\""  He laughed and asked me again, and got the same answer.  This house hunting business is stressful, you know.  \n\nSo, about late afternoon time we took a walk down the canal to Leith.  We wandered around a bit because The Man wanted to go somewhere new, and we ended up on Constitution St which has a few places which looked good.\n\nWe started in The Constitution Bar and the minute we walked in we knew it wasn't for us.  The Man described it as \""soulless\"" and I thought it looked like an upmarket canteen.  The dining area actually had nice dark wood tables and chairs which, if they were in the main room, would make the place look a bit more interesting than the sterile blonde wood does.  \n\nThey were playing football through some dodgy (probably illegal) foreign channel which had drawn a few people in, but the minute the football was over, the majority of people left for more interesting pastures.\n\nThere is nothing actually wrong with this place, the staff weren't rude and the beer wasn't off, it just wasn't an enjoyable place for a pint and I would definitely not go back.",1
review_511425,beauty,"This place is a great value, especially for locals! I bought a groupon and tried it for the first time today. Pedro was great and he hit my tension zones and even stretched my neck and IT band. This hurt so GOOD! My body needed the deeper stretch to alleviate tension. I will be back. It is a little off the beaten path at 1601 E. Flamingo but worth it!",3
review_383880,restaurant,"Went here Thursday night for dinner. My family ordered the family feast and substituted cole slaw for Mac n cheese. The waitress forgot to bring my fathers code to the tableland we had to request it after 10minutes. The food arrived and the corn was overlooked, the fries were cold and the meat was mediocre at best. I would only recommend this place if you like poor service and have no taste buds.",0
review_443286,medical,"The worst customer service in the pharmacy, to transfer a prescription it has taken me six phone calls and three trips down to the pharmacy, on top of them not knowing what is going on they are rude and ignorant! The only reason I changed is because my insurance changed, looks like I need to find a new pharmacy because this one will not work for me.",0
review_81153,restaurant,"Loved this restaurant until today. Had the worst service I've ever had in a restaurant. Myself and three friends visited for lunch. Two in the party had never been to your restaurant. We were sat upstairs and waited on by a female bartender. From the beginning she acted like she'd rather be doing anything else...and honestly, she should be.\n1. She forgot to bring a coffee over that was ordered. When we first attempted to get her attention--she put a finger to shush us because she was headed to another table. Whe we were finally able to ask her about the coffee, she commented that she didn't forget, but that she didn't have any decaf until now. What's funny about that is just before she was refilling decaf coffee at the table behind ours...it's kind of hard to hide the orange coffee pot.\n2. When our food arrived, delivered by someone else after a long wait, she never once came to check on our table. We had to finally ask someone else to get her attention.\n3. By the time she came over, two of us were done. One person had not eaten anything because her food had been bad and since our server never checked on us she sat there without decent food, the mashed cauliflower was stringy and the squash was covered in so much oil/butter it was inedible. When my friend who had been unable to eat told our server, the server rudely picked up my plate and the bad food plate. She looked at my friend and in a very nasty tone of voice goes \""Well, (exasperated breath) do you want to order something else or are you just done?\"" and then looked at the other person who was finished and ordered her to hand over her empty plate.\n4. Then in yet a nasty tone she rudely asked us if we wanted anything else or just our check. She was clearly through with our table. When she brought the tickets over, she handed them out to the wrong people--we had to correct that. And when she immediately returned and our money was not yet on each tablet, she made a loud groan, threw her hands in the air at our table and walked off.\nI've never left a restaurant without tipping. This table had two people in it who each had over 20+ years in the restaurant/service industry. And we were horrified at the level of disrespect and lack of service we were given today.\nAnd to top it off, when we asked for a manager we were told that there was no one in the building who could help us, but we were more than welcome to take a menu with the phone number on it if we felt the need to call later. How do you expect to run a restaurant and deal with problems if there is no management?\nAbsolutely a horrible experience.",0
review_453475,shopping,"Our home has been using safeway grocery delievery online for about a year and a half now. Once you get used to the website, learn how it works and how to carefully select the options at the end of the check out its a great service! \n\n Yes, a few times our orders show up a bit late but we typically get a phone call from the driver or simply call and ask about our order. I have never experienced the bad service that most of the reviewers mention. \n\nOverall, in this house we've had nothing but a great experience with this service and we tend to order our groceries from them at least twice a week- when you get your groceries delievered it leaves a lot more room for fun and other things in the day vs spending an hour or so at the grocery store. I love this service!",4
review_58531,others,"No Frills Local Action.\n\nI primarily came to Jerry's Nugget for a prime rib dinner at the Jerry's Coffee Shop.  I have relatives in LV and they wanted something less fancy and less-expensive than Lawry's, so we ended up here.  See my other [forthcoming] review on the dining experience.   This is certainly not the _best_ Vegas has to offer from a gaming or dining perspective.\n\nI got spanked at the craps table at this joint.  Jerry's Nugget proved that the house always wins over the long run.  Only ONE craps pit here.  The whole family was here and we took up the table for ourselves and probably donated a G to Jerry's that night just at craps.  The only good rolls came from the only non-family member at the table, I made more money off of him than he did on himselft.  Unfortunately, I was too optimistic of everyone else in the family's ability to pass and gave it all back to Mr. Jerry. \n\nDealers and Pit Bosses are super friendly.  Props to Kevin - he'll talk your ear off and help you when things get good.  \n\nMade up for the punishment at the craps table with some action at the blackjack table.  This made me want to re-evaluate where I find the entertainment value of gaming in Vegas.  Craps is still my main vice.\n\nPros - \n-locals, locals, locals\n-small and intimate\n-little to no tourists\n-friendly dealers and wait staff\n-low table minimums\n-good for groups (you can't lose anyone here - try finding someone in a group of 10 in the MGM!!!)  \n-great coffee shop!\n\nCons - \n-sketchy neighborhood\n-out of the way && in the middle of nowhere \""old las vegas\""\n-little to no tourists\n-ZERO eye-candy (this ain't the Hard Rock)\n\nThis is a 1 star joint that gets 1 star for the friendly staff and 1 more star for the coffee shop with an extensive menu with cheap and decent prime rib.\n\nWould I return?  Yes\nWould I return just for gaming?  No...\nWould I return to eat then play?  Absolutely",2
review_551416,others,"Lets start with the check in. We go to valet the car, and valet guys are too busy talking to each other to do their job. Not one valet came to open the car doors, and I had to pull the luggage out of my car myself... not a great start. We had checked in earlier (locals having a staycation) so we didn't need to go to the front desk, but that didn't stop the one over-zealous employee YELLING at us 3x that we needed to go to the front desk rather than pointing us in the direction of the elevators to get to the room, as we had asked him. After finding our own way, we get into the room, and were absolutely dumbfounded. We PAID for a room upgrade, and when we walked in, our room was literally on par with a Motel 8 that had a 30th floor. Apparently they figured upgrade meant moving to a higher floor. View of roof tops and not much more (definitely no view of the strip, Fremont, or anything that resembled Las Vegas), no refrigerator, no coffee machine, bathtub was barely big enough for a normal size human being to sit in, and no additional seating other than the desk/dresser/tv stand chair (room looks nothing like the one posted... maybe that's their \""SUITE\""). Seriously. Motel 8. The rest of the stay was much the same, but made worse upon being told that their pool was closed. This turned into a benefit because they sent us to the Downtown Grand, who had a GREAT pool, sparing a guaranteed disappointing swim in theirs. As a local who just wanted to have fun on Fremont, and having stayed in many, many of the other strip properties, I found The D among the worse... 3 stars is really too good of a rating. For a Las Vegas hotel/casino you should EXPECT way better, especially when the hotel/casino is located in a \""hot spot\"".",0
review_427046,restaurant,My favorite sandwich chain. Everyone raves about the bobby and the Capistrami but I love their cheesesteaks. 3 stars for this specific location. The food is never consistent and my cheesesteaks are always under seasoned. My favorite location at red rock station would get 4-5 stars.,2
review_351114,restaurant,"Why does this hooter's get a two star compared to any other hooters? The staff.  Pretentious ladies.  I come here to grab some food and beers sometimes when i want to see the UFC fights.  Unfortunately sitting at the bar even on a slow UFC night I am pretty much invisible.  Service takes forever and sometimes I feel like its  a chore for them to get me a beer.  Hell they drop the beer and turn away before I can utter thank you.  It gets 2 stars for having the fights, beer, and reasonable prices.",1
review_486102,restaurant,"This place was right next to my gate and my flight was about to board so I decided to grab a bite from here -also because it looked like the only place where I could get food that wouldn't give me a heart attack. At any rate, the service was really fast which I appreciated and the wrap I got (turkey) was not bad. You can either get a pre-made panini (they didn't look good) or get a freshly made one for which you get to choose the ingredients; needless to say, I got mine made at the spot. I ended up paying $8.11 for a decently-sized turkey wrap with lots of veggies all of which were fresh. If you're around C-gates at Charlotte I'd recommend this place. Ingredients are fresh, service is quick, average sandwich place at an airport.",2

review_605416,restaurant,"For the last seven years that I've lived here, Morningside has become a more and more desolate neighborhood for amenities, especially when it comes to food, and a pleasant atmosphere for eating it, other than your own home. The neighborhood was pretty much limited to a bank (closed in June of 2013) a Rite Aid, a third world mini-mart specializing in lottery tickets, sodas and smokes, as well as some dusty packaged goods, a yinzer pizza shop with a MAJOR trailer park attitude...and six beauty salons that apparently specialize in 'suburban haus frau'. We had a Stagnos that closed several years ago, and a coffee shop that was way to uppity for the neighborhood, which also closed.\n\nOh...and the nuisance bar. That haven for yinzer drunks and drug addicts that made 'working class' look like royalty.\n\nWell, that nuisance bar was bought and renovated into a shiny and new Bulldog's Grille, and I have to say, although on opening, they were extremely limited in their offerings, it grew to become a terrific welcomed oasis in the neighborhood.\n\nWe decided to give it a try a Friday shortly after they'd opened, and were not disappointed on any real level, although once they got their chef up to speed it got even better.\n\nOn opening, aside from a full bar, they only had four items on their menu for opening week. A chicken salad, wings, a fish sandwich, and I can't remember the fourth. It wasn't a burger, which I'd wished it had been, but that would be coming soon, according to the waitress.\n\nSo my friend and I, in that never ending search for a fine fish sandwich, opted to try Bulldog's, and we were very pleasantly pleased. Although, in the typical style of da burgh, it came on a freakin' hamburger bun, the fish itself was very tasty, large, and the batter had a yummy zing to it. It was no frills though...just fish and a bun, with tartar sauce, and no inquiry if we'd maybe wanted cheese or lettuce and tomato. But, it was a very decent and filling flavorful sandwich, and the price was very reasonable. It came with fries, which were...well...fries. Nothing special, but not bad. Time went on, and Bulldog's found their chops, and now, a year or so later, that fish sandwich is something to seriously rival ANY of the so-called 'famous' fish sandwiches around town - YES, that means YOU Armand's and Neid's!\n\nOnce the burgers came into play - impressive again. Ok, they're never going to hit the level of Winghart's. BUT, for a bar burger? These are a step above the norm. Several varieties to choose from, cooked the way you like, and yum.\n\nIt's a very family owned business, with the owner, his wife, his in-laws, and even a mama running around helping out with the customers, and the place was FULL. At one point, mama even walked around with a tray of pepperoni rolls that she was handing out to anyone who wanted one. That was a very yummy homespun touch. The staff evolved into a knowing and helpful group of friendly faces that really do make you feel at home.\n\nAnd the crowd definitely brought Morningside up a level from what used to spew out of that building on any given day. A lot of family types (of course, it is Morningside) but there were also a lot of young and frankly good looking guys there that never seem to be visible at any other time in the neighborhood. Do they live here? One Kinsey Six could only hope.\n\nTerry Golden and his family have brought an oasis into the neighborhood. More upscale than one would expect for the neighborhood, yet, totally unpretentious. Excellent and consistent food, extremely reasonable prices, and just a generally VERY comfortable 'vibe'.\n\nOn the next visit, I tried the wings. Another winner. Plump, juicy, and creative sauces. \n\nKudos, Bulldog's, for bringing some modern style to an otherwise deprived neighborhood.\n\nAddendum: Had to re-write a few things and up it to a full five stars - they've truly earned it.",4
review_239420,shopping,"A great community resource, and with luck - you may find a treasure. The upstairs area sells books, housewares, vintage kitchen items, and linens. I've found many useful napkins, placemats, and cups/glasses here. The basement area is home/rehab focused: doors, sinks, hardware, garden tools, etc. As with any \""thrift\"" donation based business, you may need to return to the store more than once to find what you seek. If you are familiar with the hard work involved in cleaning, moving, lifting, and creating displays for many, many objects - you will appreciate Habitat. The staff does a great job.",4

review_362201,shopping,"Great location \n\nHere are my nit-picky suggestions:\n\n1) Keep your produce prices lower.  $4.99 for a pint of blueberries?   \n\n2) Focus on making sure your staff is greeting customers.  10 foot 10 second rule.  \n\n3)  if you see a line forming at the registers quickly call another register operator\n\n4) stop allowing people to park out front.

review_406197,others,"Went to this location this morning because we found some extra cash in the car before work, never will I ever stop at this location AGAIN.. Or for Mcdonalds for that matter.  My partner and I walked into the establishment & each ordered a meal to eat inside.  We went to go get our refreshments, as we were waiting 3 of the employees were staring at us then would look back at each other and laugh.  As our food was called my partner went to go get it.  I watched the 3 younger Hispanic guys watch my partner reach for the trey and yet again looked back at each other and started to laugh.  Basically expressing to each other something was done to our food.\n\n ME personally care about my own health and am NOT about to eat someone elses spit OR worse.  I immediately went to the cash rep whom was the manager and demanded my money back.  The food was still on the trey as well as the drinks we got (which by the way we had not even taken a sip). \n\n We told her the situation and she just gave attitude but for a fast food rest what do you expect... The gentleman were upset for their little \""plan\"" didn't go through like they were wanting.  How disgusting, unprofessional, and unethical.....

review_87343,shopping,"As far as whole food is concerned.... psychology they would call this, the approach avoidance conflict. There are so many good things about this Whole Foods, yet the  bad are starting to gain in number. How is it that this store in Madison happens to not have many organic fruits,  A LOT of the time now?  And other stores do? Why have they not moved to a larger location, when obviously they need more room for parking, way more room in the isles and more organic fruits. Why don't they build one on the east side so people don't have to go as far and crowd up the west side store? And parking on certain days, forget it!  We are coming from Lake Mills to shop there. After living in Ca and going to the WF there, this store seems to be the smallest and the least stocked with items and internal restaurants...because of its size!!!  Who owns this place and why don't they move and expand????

The place is very small and consists of large booths, round tables, and a bar.  If you come in with a party of 4 or more, you will have to put the round tables together. It is very awkward for your party as well as the tables near you.\n\nThe staff is friendly, but untrained.  We have been in 10 or more times. Each time with at least 8 people. The staff looks frazzled when they see the large party.  We've even seen them argue about where to put us. \n\nWith that said, I'll still keep eating there because the food is really good AND if you go on Sunday and get in on the Happy Hour prices, you can't beat the value!",2

review_532026,restaurant,"As I drove by Caffe Mona looking for a parking spot, (good luck. parking is on the street only) I seriously considered turning around and canceling my brunch plans. Wow. This place is a little frightening from the outside. However, when I was able to find a spot at a nearby meter, I cautious walked in and took a huge sigh of relief. The inside is quaint but charming. A few tables inside and looks like a deck with tables outside in nice weather. Although I was drawn to Caffe Mona because of the prix fixed menu, I decided that I really wanted to try the Elvis (crepes with peanut butter, bananas & bacon) and I thought that a third course of a sweet crepes might be a little much. In addition to my Elvis, I ordered a fruit plate for an app. I was rather disappointed in the fruit plate. I understand that most fruits are not in season in late March but I was expecting a little more than just apples, bananas and white grapes. It was not pleasing to the eye. Also to note, my plate was significantly larger than my two dinning companions who ordered the fruit plate as their first course with the prix fixed menu. A few minutes later, I was presented with the glory that was the Elvis. I can still taste the sweetness of the syrup and bananas perfectly complimented by the saltiness of the crisp bacon. I sat back and enjoyed every last bite while the girls were presented with their third course, a crepe with strawbery jam. In conclusion, don't judge a book by its cover. Although Caffe Mona looks rough and tumble from the outside, the food, atmosphere and decor are well worth the fight to find parking.",3
review_31688,beauty,"the Spa is TERRIBLE!\n\nwhere to start: first i had to change in locker room, which was thru the gym, and walk naked under my robe, thru the gym back to the spa.  NOT GOOD. secondly, my robe belt was wrinkled and tangled. like someone couldnt take 5 minutes to straighten it out?!!!\n\nnext, the waiting room for massages was CO-ED! wtf!!!! i felt so uncomfortable in my robe, sitting next to some dude who was also naked. No reputable spa would ever do this. \n\nthen, the tea area was messy, there was no hot water for tea, and the fresh cut fruit had no plates or fork to serve oneself. people were picking at it with their fingers. thanks i am thoroughly grossed out!\n\nthen the massage was OK at best. i told the lady to push harder, and she said \""we will see how your body reacts\"".  dumb girl, dont you realize i get massages all the time, and when men give me a massage, they will push the knots in my back so hard until they loosen up.  massage was weak and ok at best. \n\nthen, the in the shower room, there was  A SIGN THAT SAID, VIDEO SURVEILANCE IN THIS SHOWER AREA! WTFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF.   THAT IS SO UNACCEPTABLE!  SO UNACCEPTABLE, a place where people shower and go into jacuzzi is NOT a place where one can set up surveliance videos. \n\nanywhoo, to top this off, NONE OF THE 5 HAIR DRYERS IN THE LOCKER ROOM WORKED!

review_518820,housing,"The rooms in this hotel are small, but the location and the decor make up for the lack of space. Despite the size of the rooms, the designers somehow managed to pack a fridge and a ton of storage space into each room. Well done. Also, each room has it's dedicated wireless network, so Internet speeds are rather fast. My only suggestion for  guests would be to request a room that's on a higher level. My room faced Rene-Levesque Blvd, which is pretty noisy on Friday and Saturday nights until 2 or 3 am. I was on the 8th floor and could still hear a moderate amount of noise.

We had the chicken wings which were a bit sweet for our taste then had the bulgogi burger which was also a bit too sweet the bun was kind of hard and didn't taste fresh came with potato chips as well (seriously thats the best thing you can come up with! they were stale anyways!) also has another 2 dishes which I can't remember what they were obviously also mediocre since I can't remember what they were.

I could have driven to Frys and bought my own. \n\nThe atmosphere is ok, just bar-ish. The food on the normal menu is wayyy over priced for Mexican. I ended up ordering the fancy shmancy hot dog which you can personalize. I asked for guac on mine but didn't get any.

Ever since Paris is burning, I've been hooked. I have a healthy respect for queens who have been in the business for a long time.

review_440154,others,"If I could give this location a zero I WOULD.  Glancing at the reviews before me, I'm not the only person who left upset. I had to replace my damaged phone and this was the location I picked because I THOUGHT they would be nice considering it was a decent area and I knew it was 15 minutes from the house. It was a Friday at 2:30 PM.\n\nThis entire experience at this store was not just confusing but nothing but an anxiety trip.  The greeter has a poor attitude when I told him I was not here to add a line or purchase anything but I needed to replace my phone.  His attitude went way down.  Awesome.  After he ever so kindly told me I was misinformed from customer service on the phone that i could exchange my phone here. He hands me a piece of paper with the Asurion number. Mind you any other store you go to they at least HELP YOU, get you situated maybe even call the number and let you USE their land line since you have NOTHING. Nope, I used had to borrow a mobile device from a friend.  After th headache on the phone with this ignorant woman from Asurion who was incredibly unprofessional.  I walked back in WITH A SMILE ON.  Through this whole hair pulling process I stayed calm with everyone!  Instead I was the one who received poor attitude.\n\nMind you now it's close to 4 PM, Lee Ann the store manager came over to ask us what she could help us with.  She said she had seen us here awhile & I told her the greeter of her store has a poor attitude.  She then let him know to have I needed to be helped next and bumped me up the line. Tony tried to help me but he seemed to not be all there today from the rush of the new iPhones.. I told him I had to fill out the afidated process and get a copy of my recent bill.  He tried to look up my purchase history at the store instead (which was wrong) and asked me \""Do you have the Moto Atrix\""?  I said \""No, I have the galaxy note II and I didn't buy it from this location\"".  He then tells me, \"" Oh, well I don't see it here so I can't help you\"".  At this point I just want to throw my hands in the air and leave.\n\nColeen the assistant manager overheard the conversation and came over to see if she could help. I told her I was simply trying to replace my phone, I had gotten off the phone with customer service and was mistaken and was corrected by my friend it was Asurion I has spoken with. My nerves were just though the roof. Well Coleen did help, i filled the form out, she faxed everything over for me.  She said, \""Not to worry\"", and the process was \""all set\"".  I'm thrilled because I had this done before the cut off date that day so I should of gotten my phone the next day.\n\nYesterday my bf calls the insurance company to find out where my phone was, and the kind woman over the phone says to him, \""let's finish the process so we can send out your new phone\"".  So apparently I should of called the insurance company to make sure the paperwork was faxed over, and finalize the transaction.  I returned to the store to let Lee Ann know that I had not received my phone and that the paperwork wasn't finalized and I did feel as though I should of been told to make a call to the insurance company.\n\nWell after we went back and fourth as polite as I could be with Lee Ann she just wanted to lock horns with me. I told her I was simply there to let her know how the situation went yesterday and how I was unhappy with the service. I should of known about this finalized call.  She then proceeded to tell me, \""Well if we had to call every time that happened, I just don't know\"".  I could tell this conversation was going no where fast. I'm pretty good at reading body language and she was making me uncomfortable with her tone on top of it, like I did something wrong for bringing this to her attention.\n\nMind you earlier when we were waiting for her, she came out of the backroom and wished other customer's to have a great night..  I took it personal when she didn't even bother to say that to us when we were leaving after I had told her, \"" Well I hope you enjoy your vacation\"".  I can't believe how bitter she came off to not only me but this guy that interrupted our conversation saying he needed help. She turned to him and says, \""WELL, I'm with a customer and you'll just HAVE TO WAIT\"".  My point being, this WHOLE thing could of been resolved, swiftly and promptly within a 20 minute spand if I was helped correctly. But Lee Ann couldn't be BOTHERED at her job, I just wanted to leave before I wasted my breath anymore. Sorry, I was an inconvenience and I will take my business where it's appreciated.\n\nI'm not happy Micheal (the guy we bought our Note IIs from) was transferred to the Meadows Mall! I will make sure to deal strictly with him since he treated us well, never hid anything from us, told us everything we should of expected and then some. He went above & beyond our expectations. I liked that he basically held our hand through all the entire process, that's customer service.",0
review_354320,restaurant,"Hmm, I'm lost to understand the high praise for Dusit, as it left me feeling very much wanting, and I was so disappointed in that. For what was delivered, it was overpriced and varying in quality. The place was absolutely heaving (Friday night and we hadn't booked anywhere), but we were kindly shown to a table so long as we vacated by 9pm. No problem, and we were happy that we were accommodated. \n\nThe restaurant, hot damn, I have never been in a place so noisy that I can't hear myself talk. It was full to the brim and just seemed that the acoustics were nicely setup to cause a constant sound of bedlam. I literally couldn't hear half of what the SR was saying, and we lapsed into silence for most of the meal. It felt rushed, with someone coming past our table every few minutes, asking us for an order, or delivering up food. For drinks, I had a very average Merlot (only two reds for sale by the glass, so options limited), and the boy knocked back a couple of lemonades. \n\nThe boy and I shared fish cakes and popia. The popia were nicely stuffed, more filling than batter, and the fish cakes were pleasant. We followed this up with duck with choo chi and pad prig ti dumm (monkfish, king prawns and scallops). I had thrown caution to the wind and gone for one of the pricier options on the menu, but the lightly spiced monkfish sounded too delicious. \n\nAnd this was where the problem was, it wasn't delicious. It was nice. It wasn't spicy - flavoursome and nicely cooked (scallops were pretty close to tender), yes, but not spicy and the flavours, well, they just weren't very elegant or interesting. The SR seemed to enjoy his duck, but in the same, deflated, 'oh, is that it?' kind of way. My dish also had some random squid that I didn't really want in there as well. We had ordered some pad mee on the side - which had the consistency of super noodles - and some roti. The more I ate, the more I realised I didn't want to. When the waiter came round to start emptying our table i.e. push all the remaining noodles onto our plates - I said no. I also don't like having someone else serving food onto my plate. So instead, all the food was heaped onto the SR's plate. It didn't exactly give me the option to return for more noodles later.\n\nOverall, it felt rushed and we didn't really enjoy our meals. To be honest, it overall came out as feeling all very average. Average food, average wine. Service - too hassled and rushed - by the time the main course arrived my stomach was in knots and I was feeling pretty anxious - not relaxed at all. Surroundings are way way way too noisy - need to seriously dampen acoustics in there - and price was seriously excessive of quality. In all honesty, I think this is the first Thai restaurant I've visited where I've been disappointed, and that's a shame - I can't think of a point where Dusit really scored well, bar some well cooked scallops and that really isn't enough to inspire me to return.",1

review_614176,restaurant,"On the positive side, our server was phenomenal. Michael went above and beyond to create our dining experience. Second and last positive is the reasonably priced wine and decent selection. The food is good, we did not have a bad dish. Our table of 6 ate tapas style and ate a wide variety from the edamame (delicious chili sauce) to the wagu beef. Unfortunately this is challenging because the portions are so small. Although they encourage tapas sharing, the dishes are barely appropriate for 2 to share. The food did not rock my world, but it was good. Then the bill came. For a table of 6 to spend $1,000 including gratuity, I would expect to be eating Nobu quality food. I have no problem paying for a meal that is outstanding, once in a lifetime experience. Unfortunately, that is not Baku in Southpark. Outrageously priced food.  Unfortunately we will not be back. Ever.",1
review_634769,restaurant,"Hold the dirty sauce & the sourdough. Okay, let me explain. So I went with the wife and we got two different sandwiches. I got the Bear Hug on sourdough and she got the Thunderbird on the dutch-crunch. The Thunderbird comes with thunderbird sauce. It is so good, you could taste all the parts; pastrami, gouda, & thunderbird sauce. The thunderbird sauce has a little kick to it, which is why I prefer it. And now let us discuss the dutch-crunch bread, it is a little sweet so the thunderbird sauce goes on that sandwich in perfect harmony. \n\nThen we get to my sandwich. :-( The sourdough was great and I am sure the dirry-sauce is good (I had already got blown away by the thunderbird sauce) but the sandwich has way to much going on in it. Roast beef, jalapeno poppers, lettuce, & some other yummy stuff in there I can't even remember. \n\nBecause they will pretty much make any kind of sandwich you want, I want to try meatball, gouda, lettuce, with thunderbird sauce on dutch-crunch bread. I believe it will be \""out of this world\"". In fact Ike, here's a new sandwich and title for you.\n\nOne sandwich can pretty much fill two normal appetites up. Unless you are like me, a ravenous creature. Get one and share ot get one for two-three meals. \n\nThis place is overwhelming, but a must. The staff is great two.

review_497376,restaurant,"We stumbled upon The Herb Box while walking around in old town, the patio space looked amazing and the menu was good so we stopped in. It was about 7:30 on a Saturday but they sat us right away. Off the bat it seemed like we were in for a great night, but once seated the night took a turn.\n First, we waited for at least 15 minutes for our waiter to even come over and take our drink order. It was clear he was overwhelmed because he asked to take our drink and food order at the same time. Not my favorite way to start what is suppose to be a romantic dinner. It took another 10 or 15 minutes to get the drinks we ordered and then we didn't see our sever again until half an hour after that when we got our food. It seemed like an exceptionally long wait to not be offered another drink.\nThe my food was delicious, I had the enchiladas the large salad that came on the side was a great compliment. My husband had the ribeye, he ordered it medium rare and it came out pretty much bloody, it took the waiter about 10 minutes to come back and check in us, at that point my husband sent the steak back in to the grill. The server was really kind about this but then brought the steak back without a fork to eat it with, having learned by this point, I asked for a fork before he left our table and it still took 5 minutes to get it. \nToward the end of the night our server chatted us up about beer and pot and chochella. We were down to talk, but him steering the convo toward pot because we are from CO was slightly unprofessional. \nOverall it seems like this place could be great if they polished the customer service and the attention to detail. I get that you are busy but as a customer I never want to feel your stress.",2

review_534391,restaurant,"Cute little cafe that is close to home and was very good!  My husband and I decided to try it for breakfast, we had heard about their version of red velvet pancakes and thought it might be good.\n\nThe service was great, but then there was only one other table.  We got the red velvet pancakes and the lemon ricotta pancakes.  I love the idea of a sweet cream cheese frosting.  I do agree with my husband, the lemon ricotta needed a little bit more lemon flavor but overall, it was good.\n\nThe menu is simple and has some interesting lunch items.  I think it's worth a trip back to check it out.",3
review_415708,restaurant,"Wings or prime rib?  Those are probably the two most common choices at this 24 hour restaurant located at the casino level of the Hooters Casino Hotel. The prime rib special is $9.95 all day and you can order 25 cents hot wings with a minimum order of ten from midnight until 6 AM.  The restaurant used to be Dan Marino's and quotes and images of the former NFL Miami Dolphins star quarterback are still a big part of the restaurant's d\u00e9cor.  Apparently, the recent name change to Mad Onion Fine Foods and Spirits occurred just before Thanksgiving 2009.  \n\nFrom a distance both specials looked decent, but I made a middle-of-the-night mistake by ordering their half pound Classic Mad Onion Burger.  The unique thing about the Mad Onion burger is having your choice of onions put on your burger.  I chose \""carmalized\"" onions among the list which also included raw onions, sauteed onions, BBQ onions and chipotle onions.  The burger comes with fries also.\n\nAt least the fries were hot in temperature because the burger was not.  The food took an excruciating amount of time to come out of the kitchen and when it finally did not only was the burger just warm but the carmalized onions were ice cold.  The half pound sirloin burger did not taste like fresh beef either.  It was a bit too ground up in texture and had a peculiar taste.  I think I made the right decision by tossing most of my food and making a run up to a 24 hour Wendy's at a nearby food court instead.\n\nThe Mad Onion staff were nice though, but this place is avoidable.",1
review_368341,restaurant,"We ordered from them for the first time using eat24hours.  The delivery time says 45-60 min and it took every second of 60 minutes for them to get here (even though we live only about 5 min away).  We ordered their Thai Egg Rolls, Pad Thai (Chicken/Hot), and Spicy Fried Rice (Chicken/Very Hot).  The flavor of the food was good, but the quality was just okay.  Since it took so long for them to deliver (although I should mention that it was a Friday, so that might be why), the food was cold.  I would say that the quantities of the food wasn't as liberal as some of the other places that we have been to here in Vegas and the prices were roughly the same.  I think that if you're in the area and are going out to eat somewhere casual, this might be an okay place to try, but if you're going to be ordering out/delivery I would try somewhere else.",1
review_452457,drinks,"Meh.\n\nMy standards for quality froyo are high since I frequent Yogurtology (Shea and Scottsdale), Yogurtland (I'm the Duke in Scottsdale), and sometimes I go to Mojo in Tempe. \n\nThis place has \""ok\"" flavors. I had the original tart, that was quite a bit tart. The toppings are ok. My friend really liked the fact that they have banana chips, but that's because we usually eat our froyo at home and we were far away from home, and she didn't have to use her personal stash. \n\nSince it made her happy, I gave this place an extra star. I'm cool like that.\n\nHmm...let's see. They have a snow machine. Not really sure what this is for. It seems out of place. \n\nIt's far from my house, and not really worth my drive. I guess if it was by my house, and I had no other options, I'd frequent this business. \n\nThis is the one time, and one time only that I will say this.....Thank God, I live in Old Town Scottsdale.",1
review_63037,others,"Look, if you're looking for an uber fancy \""Wynn type\"" resort, this is not your spot.  If you're looking for comfortable beds, clean rooms and friendly staff? You found your place.\n\nIt is more of a locals hang out.  It has it's up's and downs like any place.  But overall, as long as you stay in the Tower, the rooms are decent for the price & the place is nice.  It's not a huge casino, so you don't end up lost for hours trying to find your bank of elevators.  The food is good and decently priced.  The table dealers are all friendly and talkative, unlike those on the strip.  The smoking can be out of control but it's that way in most casino's.  Jack's Irish Pub is a great place to just go and hang out when you've had enough of the casino itself.  \n\nWhen I lived in Vegas, this is where I played.  Now when I visit, this is where I stay.   The only downside is that you do have to either rent a car or taxi if you want to leave.  They do shuttle to the Strip but being an ex-local, I avoid the Strip at all costs, so it doesn't bother me much.",3

I asked him why it was red, and he told me that it was supposed to look like that and it was probably just the lights. It tasted terrible and he didn't offer to remake it. I order old-fashions frequently and I have never got anything so weird, I thought it was a standard drink that bartenders knew.",0

review_288823,drinks,"If I could give this place more than five stars I would, I mean I really would. It is just that good! (Is anyone as excited as me about the completion of their renovations?) \n\nThis place has some of the best beer on the planet, you may not find that your particular beverage of choice is on tap, but just like food, beer is seasonal. For me it is all about their belgians...strong, tasty, and ultimately dangerously tasty. For those who simply can't decide where to begin, they have sampler platters available. \n\nAlso, they have some of the most hard-working bartenders I have ever seen here! They must have type caffeine+ blood because they just don't stop. Don't hesistate to ask a kind question, they will let you know everything about that beverage while simultaneously pouring you a sample and straightening your tie. \n\nThey also offer some good, simple dishes here at very reasonable prices. Pizzas are great because they are so shareable and always have such fresh and unusual ingredients, although they offer soup and sandwiches as well...\n\nWith beer this good you could serve it to me in a leaky basement and I would still give this place five stars! (Of course their facilities are impeccably clean and lovely!) Drink beer here; this is all you really need to know.",4
review_582798,beauty,"I went there for the first time two weeks ago for a full set. I read these reviews (which are mixed), and thought I'd try it out. Plus, they have a big sign outside that says, \""$14.99 for a full set \"" Good deal, I thought. Well, the place has a musty smell. Not your normal acrylic smell. There wasn't any wait. Tony did my nails. I also got a pedicure. The next day, my pinky nail popped up. It was hanging off and had torn my natural nail. I had to rip the rest of it off bc it was bleeding. The next day,  I went to get it fixed. Tony told me he wouldn't fix it bc it was bleeding and may become infected. He asked me to come back. So I did....yesterday. I needed a fill and wanted my pinky fixed for free since it popped up the day after I got the full set. Tony had the nerve to tell me that I \""hit\"" something and it wasnt his fault that it broke. How can you tell me what I was doing for it to break?  He wanted to charge $5 extra for this. Normally,  I'd think this is reasonable. But bc I went back and showed him my nail AND it happened right after I got the fullset, you'd think he would've bit the bullet and accepted it. So I got up and left and told him I wouldn't be back. He callously said, \""Bye.\"" I could've caused a scene and become very ignorant. But I think that writing this review is better. This will let ppl know what type of place this is and more importantly, the ppl who work there. I have a MAJOR problem with ppl in the service industry that aren't cordial, especially since my money goes to paying their bills. He didn't even seem to care about losing a customer.

review_646976,restaurant,"Japanese tapas! I've been waiting for this place to open for weeks...my friends and I went on a Friday night and were immediately greeted and seated.  It's really urban inside, with traditional Asian accents.  The ropes separating the tables are a unique touch.\n\nOur sever was super friendly and informed us that they were still \""soft opening\"", and let us know that they hadn't yet gotten their full inventory in, but would be continually adding new and exotic options in the future.  Beer was almost all Japanese and I couldn't resist Sapporo on draft.  They have a large sake list and I will definitely try some next time.\n\nEverything is family-style, meant to be shared, so you can feel free to try something you've never had before (Takoyaki, or octopus balls, WOW) and not feel like you committed to something you may not like.  We had takoyaki, beef wrapped enoki mushrooms, gyoza, and Tonkatsu (pork broth) ramen, and it was so insanely good...like, REALLY good.  It comes out randomly, but that's part of the fun.

I found a bunch of white gloves for 75 cents each after my discount and four skiens of white yarn, which I can always use, for a couple dollars.

The sushi rolls were basic to say the least.  You could buy the same exact roll at the market for a 1/4 of the price.  \n\nAlthough they do have an extensive sake menu, no amount of sake would help the feeling of being ripped off.",0
review_537282,entertainment,"Well, went back here to watch one of the NCAA semifinals. On Saturday night an entire section of the bar was reserved for a kids baseball team and their parents. Is this a sports bar or a Chucky cheese? Thought that was kinda lame. I only mention that because as we were sitting at the bar eating our $2 garlic parmesan fries (which had a nice amount of garlic on sturdy frozen steak fries) we noticed the big TV at the bar was very blurry. Yes, we were seeing double on that TV, so we had to move, but 1/2 the bar was off limits. Blurry TV..uhhh get it fixed. \n      The drink specials and beers here are always good, but food is still kinda shaky. As a sports bar, how can you not have mozzarella sticks or potato skins on the menu? My friend ordered the $7.95 BBQ chicken dinner, but this isn't BBQ, the breast is off the bone and then they simply cover the chicken with a bottled? BBQ sauce. So, it's technically  BBQ chicken, wink, wink, but real BBQ chicken is on the bone and actually gets sauced while cooking. My entree was way more successful as I had the Orchard salad with blackened chicken added for $2.95, which made this salad about $12. The chicken is this dish was outstanding, a great version of the blackened seasonings. My request for dressing on the side was ignored, so I just ate it anyway and the raspberry vinagarette, which the waitress said was homemade, wasn't too sweet afterall. Alot of tasty walnuts and dried cranberries appeared as well. \n    Waitress and follow-up guy server were very attentive and nice and I thank the management for sending me a gift card which I used to fun most of the meal.",2

It's apparent why the President stayed here for his first overnight stay after the inauguration.\n\nChef Cairns at Prado is exceptional - the food was on par with the best I've had in traveling six continents of the world for work and for fun.\n\nWe had a fantastic time here and would recommend it to anyone.

review_605262,restaurant,"I tell you...I need to do a better job in 2014 taking care of some of my bookmarks.  I've had SkinnyFats bookmarked ever since I read Amanda M and Nelson Q's review back in July. The gf even told me about this place and wanted to go.  She made it, I didn't.  But now I'm here. \n\nSo if you read the other reviews, then you get the gist of what SkinnyFats is all about.  They have a \""Healthy\"" side and a \""Happy\"" side.  Obviously, the \""Happy\"" side is your higher calorie options while the \""Healthy\"" side is for those trying to clean it up.  There's a selection here for everyone, which makes this place a must try at least once.  But a place like SkinnyFats may not be for everyone.   First of all, the Healthy side isn't super clean.  It's just clean for eating out.  As for their \""Happy\"" side, it's higher calorie but not crazy high.  \n\nAs a first-timer, I decided on getting something on the \""Healthy\"" side. What I get? I got their Healthy Juan Wrap, which consisted of egg whites, chicken breast, black beans, turkey sausage/bacon, brown rice, cilantro yogurt, cheese and pico all wrapped in a whole wheat tortilla.  When I ordered this bad boy, I was told that the Juan had 3 egg whites and 6 oz. of chicken.  My goodness, this has to be 50+ grams of protein.  Sweet..this takes care of two meals for me.  I loved my order.  I know it's a wrap, but to me this tasted like a healthier version of huge breakfast burrito.  I killed it and left SkinnyFats satisfied.  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=GolhEXzqrzu1AthjhU7RFQ&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ\n\nNow for the ambiance.  SkinnyFats is one popular and tiny restaurant.  I say popular because the lines made it outside.  This place gets crazy and loud.  And because it gets so busy around noon, our orders took some time.  So take my advice, SkinnyFats is a place to try, but not around lunch time.\n\n\n\n\nPS:  I'm sure that I will be back.  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=gqksGYp585yrpB2re-gq0w&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ",3

Ten bucks might have been fair since it was a little larger than, say, Papa Johns or Pizza Hut pizzas- but it didn't even taste that great.  It wasn't bad by any means but it was definitely forgettable.\n\nThey did have very nice employees and at least they weren't cheap on the toppings.

review_266623,restaurant,"My dad and I stopped in here one night after taking a cooking class nearby.  It looked interesting and had a good menu.  Besides, we are always up for Mexican food.  Having never heard of Frank and Fina's previously I had no expectations going in.  I leave feeling full but not fully satisfied.  To start, the chips and salsa were alright.  Crisp chips and generic salsa that tastes more of tomato than anything else.  Sure, I ate it by the bowl full but that does not mean it was an outstanding example of what can be a magical accomaniment to a chip.  For dinner I ordered a classic two item combo with a taco and tamale and the obligitory rice and beans.  The rice was good and the beans were refried.  I much prefer black beans to refried pintos but that is just me.  The taco I had was ipressive loaded with flavorful and tender meat.  It dripped half way down my arm towards my elbow.  That is the measure of a good taco.  As for the tamale, the flavor was alright and the ratio of meat to maza was fine.  it was the texture that threw me.  The maza was too smooth and seemed over processed.  I am used to a grittier form of maza.  I guess this isn't my favorite place to get Mexican food.",2

After reading other reviews I walked over to the sushi bar and looked at the day's specials.  We ordered two types of Nigiri off the special board and then Uni and Spicy Scallops.  For my nephew we got a spicy tuna roll.  There was nothing wrong with any of it.  The sushi had a clean taste and was very good.  It was a pleasant surprise.\n\nThe teppan started with a decent soup and salad.  The show itself was good, not great.  The portions of the meats were astonishing, absolutely huge.  Same with the veggies.  The rice was good and came in the standard cup.  A little odd was that the rice and veggies were an add on for an additional $3.  Not a big deal but just different.  Overall all the meats and the shrimp were okay.  I took a piece of my husband's steak as Teppan steak I always feel has the best flavor for steak from my perspective as a non steak eater, and it tasted like typical steak.\n\nSo basically the whole food experience was a standard.  Nothing really standing out, nothing bad.  On the other side was the service.  Lackadaisical is the word that comes to mind.    My sister said she felt she bussed our table.  Since our party of 4 was alone at the teppan table we kept passing her our dishes to put on the other end as not one thing was removed from the table.  Think about the number of items I mentioned having and how many dishes that means!  I had to ask to get water and tea refills and my glasses were removed and returned in the most bizarre way.  A pitcher could have been so much simpler.  It took a good 15 minutes for my sister's beverage to come from the bar.  It was almost an hour before the teppan chef came over.  \n\nThe server though was personable enough that the non-service service was less irritating than it might have been in other circumstances.  I doubt I will be back, but it wasn't a bad experience and for someone in the Ahwatukee area i would say if they have time and don't have a ton of money to spend on Teppan or sushi it is not  a bad choice.",2
review_525060,others,"Had to give this place a try the prices were on the expensive side but i guess since it's sushi and other food i guess that's Vegas for you lol. Although i didnt get sushi. I ended up getting the bento box 3 which was one choice of chicken , rice, spam and fried noodles which all portions were just right for me. Although everything else is pricey i would indulge in this place again. Oh and the bonus as i was checking in on this place with yelp on my iphone a coupon popped up for here for 15% of entire bill so i asked and showed the coupon to the waiter and he said yes he'll take 15% off sweet I love Yelp!!",3

review_208267,entertainment,"I had the fortunate chance to score some really great tickets through my cousin,  and I mean really great.  The seats were amazing, really close the stage....a bit to the left (when facing the stage), and just 7 rows back from the Orchestra.  I didn't realize how large the actual theatre was until the end of the show where I had the opportunty to look back.  And it's pretty big.\n\nThe sets were amazing, and perhaps even easier to appreciate considering the closeness of the seats.  They were lively and almost always moving that I guess it also helped make the performance move along nicely.  I particularly found the chandelier piece and the sides of the theatres amazing and definitely adding to the set decor and beauty of the stage.\n\nThe performance itself was really great, condensed, but great.  I never knew that that the Broadway shows in Vegas were meant to be shorter than their normal run-time.  Someone once said it's because people out here have shorter attention spans.  I think it's just more to prevent people from being out of the casinos for too long.  Afterall, it is Vegas.",3
review_102974,restaurant,"So I made it in to this charming restaurant today, and had to order the famous Stetson salad, and yes, it was very good. Personally, I actually preferred the Testosterone salad, and I think that salad doesn't get nearly enough play. The steak strips were like a little piece of carnivore heaven. So tasty, juicy, and ridiculously tender. Prices were a bit steep. 50 bucks for 2 salads, a glass of wine and an iced tea. Regardless of price, next time I go, I'm SO ordering a big juicy steak. \nGreat people-watching spot right in Old Town, and the place had cute character. \nNice place to take visitors from out of town.",3
review_44337,drinks,"I went back recently with a friend for happy hour. We were excited to have some sushi and enjoy a drink on this nice night. We were told that there were no tables outside available for happy hour except for high tops, where we could seat ourselves. As we walked over to the high top table area, we passed at least one open table in the happy hour section (for which we weren't even offered to wait). Our server brought us menus, waters, and then disappeared. When she finally came back, my friend ordered a blushing geisha. After that, the waitress left and over the next 25 minutes, frequently checked on her other tables around us, but ignored us completely. Finally, after getting her attention, she took our food order. I asked for a sample of a red wine, and the glass came out filthy and unpolished. When our food arrived, the server took our edamame before we had finished them. We also had to ask for soy sauce (the dispenser was empty), wasabi and ginger. \n\nI was really shocked, because RA has such a good reputation. Needless to say, this server did not get a good tip, and the only reason I will return is because I am particularly fond of one of their happy hour items.",1
review_409928,shopping,"I love Greenland market! It is an excellent Korean-owned asian grocery store and carries a lot of varied products. \n\nTheir fresh meat selection is awesome. Everytime my Mom is in town I always make a trip to Greenland to stock up on Korean-style short ribs so that she can marinate them (and so that I can have a freezer full of Mom's delicious bulgogi short ribs nom nom nommm).\n\nThe prepared foods section is very good too. I have had jobchae, kimchee, kimbop and seaweed salad from there.\n\nThe food court is perfect for when you need a quick bite before grocery shopping, knowing that if you walk in to Greenland hungry you will end up buying everything in the store. My favorite food court item is the mussel champong (spicy seafood and noodle soup) from the stand in the corner, the name escapes me. So yummy.\n\nBe sure to get your Greenland Market rewards from the cashier. For every $500 you spend, you get a $10 coupon/voucher to use towards future purchases.",4

However, a friend and I stopped in late the other night after helping him move in to his new place right down the road. \nWe walked in and were graciously greeted by a few friendly employees. We did some light shopping. About a half a cart full when a lady stopped us. \""Sir dogs aren't allowed in the store. You need to take him out!\"" little did she know, my friends dog is a service dog. I don't know if she wasn't paying attention to the large green service jacket that his dog was wearing or if she was just being ignorant. \n\nMy friends has some minor disabilities, they arnt to obvious. But I didn't know that should be anyone ones business. My friend got extremely embarrassed and as he started explaining to me what else he needed and getting his wallet out to hand me his card. She began to harass him. Speaking loudly and sternly \""you need to get out of the store, NOW!\"" \""NOW!\"" \n\nTo a person with autism, everything feels exaggerated times 100%. My autistic friend started to panic. I attempted to calm him down when I explained to the lady that it was a service dog and showed her his jacket. then questioned me like I was lying. By now my poor disabled friend was sent in such a panic that  he kept whispering to me that \""the police were going to come and arrest him\""\nI felt so bad that we left our cart in the middle of the aisle. And left the store with out purchasing anything. \n\nI couldn't believe how ignorant this lady was.

The jambalaya was gross, as was the other pasta/sausage dishes. The lobster pan roast was ok, but didnt finish half of it, had a weird consistency but was similar to a lobster bisque. Wouldnt order that again either. Please note, you have to allow 1.5 to 2 hrs to eat here b/c the service is always super snail slow...even for regular customers.",2

It's time to end the night, but not before a nice hot bowl of PHO. \n\nBut wait, we are in the middle of the Vegas strip and there's no PHO restaurants nearby  - none that I'm aware of at least. So what do you settle for? \n\nI almost felt like I hit the jackpot when I saw RAMEN on this Cafe's menu.

What was I thinking ordering Ramen at a cafe. I've had better instant ramen from 7-11. Ramen was topped off with chicken breast, some green onions and carrots. CARROTS! yes CARROTS - It's totally wrong!. Broth tasted like it came from a Campbell can. \n\nI'm giving it 2 stars because I only sampled the ramen.

review_182476,restaurant,"Good food, but sneaky waiter. The food was pretty good, but the service left a bad taste in my mouth. We ordered an appetizer, side, and two entrees. After ordering our entrees, the waiter asked these three words, \""Soup or Salad?\"" The question seemed to imply that either would be included with the entree. We smiled and both chose soup and were greeted at the night's end with a charge of two bowls of soup. Wonderful.  \n\nUpon receiving the bill, I asked the waiter, who we will call 'Trey', why we were charged for the soups. He said, that he asked Soup or Salad for our benefit, because it's his job as the server to make it easier for us to decide. Hmm...since when did this place begin employing used car salesmen? Sorry Trey, but I had to stiff you on the tip, because of what you did.\n\nI guess we should've smelled something 'fishy' when we first arrived. Our original plan was to dine in the top floor at the 'fine dining' portion of the restaurant and order two 5 course prix-fixe for $95 each, which is currently advertised on RM Seafood's website. When we arrived and were given menus, the lowest priced option was a 3-course for $115. The waiter said that, it was probably an outdated special from when they first opened. False advertising....  \n \nPlease watch out for hidden fees, cause these people are sneaky. The water is $5. Just from sitting in the 'fine dining' section for a few minutes, we could tell that the place was extremely old fashioned, stodgy, and cold.",0

review_38188,others,"Pros: Location, location, location...can't beat sitting next to a beautiful lake (albeit fake) and enjoy the weather and the ducks. They have Wi-Fi.\n\nCons: Coffee is ok nothing special.   You only get a cup of hot water and a tea bag if you ask for tea, they don't brew it or boil the water.  One of my pet peeves here is that they have hardly any food!  It's the same crap every week, baklava and other really sugary things.  Wish they had sandwiches or some real food besides sweets. If you wanna enjoy the ducks and lake there is a good chance you will also be enjoying someone else's smoke.  This can get annoying quickly specially if you have a whole table that's smoking next to you or if someone has cigars. If you go early in the mornings you tend to avoid these people.\n\nService?  It depends who you get.  Most of the staff is pretty cool and mellow, the owners on the other hand can sometimes be abrupt and some what rude.  They don't like you hanging around for too long.  As for the Wi-Fi, I went in once bought a latte and some cake thing and asked for a WI-Fi connection # (you need it to log into their network).  I sat down with my laptop and iphone and realized  I was going to need another Wi-Fi connection # cuz I was planning on updating my iphone while I was there and they make you get a # for each device.   I immediately went back to the line and asked the girl for another Wi-Fi connection # at which point she told me I would have to spend at least another $3 in order for her to give it to me since that was their policy.  I had just spent $7 for that coffee and stupid sweet thing  so as far as I could see I had met their policy.  A lady in line with her husband agreed with me since she remembered me being in line ahead of her and told the girl to just give me her # since she didn't think they were being reasonable either.\n\nThis place has a lot of potential and they would get a higher rating from me if they would address some of these issues.",1

The kids and I really enjoyed the animatronic animals, the inside rain, waterfall and lightning strikes and thunder.   Our services was average.  It was really nice that grandma's wheel chair fit nicely under the table and was comfortable. We really enjoyed the total experience.",2
review_338102,housing,"Check-in couldn't have been simpler buy parking was a pain. Apparently the hotel lot (underground) is tiny and my grand caravan had to be parked up the hill, 4 blocks away in a public lot for $20/day... I would have appreciated clear instructions from the front desk... I mean they gave me a map to the parking lot but no indication that it was public, outdoor and needed to be paid for...\n\nOur 2-bedroom suite was spacious and clean although somewhat dated. The living room and kitchen were great and the balcony looked nice (the -30 windchill make the balcony a spectator sport only). The bedrooms were nice and big as well.\n\nThe beds and pillows are 2-3 stars at best. The beds were small queens and the mattresses were very firm (the kind a hotel guys to avoid having to replace them regularly). The pillows were small and too squishy (bed too firm, pillows too soft... I was having a goldilocks moment...).\n\nOverall this hotel does provide a great location at a great price and the amenities and decent.",3
review_324666,entertainment,"This is just ok it is close to where I live so I've been here a dozen or so times. There's a restaurant inside with drinks its gross the food is below average chain restaurant food overpriced and we had very poor service.\n\nThe theaters are relatively new good if you enjoy the awe of the big screen, and yes they have stadium seating, IMAX, 3d the works. But you are looking at some expensive tickets 15$ plus. Matinees in just plain theaters are reasonable.\n\nThey have some sort of VIP deal where even if they don't sell those seats you cannot sit in them unless you paid 20$ in certain theaters. Stupid.\n\nThen there's the bathrooms the last three times I've gone they have been DEEsgusting. Do not go in unless you bought that giant soda and you have to.\n\nSome shows sell out fast and will be crowded so plan ahead.",2
review_58898,others,"I absolutely love Capriotti's. I get the Capastrami everytime I come, it's simply delicious. That mountain of meat, cheese, dressing, and slaw. Oh and don't let me forget they have 20 inch subs. Yes that's 20 inches of deliciousness. Now overall I would give all other Capriotti's locations a 5 stars no question about it but I have had nothing but problems with THIS LOCATION the three times I have been here. The problems I have had everytime has been either with delivery or calling in my order for pickup.\n\nFirst experience: I found out they delivered so I ordered a 20 inch Capastrami with some other items for delivery to my apartment via their app at 6pm. The app said it would take about an hour and a half to get there, extremely long. I called the store out of curiosity about 20 minutes after placing my order just to verify everything. I get told they are not currently delivering as no one there owns a car, they deliver only from 12-4pm, and they did not recieve my order period. So why did the app let me order? That's an error on the owners behalf. If I didn't call the food would of never shown up without any notice. Seems like amatuer work to me. So I drive to the store and get my food. I arrive home and there is a delivery guy knocking on my door. Amatuer work at it's finest and terrible communication.\n\nSecond experience: I was at work and decided I would buy lunch for me and my partner as he has never had Capriotti's. I call and order a 20 inch Capastrami once again. The woman on the phone tells me I have to order over $30 for delivery. I don't know anywhere else that requires that much for a minimum. I tell her I didn't order $30 worth of items last week and got delivery to my apartment. She told me they don't deliver to apartments and basically called me a liar with her bitchy attitude. I asked to speak to her manager. A split second later she is back trying to disguise her voice. There is no professionalism with this staff. I hung up to prevent myself from saying some evil shit.\n\nThird experience: I order food for pickup and was told it would be ready in 15 minutes. So I drive there expecting my food to be ready just to find out they had not even started my order. I waited 20 more minutes just for the food. What is the point in taking orders if they will not be ready. \n\nIt sucks because this location does make it's sandwiches good which is the only reason it still got 3 stars and the guy who makes the subs is great. The rest of the staff is shit and needs to get trained on their systems. GET ON IT FRANCHISEE OWNER.\n\nI will not be returning to this location.",2
review_254403,others,"You know how everyone has that friend who says they LOVE Mexican food and when you ask what their favorite kind of Mexican food is, they say it's a toss-up between the Crunchwrap Supreme and Cinna-twists? These are the same people who like Pei Wei. Pei Wei is Asian food for people who hate Asian food but don't know they hate Asian food because they've literally never had Asian food except for Pei Wei. Even Panda Express is more authentic than Pei Wei. Man, Pei Wei is just so bad. \n\nI've been to Pei Wei before. I am never expecting authentic Asian food (I'm not a fool), but I am disappointed EVERY TIME I GO. Their menu just looks so enticing, and then you get the food and it's SO bland and boring EVERY SINGLE TIME. That's why they get 3 stars. Maybe I was exaggerating a bit before when I said they were \""so bad\"", because they're not BAD-bad in the sense that their food sucks. They're just regular-bad in the sense that their food is NOT GOOD... EVER. \n\nI went there on 8/20/14 and ordered the Korean steak lettuce wraps and their new Mango California Rolls. I'm not usually a California roll type of girl, but they looked pretty good in the picture on the wall and I thought the mango-spin sounded like it had potential. \n\nI am like 95% positive the \""Korean Steak\"" was ground beef with teriyaki sauce. Like, I'm pretty sure they just use the same teriyaki sauce on everything. I don't know how they're differentiating their \""Korean\"" style foods from their Thai/Japanese/Chinese foods, but then I realized.. wait, they just call it \""Korean\"" because they're like, \""Well, we already listed four other things as Thai and six other things as Japanese, so this one can just be 'Korean'. Yeah, that sounds good!\""\n\nI had four pieces of the Mango California Roll, only one of which had a sliver of mango in it. Meh, whatever. I was cool with it because turns out you can't taste the mango in it anyway. I absolutely do not recommend using the dipping sauce they give you with it though. Like, not even because I'm prejudice against Pei Wei. It was legitimately bad, like they need to stop serving it immediately. It was some weird Minute Maid orange juice, vinegar, soy sauce mixture and it was horrible. Did I get the recipe right though? Can someone who works at Pei Wei comment on this? I am pretty sure I'm at least close. Don't even try it!",2
review_276740,restaurant,"Ive been \""dragged\"" here twice. Im really surprised it has so many good reviews, but then again, people love crappy food. Fast food and chain restaurants are recession-proof. This place reminds me of chuckee cheese. I think the food is horrible, but its always crowded, mostly with people with tons of kids. The service is unspeakable, even if you have lowered expectations for a pizza place. Very dirty feel of the place. It smells like sewer inside, like that dirty steaming floor drain smell. The servers run around with dirty plates, money and fresh food all in one round, just throwing dirty plates in bus-tubs, and walking around. They serve 12 beers on tap, and red and white wine. The bartender was so incompetent it was embarrassing to even watch.  She was so awful, I cringed.",0

I fist saw it on the TV show The Opener where (somewhat) celebrity Chef David Adjey help these 3 sweet guys open their first restaurant. I can see that most of what they put on the menu remains today. \n\nSo I ordered the burger, and it was just boring. Like a burger from Chenoys would be. One of my friends had it as well and we felt exactly the same. There was some mystery meat on top of the patty, maybe bacon, but it was raw. My 3 other friends had the chicken and all thought it was real dry. Everything else about this joint was cool, the decor, waitresses, terrace, etc...\n\nI will give it another try when someone suggests it.

review_68327,restaurant,"BF went here years ago, and ever since we moved back, he's mentioned it every time we go out for Thai. We finally made it in this evening for dinner.\n\nThough it's located in a strip mall, the interior d\u00e9cor is quite nice, and the service was on point throughout our visit: attentive, polite, and professional. I was impressed before we even got to the food.\n\nStarted with the Fishcakes app- $8. Good portion for the price, cakes weren't too greasy and seemed meatier than others we've had. Herbs and seasonings were mixed into the patties, making them quite flavorful. The cucumber salad was also fresh and flavorful, perfectly complement to the cakes.\nShared the hotpot of tom kha kai soup- $12. Large hot pot serving is good for us, since we love this soup. First impression of the dish was that it was incredibly well balanced. The broth was super flavorful, and there was a good amount of chicken, mushrooms, onions, and cilantro in the soup itself.\nLastly, we split the duck curry entr\u00e9e- $14. As my BF put it, \""This is possibly the best curry I've ever had.\"" The duck was perfectly cooked, the curry sauce was amazing, and the pineapple and peppers worked well to bring the dish together. Portion was a good size, and came with a small side of white rice. The only change I might make to this dish would possibly be to add more veggies to it.\n\nAll in all, dinner with tip was just over $40 for two on a Friday night. Service was impeccable, food was flavorful and well balanced, and this is definitely a place I'd go back to- Vegas has a lot of good Thai restaurants, but this one has all of the elements to make it stand out as great.",3

The music sucks and is a weird mixture of pop, techno and house with about 10 seconds of hip hop mixed in. The drinks are ridiculously expensive. $10 for a Corona.

The first Osaka I ever visited was years ago near my house on Lake Mead/Rainbow which offered terrific service, great atmosphere and great sushi. However, I went back and that location changed. But this is the REVIEW for Osaka on Eastern now, so here we go. \n\nAfter a hard day of work we (8 people) went to Osaka's with reservations and were promptly seated at one of those tables (forgive my ignorance) where you take your shoes off and your legs hang under. Within seconds of ordering drinks they were already out and we were pouring Sapporo for everyone and a Tokyo Tea for one of the girls at the table. \n\nWe ordered a couple of appetizers, cooked dishes and sushi. More than enough food for the table! Everyone raved about how good the food was I tried everything. One of the rolls NOT on their menu is the virgin roll, make sure you give it a try.

review_53484,others,"We went for the exotic menu - buffalo, elk and ostrich offerings. We have been trying to stick with a moderately paleo diet and thought that these burgers might just work for us. I ordered the elk burger sans grill seasoning (contains gluten) without the bun. The menu states that the game is grass and grain fed, so I am not sure how closely this falls to our paleo needs but we figured it was close enough for a Friday night cheat meal. \n\nWhen the burgers were ready we hit the toppings bar and loaded up lettuce, onions, pico and pickles then made ourselves some burger wraps. I will admit the elk was not quite the medium well I requested, it was quite well done but that's ok. It also seemed to be very fatty considering it has \""lean\"" in the menu description. As I cut pieces off the fat cooled and congealed on my knife leaving a thick white coating of elk fat. \n\nFor the price I think next time I might just hit up Sprouts or the Meat Shop and get myself some truly grass fed meat and veggies to make wraps at home. But for a lazy night Fuddruckers does the trick.",2

This is only the second time my brother had been to a Cracker Barrel and he really enjoyed his burger. One thing I like is that Cracker Barrel, in the recent past, has added healthier options to their menu. I ordered an Apple BBQ chicken breast. Perfection. I also like that they let you pick and choose what sides you want with your meal. You can make it healthy or you can make it not-so-healthy. Their hash brown casserole is to die for, but it's something I stay away from. \nBig demerits: They were out of sweet potatoes and out of mixed vegetables.

review_565884,restaurant,"The other reviews are spot on. Sunday evening (about 6PM) Dawn and myself discovered Maverick Rock Taco by accident: we just happened to spot it while looking for something new.\nWe were seated in the bar area and promptly attended to by the bartender/ server for the table. He was very knowledgeable about the menu and made some excellent suggestions.\n\nWe had the salsa trio app (tomatillo/ avacado, Roja and mango/ habenero). The tomatilo/ avacado was exceptional. The Roja was a bit more bland than I like, but a dash of hot sauce opened up the flavor. There was no 'heat' to the sweet/heat of the mango/ habenaro ... perhaps the spice was left out of this batch?\nFor our entree we ordered six different proteins with a variety of toppings as tacos (chicken, steak, calamari, shrimp, vegetarian) IMPOSSIBLE to pick a favorite because they were all great: fresh, tasty and HUGE portions for the money.\n\nThe only drawback (and it's a pretty big one) was the atmosphere on this particular evening. We were seated in the bar area (We weren't told there was another dining area, just seated in the bar.) and had just received our food when a young woman decided to pay the jukebox. The music blasted out a hip hop song full of profanity and explicit sexual content. The music was loud enough to restrict conversation. There was a table of young twenty somethings seated behind us and they were singing along at the top of their lungs. Yike. Remember, this is about 6PM on a Sunday night. A server told us later that they had been there since opening and drinking all day. That experience really threw a wet towel over the evening. \n\nWe'll be back, but only during lunch next time.",2

review_540788,restaurant,"Somewhat surprisingly, Charlotte has no shortage of Japanese steakhouses. if memory serves, there are three Kabutos, two Nakato, a couple other individual locations such as Fuji, Mai, Nikko and Musashi, and this is all within the Charlotte area. If you move out a bit you can find others, like Ichiban near Salisbury, and then you have Hibachi in most any Chinese buffet.\n\nAs such, Fujimi isn't that unique. But it is the closest to our house, and that is helpful, because if we don't want to drive, it makes for convenience, and that is important. Also, the staff is friendly, and the food is solid.\n\nAt many Japanese steakhouses you can also find sushi, and Fujimi is no exception. The quality is not quite as good as some other places, so it probably isn't the place to go strictly for sushi, but if you want a quick roll with your meal, it will certainly do in a pinch.",3

review_74866,restaurant,"The third piece of the trilogy - read my other reviews - is this microbrewery-turned-church, the last one of my three most favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh. With Catholic background and dwindling population and culture, Pittsburgh has lots of old church buildings that are converted into a completely new venue. One of the other places is called Sanctuary, which is a three-story club now, and it's quite awesome inside. This place, when you walk in, imposes the brew house that's sitting where the altar used to be. Above the setup it has a Latin phrase that went something like \""our god, eternal light...\"", and the angels flying around in the stained glasses are smiling down on you with bottles in their hands. I don't know what will happen to the religious state of mind if a devout Christian walks in here. Maybe it will explode. But I think it's awesome that instead of tearing this structure down they decided to add a spin to the place and make a great use out of it. It's part of the memory of the community - not that I was part of the specific neighborhood, but still - and you should be able to live with the changing times and at least be thankful that most part of what the church used to be is still providing people shelter and utility.\n\nAnyways, back to more important matters. The setup makes you feel you're at an indoor beer garden. The echoing of chitter-chatters are somewhat unique because there's no church music or bar music playing in the background. So imagine you're a monk and you step into the dining area of your monastry, except you're in the 21st century. Food: excellent, the large pizzas are quite massive and massively tasty so be prepared to share it with at least one other people (two guys should share one, or three girls, or four kids... you get the idea). I think the pizza guy Their other food was also great. Beer: fantastic. The most memorable one was their dark ale, which they roast the malt enough so that the color is darker and the flavor is, duh, roasty, and grainy. I wonder if they sell their bottled beers in other states too. Again, I miss you too. I'll be back someday.",4
review_107700,restaurant,Wasn't fantastic. Definitely overpriced for what it was... service was horrible.... we were the ONLY people in there and it took forever... would we go back? \n\nNope.,1
review_142158,others,Fake Japanese by Korean. They don't even serve Japanese green tea. Always run out of Uni during lunch hour. What a coincidence.\nWeird rules to limit you from eating what you like to eat. They wrap everything with a lot of rice and force you to finish them before next dish. The wait in between well make you out of appetite directly. It's full of craps. Next one..,0
review_208035,drinks,"One Monday night, we came to Triple George after a nice happy hour on Fremont East.  I was excited to try this spot as it's been getting a bunch a great reviews.  Also, I'm ALWAYS looking for a new place to Yelp :)\n\nThis place is pretty spacious!  Dark wood panels with a HUGE bar.  It practically goes the length of the entire place. Then, when you pass the bar, you think it's over and then there's another room in the back with more dining tables.  Great space.  \n\nI don't remember our servers name, however, she was a little interesting.  She had a soft voice and a loud voice.  The soft voice came across with a slight English accent and the loud voice was straight American accent.  I thought maybe it was me, but then the entire party of 6 said the same thing!  Maybe it was a trick, however, not really funny.  Just plain weird!\n\nFor my meal, I asked another server for any beer specials and he brought me a list of $3 beers!  WOW, I was sooo happy and drank a few Miller Lites that night.  I also had the Calamari appetizer for $8.95.  The calamari was lightly breaded and cooked great.  It wasn't rubbery at all.  My only rant: It needed salt.  No flavor!  The marinara sauce was warm and a great compliment to the breaded flavor.  \n\nOk, now the really bad part.  When the bill came, I found out all my beers weren't $3 at all.  The menu that was passed to me by another server was a beer specials list for Mob Bar next door.  First off, I thought they were connect since there's a door leading to the bar that was open.  And of course, why would a Triple George server give me a Mob Bar menu without telling me.  It didn't make sense.  When I brought it to the attention of our \""British\"" server, the American accent came out and corrected me.  Although funny, I wasn't buying her spiel.  Not a good impression.\n\nThis bar is close to the action, yet far away, if that makes sense.  I'm not going to line up here again, but I also wouldn't mind revisiting, if given the opportunity.  Maybe my next visit will be better!",2

review_167969,restaurant,"I thought the food was great! My wife had the amazing filet mignon which was divine and my steak was excellent. They give you an outrageous portion of French fries, good thing they are delicious. I thought it was a pretty classy place with good service. Way too long of a wait to sit outside. The window was just as nice to sit by plus no cigarette smoke from people outside.",3
review_299378,drinks,Happy hour makes this a good find.  They have a big margarita for six bucks.  Not bad.  Good flavor definitely not watered down.\n\nI gravitate towards the Jack Daniels menu items.  The ribs are 4 out 5 stars and they salads are definitely worth a look.,3
review_361967,restaurant,"My group had a lovely table at the window with a very nice Italian waiter.  \nWe ordered a bottle of the St. Michelle Riesling - one of the best I've had!\nI ordered the Yellowtail Tuna Crudo - nice combination of citrus with each yellowtail bite but it didn't match anything else on the menu and Tagliatelle pasta - w/ truffle & duck egg, etc.  I should've known better because the pasta was super RICH and packed w/ flavor, maybe too much.  And for dessert, I ordered the Toffee Bread Pudding - it was good  but again should've known better it just made me feel even more disgustingly full.\n\nService was pretty good, but not a lot of menu options.  \nI was here the previous night for happy hour.  Interesting menu.  The burrata, almonds, and calamari were the best items on the menu.  The omelette was decent and I didn't try the spicy sausage.",2

Please believe I ate almost everything they had to offer for brunch however based on the flavor of the food I felt ripped off. It was just completely unsatisfying . However service is great, the atmosphere is beautiful and the people sexy. It's $38 for brunch plus $10 for unlimited Bloody Mary's. \n\nEat here for lunch or dinner order off the menu.

review_505258,restaurant,"Been here a handful of times, its hit or miss. The place is VERY pretencious and hipster-ish but on a normal day you can get a good bowl of pho. It is over priced compared to other more authentic places but the quality of  sliced beef in the pho is better then most places. They do pride them self on the variety of spring rolls they offer, which I found to be nothing special but not bad. So all in all its OKAY, plain and simple.",2
review_444317,entertainment,"Not a good activity for kids 6 - 7 years old.  This is primarily due to the fact that kids under 8 are not permitted to participate in dodgeball or play on the main trampolines without a chaperone.  We brought our son who is 7 1/2 and his friend who is 7.  Basically their only choices were to play in the 'little kids' are (where they had to avoid jumping on very small children) - or - stand in a long line, jump into a foam pit and get out.  One other attraction was closed, so I'm not sure what ages were permitted in that area.  Probably won't go back even when our son turns 8.",1
review_612034,restaurant,I dont even want to give this restaurant a single star...the service was terrible....we sent our food back not once but twice...and never ended up getting a meal...the manager didn't seem to concerned at how bad the food and service were...we will never ever be back and we would never recommend this to someone...can't imagine that they will be open very long,0

We will definitely be back.",4
review_205022,restaurant,"Boo.\n\nAlmost everything containing meat is dried out, overcooked, and over seasoned.  We had a $50 dining credit to use at MGM so I wasn't too upset that the buffet sucked since we didn't pay full price.  And I'm SUPER glad that kids 4 and under are free because this is a really kid-UNfriendly buffet.  No chicken tenders? No fries? Come on, kids live for that stuff! The fruit selection wasn't even very good, so our kiddo ended up eating cheese slices for dinner.\n\nNow, after that glowing review, you're gonna think I'm nuts when I say we went back for breakfast, and you would be right.  We had a long trek from tower 3 at The Signature at MGM Grand and we woke up late.  We were gonna try to hustle our booties over to anywhere but here, but we realized that if we walked we would miss it.  Oh well.  Breakfast was a little better, though, since they had more to offer.  But again, the meats were overcooked, dried out, and overseasoned.  OH WAIT! That's because they were serving the EXACT same things they served the night before!  This time, though, they added fluffy scrambled eggs that were weirdly wet for some reason, cheap bacon, and stale cereal.  My daughter did enjoy the pancakes and blueberries, and I enjoyed the time when it was time to leave.  Two stars - one for the friendly staff, and one for the pecan tart at the dessert station.",1
review_384210,housing,"I love living here.  They have valet only for guests, but residents have their own spots.  The amenities are basically everything you need.  The grocery stores are a couple miles away but it is a great location near the freeway.  The HOA is usually on top of things it seems.  They did just get a bunch of new security guards so there are some growing pains, but it seems smooth again.  They have to open the garage for you.  not a bad place to live.",3
review_111882,drinks,"Philly's is a great spot if you want to kick back with some good bar food and drinks.  I used to live in the apartments behind Philly's and would wall myself on over to post up at the bar.  Perfect.  Now I have moved further up into Scottsdale and still find myself posting up here.\n\nThey have a nice patio with the outside bar, TV's and of course misters!  The bartenders are always friendly and quick with service.  As far as food goes they actually have some pretty delicious bar food! Mozzarella sticks, potato skins, loaded fries, and the yummy wings!  They have that yummy creamy ranch that you could swish in your mouth.  Okay, that's a little overkill but it's really good. :)\n\nThey have good drink specials and if your order something that's not on special they will make a suggestion for what is (ie. Captain n' Coke, Sailor Jerry's n' Coke).  Everyone should appreciate that !\n\nDon't pass this place up.  Especially if you like watching sports at the bar, it's worth going here.  Don't expect anything fancy though, it is a laid back bar so plan to just enjoy yourself with friends or alone at the bar is fine too.",3

review_428904,shopping,I wish I could give 10 stars! This is such a wonderful place. The quality and service this store offers is absolutely amazing. The store is owned by a husband and wife team and they take such pride in their product. I didn't want to spend too much on a wedding dress but I really loved the Watters collection and they are the best location to go when searching for this designer. They were so helpful and treated me like a princess from the moment I stepped in the store. I was nervous to come b/c I knew that I wouldn't be spending as much as the typical bride and I didn't want to feel out of place. They made me feel sooooo incredibly comfortable and found me the perfect dress for $1200 off the price that it originally was. The assistant that they have working there is so sweet also. She is in fashion design school and had some great ideas to complete the look of my dress. My sister came here for when she was looking to get married 2 years ago and after that experience I knew that when it came my turn there was no other place I would want to go. They made the day really magical and I am so thankful for the professional and superior service. GET YOUR WEDDING DRESS HERE! YOU WONT REGRET IT!,4

review_369988,housing,"Well it's on the strip and near by mass transit and connections to the highway. The room was nothing special, standard cheap hotel beds, decor, and towels but nothing offensive either. Rates are a bargain though since this is an older hotel/casino and it is at the far end of the strip. \n\nIf you are coming to Vegas to enjoy the other sites and sounds, then this might be the hotel for you if you want to save a buck or two for something else. If you are expecting to lounge in the lap of luxury in your resting hours and enjoy some fantastic room service, head towards the center of the strip and some of the newer, better staffed, more opulent casinos. \n\nI will say though that they have a decent free trapeze show fairly regularly. I'd like to give this place 2 and a half stars but I don't think it merits a third.",1

The poor service wasn't limited to our table either. A gentlemen at the bar got a burger minus the actual burger.  Fries, bun, lettuce, tomato, no meat!  I have no clue how the dish made it out of the kitchen.  Our drink order took a good 15 minuets and our server forgot half of our orders. We ordered a few munchies which also took far too long. We had to request water, napkins, and silverwear. While our food sat waiting. Throughout our meal we never saw a manager to discuss our frustrations.  \n\nThe food was average. Weirderedchips and salsa, poratoe skins, calamari, chicken quesadilla. The chips were stale, salsa similar to store bought. Potatoe skins were poor. The calamari gets a B.

I ordered the special sirloin. I always get my steaks medium.

We really appreciated that and that really shows good customer service. HOWEVER, apparently they ALWAYS run out of the prime rib right around dinner time. That to me is poor service.

Zwischen dem Hotel und dem Serendipity die Wasserspiele und Springbrunnen, die von der Au\u00dfenterrasse wunderbar zu beobachten (und fotografieren) sind. Und zur anderen Seite das pulsierende Leben des Strip.\n (Siehe Foto unten) Gehobenes Burger Restaurant \n so kann man das Serendipity am besten beschreiben. Obwohl  es gibt nicht nur Burger, die gro\u00dfe Menukarte ist umfangreich und bietet auch jede Menge Pizzen, Omelets und andere Eiergerichte, dazu verf\u00fchrerische, gro\u00dfe Desserts  Eis, Cremes und sonstige Naschereien.\nIm Innenraum sind die Tische sehr eng gestellt, zu Essenszeiten ist es meist gerammelt voll und Gespr\u00e4chsf\u00fchrung kaum noch m\u00f6glich. Sch\u00f6ner ist es da schon auf der Au\u00dfenterrasse. Der Blick auf den direkt vor einem liegenden Strip ist lebendiges Kino. Und mit einem guten Teleobjektiv lassen sich von hier aus unbemerkt die kuriosesten Fotos schie\u00dfen. \nF\u00fcr Las Vegas Verh\u00e4ltnisse l\u00e4sst es sich preislich vern\u00fcnftig essen. Wir waren mehrfach hier und haben  nat\u00fcrlich, wenn schon dann schon  Burger getestet: A.B.C. Burger ($ 16+), BBQ & Blue Burger ($ 16+), B.E.C. Burger ($ 17+), aber auch ein Omelet East West ($ 14+). Wir bestellten die Burger medium rare und erfuhren, dass dies hier pink genant wird. Die aus S\u00fc\u00dfkartoffeln hergestellten Pommes gibt es zum Burger dazu und schmecken vorz\u00fcglich. Soft Drinks hei\u00dfen in den Staaten Sodas (Cokes, Fantas etc.) kosten $ 4. Und den Pott Kaffee bekommt man f\u00fcr $ 4, freies Nachschenken inklusive.\nZu Spitzenzeiten ist das Restaurant sehr gut besucht und man muss Wartezeiten bis zu 45 Minuten hinnehmen. Die Bedienung wie immer freundlich, aber bei vollem Lokal \u00fcberfordert. H\u00e4ufiges Warten ist leider angesagt, auf die Bestellannahme, auf die Lieferung des Bestellten und auch auf die Rechnung, die doch sonst in den Staaten immer so schnell auf den Tisch gelegt wird. \nFazit: Zentral gelegene, preislich vern\u00fcnftige Futterstelle.

review_32871,others,Disclaimers and qualifiers first.  Every child is different and every family is different in their educational needs and priorities and every child learns differently.  One school may be the perfect place for one child and not ideal for another. So our experience has been pretty widespread.\n\nLets start with safety.  You can always find state inspections on the state website for licensed child-care facilities.  These inspections will tell you a lot of useless things but will also provide light on some useful things such as if there is a valid fire safety plan and are all of the teacher background checked and fingerprinted.  Keep in mind that every facility will have a few citations.  This is how the state makes money.  The other safety feature I liked about this school is that there is only one entrance/exit door and that is through the front.  So the likelihood of a run-away child is nearly impossible.,2

review_369745,restaurant,We split the Western omelette. I really really wanted to like this place but sadly I just can't make it something that it wasn't. The omelette had about 5-6 small cubes of sausage and bits of mushrooms but mostly egg and green onion. The home fries were basically flat wafers of potatoes and were kind of rubbery. We ordered a side of home fries for 2.50 and honestly the side and what came with the food still didn't quite make up a great serving. People rave about the amount of food but I am but sure why. The omelette was supposed to be 4 eggs but there is NO WAY that was the case. \n\nSo about that coffee. I could tell when I saw the waitress pour it and I could see through it like water that it was a problem. Very disappointing. Fortunately I was so cold that it just was nice to have a hot  beverage. Service was very accommodating and friendly.\n\nSorry Mama but this time you struck out.,1
review_385870,restaurant,"I've never written a review before but I had to here. Although the entrees were good, the fried pickles were sooo salty!! It was like eating a salt lick. I wouldn't have been upset but after mentioning it to the waiter, who was nice but not very attentive, said he would let the kitchen know but never refunded me!! We didn't even eat them so it was obvious!!! Not to mention, they charge you for sides, the price on the sandwiches are expensive, then add an additional charge for a side. They ask you what side you want without mentioning it will be extra, you would assume the sandwiches would come with a side since the prices are high. I also waited 15 minutes to ask for ketchup so I got some myself from another table. I feel the owners are greedy. Not coming back",1

review_504126,entertainment,"So not impressed with this place on a Friday night.\n\nWe were able to get on the guest list a little too easily...this should have been our first sign.  We got there and had no wait in line...another sign.  We get in and there was hardly anyone in there.  The decor is just blah...  From the lighting, the place appeared black on black on black with a splash of yellow light.  Just weird.  The music was also strangely un Vegas like.\n\nThe positives:  We were able to easily and quickly get to the bar for drinks, the go-go dancers were pretty, and we could quickly and easily exit when we finished our 1 and only drink.\n\nSeriously doubt we will be returning to Chateau anytime in the near future.",1

The room smells like cat pee and they don't bother to clean it up and just let the disgusting, unsanitary conditions persist. If you complain they shrug their shoulders at you.

review_276326,drinks,"Spending a lot of my childhood in Canada led to a quick obsession with boba tea.\n\nHowever, in Arizona, a really good boba place is hard to come by but then I found Eba a few years ago. Their drinks are so refreshing and as good as you can possibly find in this area. Plus, the boba come out just right, not too hard or chewy, which seems to be a huge problem for some places. I recommend the almond milk tea with boba, which is my personal favorite.\n\nI almost cried when I thought they went out of business after they closed their old location but they ended up relocating so go to this one and try it out!",4

review_27757,entertainment,"I've recently been trying to find a cool place to play shuffleboard in North Phoenix.  I was trying to find a place to hang out near my bro's house so we could go hang out for a bit and have a beer.  I found Brennan's online and noted that they had shuffleboard.  WIN WIN!!  The review said that the staff was friendly and called you \""honey\"" even if it was the first time you had ever been there.  BANG!  sounds like my kinda joint, so  i called my bro and said, \""hey man, let's go to this joint by your house and play some shuffleboard and have a beer\"".  So, off we went.  I got there and when I approached the bar, the bartender looked at me like I was from Mars. I said hello, FIRST. She says Hi.  Then I said \""How's it going?\""  I felt like I was demonstrating to her how to greet a customer. So I ordered drinks, asked for shuffleboard disks and some menus. I was told that I could grab my own menu and that if I wanted something, I needed to come back and order.  Cool,  no biggie,  but no points for hospitality there.  No real attempt at gaining some sort of an EARNED tip, no prob, it's only my first impression of the place.  SO,  we play some shuffle board.  5 red disks, 3 blue, that's all they have and the shuffleboard table was not in proper working order and it wasn't like the guy sitting on his butt in the office right there was gonna check on us to see if everthing was okay.  So, it don't matter, we's having some beers and it's all good.  We get hungry and decide to look at the menus.  The menus said that THURSDAY was Indian Fry Bread day. Apparently, I am told that they haven't done that IN A LONG TIME.  I guess they didn't get around to changing the menu, but hey it's only my first impression of the joint.  Glad the regulars love it, they can have it.  Oh and I agree with a former poster about the Irish draw of the place.  I thought it was gonna be an Irish place,  not even close.  Crappy hospitality, limited beer menu etc......",1

review_412608,others,"If I could rate negative stars i would.  My advice is do not stay at this hotel if they are even close to being full.

The following day when I spoke to the assistant manager she said to me \""I hope that employee doesn't act that way around other people and I am only knowing about this because you are telling me\"".

review_163890,others,"This review is solely for a member of the casino staff, not the hotel accommodations or anything else. My friends and I were walking around the casino at around 5 in the morning looking for food after a very hectic night. We were a group of 3 Asian American guys, 1 Indian American guy, and me (Asian American girl). We approached a manager (his name was Jeff), to ask (in perfect American accents) if there were any food places around that were open at that time. He seemed willing to help, and looked over our group for a few seconds, then told us that he wasn't sure what kind of Asian food was around, but that there might be some \""Vietnamese or Thai places off the strip\"" if we wanted to go that far. My friends and I were so surprised by this blatantly racist statement, and gently told him that we were looking for any kind of food, not just Asian food. He seemed a bit flustered, as if he realized that what he said was a bit of a faux pas, and directed us towards a couple open restaurants within the Venetian. We thanked him and left, somewhat in a state of shock. \n\nAdmittedly, it was very early in the morning, and I understand that Jeff was most likely trying to be nice and giving us selections that he thought we would be familiar with. However, I would think that out of all the different people visiting Vegas every day, the staff should be a little more wary of statements that could be construed as offensive. I'm not saying this guy should be fired, since it was clear that he was trying to be helpful, but I hope he learns that when dealing with customers, it's very important to be aware of political and social correctness.",0
review_262597,restaurant,(singing) Outback steak house! Being that this is a chain restaurant and I have eating at many Outback's in my time. I can truly say that this particular one has the best service and great food. \n\nLike most outbacks they look the same and serve up the same food but I was wowed by how great the service was here.

review_117148,restaurant,"One of my favorite places!\n\nI have a confession though... I'm a trivia addict.  So any restaurant or bar that has the Buzztime trivia automatically gets an extra start in my book... but for some reason this is where I like to play more than anywhere else.  I usually hang out in the bar/off track betting area, playing trivia and once in a while betting on the horses or dogs (with miserable results, I hate to add.)\n\nOne of my favorite sandwiches in the Valley is here - I love their Buffalo Chicken.  It's huge and covered in a pretty hot yet flavorful buffalo sauce. Unlike most places where it's not hot enough... oh and they let me choose the heat level.  Wings are really great here as well.\n\nNow I'm wanting to get back over there for a beer, buffalo chicken and gave of trivia... Too bad it's only Thursday.  \n\nCons: If you are a young single man looking to go out and meet someone, avoid this place at all costs.

review_405329,restaurant,"As I walk down University Avenue along the ASU campus I see the usual suspects; coffee houses, bookstores, and oodles of fast food joints.  Today there is a new kid in town.  Smashburger.\n\nA fresh take on the classic fast food burger joint, Smashburger offers made-to-order burgers; Rosemary, olive oil, garlic fries (Smashfries); and Haagen-Dazs shakes.  Every Smashburger is made when it's ordered, so don't come here if you are late to class; the wait from order to delivery is about five to seven minutes, and you'll want to take your time enjoying these burgers.  Smashburger takes a different approach to burger preparation - they start with a one-third or half pound ball of 100% fresh Angus beef; smash, sear, and season it on a flat grill, then serve it on a buttered-toasted artisan bun and top it with cheese, fresh produce and condiments. The result is an irregularly shaped, juicy, delicious burger.\n\nI stopped down there today for the grand opening and tried the BBQ, Bacon, &amp; Cheese Smashburger ($5.99) with Smashfries ($1.79), and Veggie Frites ($2.99).  Right away I noticed that the Smashburger differentiates itself from other burgers with ambrosial seasonings and juiciness.  Yes, this burger was juicier than Perez Hilton gossip at a Hollywood red carpet event.  These guys really have the searing down to a science.  A few other points of interest - the Smashfries are delicious; the whole rosemary, garlic, oil coating really works well.  Points for the Veggie Frites, too.  You get a nice blend of asparagus, carrots, and green beans, which are flash fried and seasoned, then served hot to your table. They offer a few other menu items including a Smashchicken sandwiches, Smashdogs, and Smashsalads (if you're into that healthy stuff).\n\nIf Smashburger has a weakness, it's the hours of operation.  I mean, come on.. you are operating on a college campus and closing at 10 PM every night?  Seriously?  One thing ASU needs are more places to soak up all that alcohol after a long night on the sauce.  I'll give Smashburger a half point back for opening at 10 AM to help cure the hangover the next day.  I have a feeling that a smashed, seared burger and greasy coated fries may remedy the brown bottle flu.\n\nOverall, Smashburger is a hit and is sure to win the hearts and minds of hungry college students roaming the streets of Tempe, Arizona.",3
review_343638,restaurant,"So let me start off with a basic fact about me...I am NOT a buffet person!  I will NEVER, EVER  suggest we go to a buffet.  I only go when I am outnumbered or when family is visiting. So take this review as you may.  \n\nI went here for the first time this week since I had family staying at the Silverton.  I have eaten at many of the restaurants there and have always been happy, so I was aware of the food quality level and just went with it.  \n\nIt started off with us in a short line to pay and be seated.  Even though it was a really short line, it took over 25 minutes to get a table.  I'm not sure why, because there were a lot of open tables that I could see and they seemed to be adequately staffed, so I am not sure where the disconnect was.  So that just put me in a bad mood because I was pretty hungry.  Just a warning for y'all, when I get hungry, throw a cracker or something at me because I turn into that girl from the Exorcist when I am starving.  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.\n\nNext up, the food.  I was actually surprised how many sections they had available.  There was a soup and salad bar, pasta bar, pizza, American comfort food, Chinese, Mexican, roasted/grilled meats, and a dessert bar that included freshly made ice cream.  It wasn't a huge buffet, but i found plenty of items that looked and tasted pretty good.  No, it wasn't as big as the World Buffet at the Rio or fancy like the Wynn, but it was ok for what it was.  So yay for that surprise!\n\nThe service across the board was hit or miss.  Our table server was very nice and on her game.  She did great.  The hostesses were all a bit grumpy.  Some of the chefs behind the food counters were not happy to be there, but the chef at the meat craving station was just adorable.  The chef in the dessert section was happy.  So it was a little all over the place.\n\nSo Seasons is an average buffet for Vegas quality.  If you are a buffet person and in the area, it is an ok place.",2
review_93997,restaurant,"Definitely an interesting little place up in North Phoenix, La Oaxaquena hovers between a three and a four, but closer to four.

What the heck??  \n\nThe classic unassuming strip-mall Mexican place, the interior was much bigger than normal and the colors were interesting but I thought they added a nice touch.  The cashier / server girl was really friendly and service was SUPER fast.\n\nOn to the food - I went with the lunch special of a taco and tostada for $4.95 (what a steal!).  I was assuming when I requested chicken that both items would have chicken on them - something to keep in mind.  The taco was excellent!  A crunchy shell housed deliciously tender chicken, and fresh lettuce and tomato on top.  The tostada was OK, but I think that has way more to do with the fact that I'm not a huge refried beans fan.  Oh, and the chips and salsa were some of the best complimentary additions I've had.\n\nAs Daren C. mentioned, $5.35 total will get you some good food, and you'll leave stuffed and ready to pass out in the afternoon of your job.",3

Forget Deli 500, on Sherbrooke, it's not worth any trip. Katz is nice but it stops there, ordinary, nothing more. The slaw is served in tiny paper cups, too wet. Meat portions are, let's say, average to small. The mustard spread is almost none on average bread. I've seen much better. I make better ones at home ! Unfortunately, there is no difference between the choices of meat cookings offered on the menu, old fashioned, etc... Seasonnings should be better. I would like to compare with Katz New York and see if it's a general lazyness or just a local thing. Anyway, we (Montreal) have the best Bagel in America !!!",2

review_350581,shopping,"I actually stumbled across this place by accident.  For some reason, I've never really been a big fan of Mesa and I'm not exactly sure why.  I had even dated a dude who lived in Tempe and whenever we went out, I'd always choose Scottsdale/Phoenix/Chandler over Mesa.  Weird.\n\nAnyway, it just so happened that my aunt and uncle were down here visiting and for whatever reason, they needed to go to some place in Mesa - so my mother and I tagged along.\n\nWe were looking for a place to eat when we drove by the Mekong Plaza.  Curious, we pulled a U-ey and checked it out.  One end of the plaza was virtually deserted, but once you rounded the corner, we found the main entrance and some little restaurants.  We ended up deciding on Chinese food for the afternoon - oops!  I mean, \""Taiwanese\"" food.  I dunno how I could've gotten those two confused.  Heh.  Anyway, I'll review that place later...\n\nAfter lunch, we decided to look around while we were there...\n\nA lot of the retail space was vacant, but they did have miscellaneous lessees, such as: a barber, cell phone shop, various small restaurants, a gift shop, a nail supply store, a dentist, and of course, the supermarket.\n\nThe gift shop was small and quaint.  They had some cute little trinkets.  They were super expensive, though.  They had this Hello Kitty case that was identical to one that I bought from Target.  I paid about $4.00 for mine, but they were selling it for $17.00.  \n\nThey were also selling faux Coach bags.  I still don't fully understand how that appreciates Chinese culture - maybe there is pride in manufacturing pieces of *bleep* that look like the real thing from a distance, but are so poorly constructed that your hands actually feel dirty after touching them.  Not only that, but they were selling them for $70!  That's way too much for fake (unless we're talking about my blonde highlights)!\n\nI wasn't too keen on a dentist's office being in what is basically a strip mall.  \""Honey, I'm going to the Mekong for some Orange Chicken and oral surgery!\""\n\nNow, onto the market!\n\nWhen you first approach the market, it's kinda impressive.  They have some items on display outside of the store, so it's kinda like you're walking through an indoor street fair to get to the market.  \n\nThere are two very distinct things you notice when you first arrive and stand in the entrance:\n\n1)  The store carries so many products!  You could probably find just about any South East Asian food item you were looking for, plus some traditionally Western items like Heinz Ketchup and Campbell's Soup.  \n\n2)  The STENCH!\n\nFrom the entry, there was a foul odor of rotting flesh and fish hanging in the air.  Now, don't go stating the obvious \""Well, it IS an Asian market, moron!\""  I know that.  However, there is no excuse for that type of \""aroma\"" polluting the air.  The fish/butcher counters are not close enough to the front door to warrant such a concentrated pungency.  As a result, I'm left to question either the cleanliness of the market or the freshness of their meats, and if I have to do that, I will err on the side of caution, therefore, their meat/fish departments will not receive my business.\n\nOther than that, the store wasn't bad.  They had a nice produce section that had a reasonable variety of veggies and herbs.  The items that they placed on sale had kickass prices (i.e. Chinese eggplant $.69/lb., patis $.89/bottle, coconut milk $.69/can, etc.).  Aside from the items on sale, I think their prices are mediocre, if not on the higher side.\n\nAs I was checking out after buying a few cans of coconut milk, a bottle of patis, and some canned sardines, I asked the cashier how long they had been open, since I saw \""Grand Opening\"" signs hanging from the ceiling.  She didn't speak English, at least, not English I could understand, so the previous customer was kind enough to stay and translate for us.  Apparently, the store had been open for six months, which still makes it relatively new, I guess.  Too new, IMO, for that foulness to be permeating the air.\n\nIt was nice to visit the Mekong Market, but it's not any place I'd go out of my way for.  If you're closer to a Lee Lee or one of the other ethnic markets in the valley, they would suffice just as well.  If you feel the MM beckoning to you, though, make sure to take advantage of their bargain sale prices, and use your own good judgement when venturing to the land of meat and fish.\n\nWhile I think the store in and of itself rates 4-stars, I'm assessing three because there is no excuse for the poor air quality.  At the very least, they could invest in some better ventilation or fans (or gas masks)!",2
review_499085,restaurant,"Our last visit gave us great service and excellent cocktails, but not as good food as in the past.  We had the bacon wrapped dates that were stuffed with blue cheese - the bacon was very, very well done.  Our favorite flatbread with filet and caramelized onions had way more mushrooms than filet, way more cheese than in the past and was underseasoned.  Remembering how this dish was always such a flavor explosion, I felt weird shaking salt and pepper on it.  The caesar salad with the lemon anchovy dressing, all tied up with a proscuitto ribbon, was outstanding.  I could've eaten 4 of those.  We've enjoyed La Cave so much in the past, the other dishes overshadowed the salad, making this visit disappointing.  La Cave's not at the top of our list anymore.",2
review_567196,restaurant,"Their penne pasta is cooked just the way I like it. My best friend and I were trying to describe it the next morning and the only words to come out of our mouths (and at the same time) was \""AL DENTE!!!\""\n\nWe also got the bianca pizza which was really great. It's thin crust and you can taste each and every ingredient (prosciutto, arugula, etc). The spaghetti and meatballs wasn't my fave but my friends really liked the meatballs. \n\nMy friends and I went to Vegas twice in 3 months and came here both times after XS. Overpriced for what you get but it's Vegas. The close proximity makes up for it (although it doesn't feel so close by the end of the night when you're dying in your heels)!",3
review_144547,restaurant,"Haven't eaten here in awhile and remember it being delicious. This time I wasn't impressed.\n\nmy glass had orange juice crust on the outside and our hash browns looked and tasted old. My pancakes were great however ruining pancakes is a feat in itself. I wouldn't eat here again since I ended up paying $32.71 for three small plates and water.  For the money egg works or sunrise cafe are twice as good. Hope this was useful.\n\nAlso a small side not, there was a dog loose in their parking lot and I asked for a piece of bread or something to try and coax it to me and they were going to charge me for a side of sausages, I wasn't going to eat it! They lacked compassion and if you can't treat an animal right how can you treat a person right. No wonder the service was terrible.",0
review_247960,medical,"I hesitate to do this review because it can get busy in here, and let's face it, who wants to wait when you feel like crapola?\nThis urgent care I have made my \""primary care\"" because it is staffed with ER doctors and you don't get the typical \""physicians assistant\"" treatment. \nIn fact, when I first went on Labor Day of 2010, the doctor there sent me to the ER and correctly diagnosed me after a month of misdiagnosis by my now former Top Doctor! \nYesterday I went because I have a cold (no big deal) and an ear infection (big deal, I am a flight attendant and have to fly and that is a No-NO with an ear infection). There was a long wait (about an hour and a half) but once I got in to see the doctor, it was 15 minutes and I was out of there!\nVery clean, organized, and professional, and EVERYONE is very, very nice.\nHighly recommend this place, folks!

review_303705,restaurant,"I saw this place featured on Rachel Ray's vacation and could not wait to try it!  Carne Vino translates simply into meat and wine. \n\nFOOD\nOrder the 'La Fiorentina' (~$70/person). They carve the meat right beside your table and even have their own personalized steak knives with their name Carne Vino on it. Impressive. \n\nWe also added a 'Black Truffle Vinaigrette\"" ($5) sauce to go with the meat. It was good, but didn't add that much more flavor to the meat. SKIP.\n\nEach slice of juicy meat literally melts in your mouth and I really wanted another order. But seeing that my mom and I had already spent $140 on just the meat..we decided to just move onto dessert...\n\nWe chose the 'Peach and Blackberry Tart' ($12), which had a hazelnut crust. The presentation was wonderful, but the peach and blackberry didn't seem to go together that well. A little more tart that I expected. SKIP.\n\nTIP\nIt is located inside Palazzo in Las Vegas. Make a reservation.\n\nWould come back, but only for steak and nothing else.",3

Sadly there are a few stores left still lingering around but hey, I'm sure the rent is reasonable considering the land is falling apart.

Or maybe that makes me a Cookie Hooker,  a tried-and-true Cook-ker perhaps?  \n\nAnyhow, along comes Urban Cookies on an increasingly cool part of 7th St.  to make me consider settling down for this AZ goodie.  Well, I haven't quite settled down or anything -  I'm still shoppin around.  But, the \""Simple Urban\"" cookie which is their simple milk chocolate chip - is one noble effort.  Not quite the best cookies ever, but a valiant try.\n\nThe mix of ingredients and baking on this is really good.  Perhaps a little too soft from the June heat, but not bad.  Besides being 99% organic, it's soft, chewy, with just the right taste of vanilla and wheat.  \n\nThe owners are a married couple who bake early in the morning and spend the rest of the day packaging the treats for sale, either one-by-one or by the dozen.   They market themselves as the hip, funky alternative to Mrs. Fields - and they're about right on.\n\nThese cookies haven't quite made a religious convert out of me or made the Cookie Monster in me give up walking Van Buren - but still good nevertheless.",3

They are the perfect blend of tart and sweet with the smokey tequila taste in the background. Delicious!  The enchiladas are to die for and I also like the fajitas. The service is good, even on busy nights. This place got 5 stars because they really have the best authentic ingredients that I look for when craving Mexican food.

review_430241,restaurant,"Rude drive-thru staff. Was asked to repeat my order two more times after driving up to the window to pay.  Not sure who was working but she had blonde hair and kept staring at me -and not in a good way. Did not smile once.  I said thank you to her twice and not even a \""you're welcome\"" or \""thanks.\""  They weren't even busy.  Nope just asked if I needed any sauce or ketchup and when I said no thanks, shoved the food at me.\n\nI know it's a fast-food job and not the best pay in the world, but if you are going to work in the drive-thru or be expediting to the customer, you at least need to know how to be polite to the customers.\n\nAlso, I live about five minutes from this location and when I got home and sat down to eat the Whopper I ordered, it was barely even warm.  The lettuce was wilted and soggy.  The meat patty was dry and not juicy and hot like a fresh burger ought to be. I know it was not made fresh because how could the sandwich be barely luke-warm but the fries were hot?  Most likely will not return to this location, unless they make some much needed improvements.\n\nI suggest that if you do visit this location and have a bad experience, to take the survey and tell them about this place.  Not only did I take their survey, but I also copied the link from Yelp for this location and noted in the comments that quite a few other people have had negative experiences here.  Suggested that maybe a change in the employment and or management may be needed.  They should send someone through from Corporate randomly a few times to see what us customers are talking about.",0

U would think they would put my order aside, but noooo!!!  I had to wait another HOUR. I WANTED IT SO BADLY I JUST LEFT AND RETURNED.

NIGHTMARE! and no compensation for the huge inconvenience. \n\n2nd bad visit...they were out of brisket. Just out?  No brisket?  A huge part of the everyday menu?

review_153545,entertainment,"I've stayed at the Strat at least once a year for the last five years.  This has always been an out of the way hike from the main strip, but it used to be a cheap and fun place to stay.  Sadly I've seen a steady decline at this place.  The closing of the Sahara down the street seems to have hit this place hard.  Five years ago this was a cheap place to stay with a lot of entertainment right in the building.  Now it's only good for a cheap place to stay if you plan to spend your days elsewhere, especially if you have already seen the view from the tower.  The current owners bought this place about five years ago at the height of the real estate bubble.  Since that time they've lost money almost every month and have engaged in some serious cost cutting to try and ride out the recession.  In the last five years they've closed Polyester's nightclub, Lucky's Diner, the celebrity impersonator show, the topless pool on the roof, their steakhouse restaurant and bar,  and most of the live bands that play in the casino.  The impersonator show used to be fun for kids and adults alike.  Now they've got very little in the way of entertainment or dining going on.  \n\nThe slot machines used to be among the loosest in Vegas, on my most recent visit I noticed the average payout for a bonus round was about $20.  Yawn.  OK, this is the same story at most of the casinos since the recession hit, but they used to have decent rules blackjack tables with $5 minimums.  On my most recent visit last weekend I was appalled to learn that they now pay 6:5 blackjack on most of their  tables.  They still have a few 3:2 tables, but they have $10 minimums, so of course all the clueless morons flock to the $5 minimum tables with the 6:5 payout.  If you want the 3:2 payout, you'll probably be sitting alone at a table, which I don't like.\n\nOn a recent visit I stayed at the Plaza downtown.  Brand new rooms for less that the Stratosphere, the Freemont Street experience and all the entertainment there nightly right outside the front door, and the Golden Nugget right down the street with some of the best blackjack rules in Vegas.  Looks like I'll be spending most of my visits downtown from now on.  So long, Stratosphere.",1

review_458183,entertainment,"Let me just start by saying that admission to this place costs more than the Phoenix Zoo... and it's in a mall!  Once I was able to get past that, and realized that my still under 3 year-old daughter got free admission, I really had a good time.  I had no expectations going in, but the exhibits they had were really impressive.  All I had to do was look at the expression on my daughter's face as she ran from aquarium to aquarium yelling \""Daddy, do you see that?!\"" to know that it was worth the trip. The best part of the exhibit was the large tank at the end with a viewing tunnel going through it.  This gives you almost 360 degree views of everything from sharks to rays to jellyfish.  \nWord to the wise, though, if you're planning on making a trip to this place, maybe call ahead and see if their are any field trips planned for the day.  We showed up at about the same time as 10 school buses did, and spent most of the day dodging 200 running, screaming elementary school kids.\nHaving lived in AZ for nearly 5 years now, and not getting to see a whole lot of sea life in that time, Sea Life AZ was a pretty neat experience and a place that I will definitely take my daughter to again... but only until she turns 3",2
review_361927,others,"A solid 3.5 stars actually.  Where else can you go to slap the high quality lifelike silicon impression of a porn star ass?  And of course it would be Vegas that has a porn museum!  This place is too brightly lit to be sexy or fully enjoyed as a couple (if you know what I mean), but it does have an interesting assortment of porn from across the globe, across times, and across taste.  It has a strong message of tolerance running through it, like so long as two consenting adults want to do xxxx, who are we to judge it.  For instance, there is a minor shrine and exhibit to Larry Flynt.  It presents a broad array of porn artifacts including life size casts of many real porn star body parts some of which you are free to slap, grab, and squeeze to your heart's content.  Everything is presented quite clinically, so much so that things I thought were pretty gross to look at going in were just another interesting graphic surprise by the time I had left.  It is surprising how quickly one can desensitize oneself when moral reaction is void.  The assortment of video available to view there is pretty broad.\n\nAnyway, if you would like your mind to remain closed, by all means do not come here.  But if you up for an interesting hour or two, check it out and see how the freaky other halves live :-p\n\nA suggestion for the erotic heritage museum.  Throw a couple cardboard cutouts of porn stars, perhaps in some provocative poses, out front (but inside the pay area in the first lobby part) that folks can take pictures with, perhaps suggestive of various sexual acrobatics.

I really like this place ,what you would pay for a movie and dinner you can do here all in one. food is priced good. the dessert and alcohol was a little crazy. we order a Molten Chocolate Cake w/Vanilla ice cream it was 7$ was so not worth it it came on a reg sized plate and a lil cup for the ice cream the cake itself was no bigger than the palm of my hand(i have tiny lady hands lol). i still would come here again but learned my lesson on the desserts.Its a fun date night. i also would like to add that yes they do not clear off you dishes so if no one is seating next to you(which we got lucky) then you can just put you stuff on the next seat but if not than those dishes might be with you the whole movie.",3
review_604561,restaurant,"The service was slow. \nThe beer selection was pretty good if pricey.\nThe burgers were good.  They allowed custom orders too.\nThe BBQ fries did not work for any of us and we were starving.  I  love fries, almost any fries, but these were not good.  If I were forced to eat here again I'd try the fat fries or get the BBQ fries without the BBQ salt. Hated it. B",2

review_156274,restaurant,"Whoahhhh!!! Now this is what i call a throw down!\n\nOf course, i'm referencing Bobby Flay's inventive cuisine at his southwestern themed restaurant in Caesar's palace, Las Vegas.   \n\nIt was our first night and after winning a grip of change form the slots at Caesar's, my friend suggested eating at Mesa Grill for din din.  I wasn't too familiar with the restaurant but when I realized it was Bobby Flay's joint, my interest was certainly piqued.  \n\nTruth be told, i'm not a Flay fanatic by an stretch, but a little star power never hurt anyone IMO.  With that said, there's always the pressing issue of hype over substance which in turn had me proceeding with cautious optimism.  \n\nAs we made our way across the bustling casino and stepped into the restaurant, I definitely felt the warmth of the contemporary Latin theme throughout the communal dining space, which was flanked with rich reds and soft golden hues. \n\nWithin moments, the hostess greeted us and proceeded to lead us to our seats.  Our server wasted no time in taking our orders, as well.\n\nIn record time, we got our beautifully plated appetizers and entrees. \nLet's just say my doubts melted away with my very first bite! Wow, this food had big, bold flavor and the quality was incredible! \n\nHere's a rundown of what we had:\n\nShrimp tamale - Plump, juicy and mouthwatering gulf shrimp in a fresh corn meal that was both rich & flavorful. Outstanding! \n\nTuna nachos - Fresh chunks of seasoned ruby red tuna in a sweet & tangy sauce that had a pleasant citrusy finish. The crisp corn tortilla added a nice contrast in texture to this refreshingly vibrant dish! Lip smacking goodness in every bite!\n\nPork tenderloin - This dish was absolutely phenomenal!!! The meat was like a perfectly cooked filet! It was soft, buttery and rich. Perfectly decadent and oh so flavorful! Honestly, the meat was so tender, i kept asking my friends \""Are you sure this is pork?\"" \n\nSpice Filet - Buttery, tender and succulent beef filet with a pleasant kick from the house spices! Scrumptious!\n\nLamb chops - Beautiful crust and perfectly pink inside. Boasting a magnificent charbroiled flavor that was absolutely addicting! Seconds please!\n\nCorn - Fresh cuts of corm kernels with explosive flavor and fantastic texture. This is a side you don't wanna miss!\n\nAfter consuming all that delicious food, we simply had no additional room for dessert. Besides, wehad our minds set on some chocolate decadence at Max Brenner's afterwards (review forthcoming)\n\nOverall, service was attentive, friendly and fast. The food, of course, was incredible and most importantly, it didn't break the bank either!\n\nWhy? Because this birthday boy didn't have to pay...lol\n\nHappy Eats!",3
review_491989,restaurant,"Probably one of the best brunch buffets in town.  I loved the individual servings.  I have no idea why anyone would complain about having individual serving dishes vs. having to serve yourself out of a huge tray of food. I thought the mini metal pans and baskets were great.  It really is a great concept.  Some of the dishes really stood out (mac and cheese, eggs benedict).  Our server was very attentive and kept our mimosa glasses full.  Love the nice bottle of water on the table.  Could possibly use some more variety but we were absolutely stuffed when we left.",3
review_585507,others,"Don't know what the rave is about this place. Tried them once and didn't really have a good experience. A few months later I thought I'd give it another chance. Bought the green tea, fat Elvis and nutty pig. First off, I really don't like the dough at pink box. It's very dense and dry, something I could get at Albertsons...not fluffy at all. The green tea was okay, the frosting at the top was hard though. The fat Elvis was nothing mind blowing, honestly the best part was the glazed banana as the topping. The nutty pig was recommend by the cashier as delicious, and keep in mind that I like bleu cheese. The vinaigrette glaze was just disgusting. Save your money, this place is pretty pricey too. Will not be returning any time soon.",0

Portobello has a fair few of these, and this one is just like any other.  It has the normal range of alcohol, snacks, sweets, and magazines.  There was also a good range of tinned goods and other non-perishable food items.  The floor space went back surprisingly far, and the stock was definitely crammed in.\n\nNot much more that can be said really: this is another handy local newsagents.",2
review_269642,restaurant,"I love food but can't always afford to dine out at $$$ places so when Travelzoo had a deal for ENVY Steakhouse in Las Vegas I bought one: $79 for $140 worth of food. I made reservations on opentable.com and got 1000 points for it which I can cash in towards a dining certificate which meant I saved more money. ENVY is located in the Renaissance Hotel which is right next to the Las Vegas Convention Centre. \nThe Renaissance a non-smoking, non-gaming hotel which is amazing considering you can find slot machines literally everywhere from Laundromats to your local grocery store. There is valet parking for free and you may enter the restaurant either via the hotel lobby or by the separate street entrance located around the corner to your right from the main entrance of the hotel.\n\nTo me Envy has the look and feel of a classic steakhouse with muted lighting and solid furniture. The seats are upholstered and well padded and seating consists of tables or booths. The menu reflects the same: Steak and Seafood and what I always find on menus of steakhouses: Caesar Salad, French Onion Soup and some entrees for those who want something other than steak. We started with Espresso Skirt Steak and the Peppered Calamari & Rock Shrimp. The Espresso Skirt Steak was nice. The beef was melt in your mouth tender. The hint of espresso was a little too subtle, it tasted more of the wine used in the deglazing; I could barely tell that espresso was there. The Calamari & Rock Shrimp were cooked well, tender but the sauces were a great disappointment. They tasted like they came out of a jar; one tasted like concentrated ketchup with some salt and pepper added and the other was obviously a sweet chili Thai sauce that was also out of a bottle. The portions were extremely generous. I made the mistake of not having steak at a steakhouse. I had the Grand Seafood Plateau and my companion had the Balsamic Lamb Rack.\n\nThe Seafood Plateau looked magnificent and everything was fresh and well prepared but really it was just fresh seafood boiled and chilled. There were oysters, crab legs, lobster, shrimp, clams, and mussels. The clam and mussels were a little over done. The shrimp was huge jumbo shrimp and the best part of the plateau. The sauces again were terrible, the spicy cocktail sauce was the same sauce that came with the Calamari and Rock Shrimp, a mayonnaise, and there was another apple cider vinegar type sauce that really didn't add anything to the seafood so I opted to just use pepper and lemon juice. Regular price is $55, so I was glad I was using a discounted voucher. The lamb was cooked to perfection but lacked flavour. The sides were underwhelming. We had Grilled Asparagus with Dijon Glaze and Garlic Mashed Potatoes and Brussels sprouts. The portions again were huge and we could have done with just one side dish as both entrees had vegetables with them. The best was the garlic mashed potatoes. The asparagus and the glaze didn't go together and the Brussels sprouts were pretty basic.\n\nFor dessert we shared the Cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e. Presentation was nice with some berries on the side. It was good but again not the best Cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e I've had. It was ok. Our server was pleasant and helpful and even kept a running tab so that we knew how much we had left of the $140 at the end of our meal if we wanted to use it up. Overall it was a disappointing experience for the type of restaurant it was. The food was underwhelming and perhaps business has reflected that and the reason for the travelzoo voucher promotion. I'm glad I didn't pay full price for the meal. It is not a place I would return to given the myriad of restaurants in Las Vegas.",1

review_159856,others,"The fianc\u00e9e and I decided to stay at the Palms for two nights after receiving an offer for a couple of comped nights, a comped cabana at the Palms Pool, and a bottle of liquor for our stay.  The Palms had recently undergone a major remodel, so that added to my interest to see how much had changed since I'd last stayed there back in 2005 when it was one of the hottest, or at least buzziest, properties in Vegas before Wynn, Encore, the Palazzo, Cosmopolitan and CityCenter grabbed much of the spotlight.  Sadly, the last few years haven't been kind with Rain and the Playboy Club closing, Ghostbar growing long in the tooth and needing a refresh, and a moribund lineup of restaurants beyond N9NE and Aliz\u00e9. I'd previously enjoyed decent luck at its blackjack tables.  So, it was a no-brainer to stay and play especially given the incentives being offered.\n\nThe Palms is a comparatively small property and still a veritable chameleon, catering to locals by day and appealing to a younger, club-going crowd after the sun goes down.  Since our stay was mid-week, the atmosphere was pretty laidback.  Check-in was quick and painless.  The type of room that we'd requested (1 king bed) wasn't ready, but the personable front desk rep was able to put us in one of the remodeled rooms with 2 queens immediately, giving us one with a nice view of the Strip.  Our room was modern-looking and clean.  I wasn't all that enamored with the design aesthetic of the remodeled rooms, but we spent so little time in the room it could've been painted all black with velvet Elvis paintings hanging on the wall and it wouldn't have mattered to me so long as the bed was comfortable.  The Palms still has some of the most comfortable beds I've slept on in Vegas, better than the newer Cosmopolitan.  Housekeeping was timely and unobtrusive.  Its casino had plenty of tables with a variety of minimums, even having $5 craps and blackjack tables during the day.  Similarly, there was a wide array of slots and video poker machines of all denominations available to be played.  Cocktail service for players was frequent and fast.  Not to be left unmentioned, if you wanted to go to the Strip, the Palms also offered a free shuttle to/from the property to the Forum Shops.  Overall, friendly customer service was the norm property-wide from the front desk to dealers to cocktail waitress and bartenders. \n\nLas Vegas can be cruel with its \""what have you done for me lately?\"" mindset.  The Palms deserves a better fate than perhaps what has befallen it.  That said, I was very pleased with our stay.  (Reviews for specific locations within the Palms will be done separately.)  We enjoyed a comfortable, hospitable stay, experiencing plenty of good things that will certainly bring us back.",3
review_114109,restaurant,I wanted to wait to review Casey's until I actually sat down and ate a meal there.  I go to Casey's pretty often on the weekend nights to enjoy some libations but I had not actually ate any of the food.  \n\nI went today to have lunch with a friend and really enjoyed my Shrimp and Avocado salad.  The service was slow even though there was only one other occupied table in the restaurant area.  The food definitely made up for the slower service.  They have a lot of seafood on the menu as they are an Oyster house. I don't know that I would ever try oysters in the middle of the desert but I hear their Clam Chowder is awesome.   A lot of friends eat here on a regular basis and enjoy it but I mostly go to Caseys for liquid refreshment only. \n\nThe only complaint I have is that this place gets PACKED some weekends and the wait for the bathroom can be ridiculous.  I really don't like overcrowded places and Caseys definitely has that potential on any given Friday or Saturday night.,3
review_204070,drinks,"We had dinner reservations the night we came to the Petrossian Bar, so we were looking for a quick bite and a cocktail.  We had a lovely snack, the Chef's choice cheese plate and Beef Carpaccio.  The Beef Carpaccio was wonderful, but not a big portion, I would have like a little more.  The cheese plate was the perfect size.  We tend to sit at Bars, they are often much friendlier than tables, and we had a great time chatting with the Bartender, who hooked me up with tastes of several different Bourbons.  It's a little expensive, but really, we're at the Bellagio and expensive sort of comes with the territory.",3
review_634168,beauty,"On Sunday my husband and I were going to have professional photos taken and I decided at the last minute that I'd like to get my hair done. I looked online at a couple of blowout bars and was able to get an appointment within three hours at Sam Villa's. Honestly I was not TOO enthused that it was at Town Square (as a local I avoid that mall like the plague) but figured oh well. \n\nThe location is actually pretty great, it is on the outskirts of the mall, in an area without a lot of traffic by the Brazilian restaurant. Parking was a breeze, I was able to park right in front and not worry about sweating and ruining my hair. \n\nI was greeted at the entrance and my stylist Gabriella brought me in immediately. I told her what the occasion was and described the look I wanted, soft, bouncy curls. Well, she got to work on my hair. I am usually not very impressed with hair stylists in this town and can tell from the way they dry your hair if they are up to my standards. Usually when blow drying my thick, coarse and curly hair, the person does not use enough strength to do it and leaves it frizzy-ish. Not Gabriella, girl is strong but gentle. Anyway, after the blow drying she got to work on my hair and actually gave me tips to replicate it at home. Yeah right. My hair ended up looking fabulous, even better than I had hoped, really. Despite using more product than I would at home, it did not feel weighed down or greasy at all. Score!\n\nWhile they do your hair you can be entertained by the fashion show runaways playing on the screen as well as these crazy hair demos by (presumably) Sam Villa. \n\nAll in all a great experience. Although I kind of thought it was expensive at first, I can totally justify going there at least every couple of months for a special occasion.",4

review_398933,restaurant,"I wish Fugu was more than it is.  It's not horrible, but it's not particularly good either.  I was there with a friend and I ordered pork and beancurd in a garlic sauce, which I know the name of in Chinese, but the translation they had on the menu is probably not the best.  \n\nThe sauce wasn't particularly good.  It was spicy like it should be but too thick and gelatinous.  My dish was smothered in it and I couldn't really taste anything but the garlic sauce.  I think this is the same garlic sauce that they use in several of their dishes.  The pork and beancurd was more like a vehicle for mediocre sauce.  \n\nGrowing up in LA though, I may be spoiled by my idea of good Chinese food and this doesn't even begin to compare with the myriad of options in LA.

review_169787,others,"*Ahem*\n\nSo the photos of the rooms are not the actual rooms. Not even the newly remodeled ones.\n\nBut let us start at the beginning...\n\nWe stood in the check-in line for no less than 40 minutes at 10 p.m. on a Friday. This gave me plenty of time to inspect that unwashed masses that frequent the down-stairs area at night. It was like seeing the lights come on in a strip club at four in the morning. \n\nFine, whatever, it's Las Vegas and it's not exactly the Wynn, either. \n\nWe get up to our room, where the air-conditioning unit sounds like it's got emphysema. The paint int he bathroom was chipped. There was no floor-mat in the bathroom, either. No fridge, no coffee maker. Just a creepy pink-fur rug on the beds, like someone pelted a pimp.\n\nNo one got much sleep because of the AC, so the next morning my dad called the front desk and asked that someone come fix it. At two he called again and found out that the person he spoke to in the morning neglected to actually put in a service request. At 9 p.m. we called again. A technician finally came up and inspected the AC unit (claiming all the while that he'd been up to our room earlier). This time he figured out what was actually wrong. By 11 p.m. the AC was quiet again.\n\nDid anyone offer to put us in another room? No. Offer comped amenities? Nope. *Apologize* for the inconvenience? As if. \n\nThe signal in the hotel is pretty awful, too. \n\nAll-in-all, if I was FORCED to spend another night in LV, I would pick the Hilton off the strip. NEVER AGAIN, FLAMINGO!!",0

review_366238,restaurant,"Vegas expensive, weird decor, too many hostesses up front, great Chateaubriand, peppers!\n\nWalking up to the entrance you will likely see three or more girls at the hostess station, it won't be clear what they're all doing, but one will likely acknowledge and call yet another girl over to seat you. Try and ignore the huge Fernando Botero statue in the middle of the dining room. It's difficult, but you'll enjoy your meal more if you're not distracted. This is made easier because the dining room is \""upscale dark\"". However, the views of the pool outside are nice, it looks like the patio might be really nice as well. \n\nI have only had the Chateaubriand here along with various sides. It's fantastic. The whipped potaoes, asparagus, and other sides are good. The brussels sprouts (if they have them)  are pretty much worth it all by themselves. One interesting thing about the food is that the \""pepper steak\"" preparation listed on the menu isn't a black pepper rub. They cut jalapeno peppers with the steak and leave serve them on the plate.\n\nAt the end of the night, the bill will be high (not higher than other Vegas Strip steakhouses) but the food is excellent.",3

I love how they try to figure out what you like and then make suggestions for you. I love how even if you loose or scratch a dvd, they never blame you for it or charge you, they just go right ahead and send you a new one. However, I do not love the fact that their online options are lagging behind their competitors. I could overlook this when the instant queue was just included for free with the regular mail package but now that they are charging more for that, they really need to step up their game if they are going to keep their customers. \n\nI just really wish that they would get more options in their instant queue. I think someday in the future we will all be able to watch any movie or tv show ever made, instantly, at the touch of a button. But they are just not there yet. For, now I would settle for being able to watch a few new-ish releases and some old HBO shows. Really, I understand that there are licensing agreements but I just think that everything that they offer via mail should be available to watch online... then they could get away with offering it as a separate service and billing people for it. \n\nHere's an article from the Huffington Post that I thought was really interesting. http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/09/02/netflix-hbo_n_946598.html",2

It is okay to remove yourself if possible, but don't make it obvious right in front of us that you have a problem, she might as well have just came up and snatched the cigarette right out of his mouth.

Awesome Casino and dealers but that's another deal than the restaurant. \n\nI love a great steak and even with the mishap was prepared to give five stars until I had a steak dinner at believe it or not the Excalibur Steakhouse which kind of put the Hard rock to shame. Still it was five stars so only one taken away. \n\nAdvice...... Go to the Hard Rock Casino to be mesmerized by the dealers and people. Go to the Excalibur for a superior steak.",3

review_489840,restaurant,"This is a pretty good burger place, but it's far from the best.\n\nTheir interesting combinations makes this place better, not the meat. I really enjoyed my Kobe burger with bacon what not, aka the Gold Standard. The bun was nice. But the meat was slightly above average. Not great, but pretty good.\n\nThe onion rings were decent too. Nothing special, but good.",2
review_205958,others,"WAY overpriced and overrated.  4 stars, are you kidding?\n\nSince the rolls were so expensive, we thought that we'd get the most bang for our buck by ordering the pre-fixe menu which is about $49/person.  It comes with edamame, a salad of your choice, sashimi appetizer, entree of your choice, and dessert of your choice...\n\nLet's start with the good...\n\nService was great.  We didn't have to wait long for our food at all.\n \nPatio - the view of the strip was awesome.\n\nNow the bad...\n\nThe sashimi appetizer was 3 thinly sliced pieces of fish.  This hardly constitutes as an appetizer.  Unsatisfying.\n\nSalad - The kelp salad was yummy...the chicken salad was just your run of the mill greens plus grilled chicken.  I could have made it at home.\n\nEntree - Steak was tender & the fish of the day (halibut) was good...but it was just meat.  Maybe 2 or 3 vegetables.  Couldn't the entree at least come with a bowl of rice?  The cost would be maybe 50 cents?\n\nDessert - The mochi was SMALL (make a circle with one hand and that's how big it was), but the lychee flavor was good.  My husband ordered the sorbet, and unfortunately the chef's choice of the day was cucumber sorbet.  Have you ever had Korean pickled cucumber?  It tasted like that in sorbet form.  Not good.\n\nWe won't be coming back.",1
review_587789,entertainment,"Dear LA Fitness,\n\nI come to this location (driving past another for an extra ~3 miles) for the brand new equipment, relatively large space in the free weight area, stadium spin room, rows of cardio equipment and to see my awesome trainer Mike. \n\nI would consider myself a regular in that I'm here at least four times a week. \n\nBut what I don't do is come here on Sundays. Ever.\n\nSo when I signed up for an Abs Clinic smack dab in the middle of a Sunday I really thought it about. I imagine the other (roughly) twenty people that signed up did as well. It was at 1pm after all. Kind of putting a crimp into breakfast, brunch and/or lunch plans. On Father's Day.\n\nBut, hey, abs are important and I wanted to learn something new.  I was a bit bummed to learn the clinic was cancelled at 1:15pm. Again, On Father's Day. For future clinics it might help to also collect cell numbers (or emails) to contact members. This way folks can adjust their calendars. I hope the trainer feels better soon.\n\nThanks,\nIrene\n\nAnyone checking out this gym should probably read my earlier review. This really is a great place to workout. Just not on Father's Day.\n\nPersonal training is incredibly effective. Ask for Mike. (See my current results here http://tinyurl.com/llb3caz) With him I have a clearly laid out plan (not just a good workout on the days I see him). I know exactly what to do, the pace an exercise should be and what good form is. I feel comfortable walking around the \""man section\"" of the gym now. (Free weights.) Fair warning: You may not be able to walk or use your arms after a workout with him.",3

review_608973,restaurant,this place was staffed like they had never been open on a Friday night before.  pro tip: it's not a great customer perception when I can clearly see 2-3 servers just standing around and chatting at all times.  at least sneak out back and smoke like any self respecting wage slave.  the food was really bland which was weird because they bill themselves as a New Mexico style restaurant complete with south of the border spicy food.  my wife wants me to quote her here: I hate everything about this place.  sums up the experience pretty well.,1
review_121268,restaurant,I brought my boyfriend here last night for his birthday. I was really disappointed as several friends and family members have raved about the place. \n\nWe started with the bread basket which was quite dry. Next came the salad which was ok but nothing amazing. I did enjoy the gentleman who made it  \n\nFor our main course my boyfriend had the stuffed shrimp which was also very dry. We ordered a side of sauce but that didn't help much. I ordered the filet and shrimp au poivre which the best thing we had. It was good but I wouldn't say $58 good.  \n\nThe complimentary chocolate dipped fruit is the reason I'm giving them a 3. That was pretty amazing and the manager took my boyfriends shrimp off the bill. \n\nDon't really think I will ever make it back here.,2
review_286073,restaurant,"It was a beautiful night and a good start to our anniversary.  We decided to celebrate by dining at Aureole, or the restaurant with the huge tower of wine.\nWe ate in the court in which you can see the swans swimming in the pond.  It's about $95 per person for a four course meal.  \nDinner:  food was ok.  I love food for starters, let me say this.  I love different flavors and such.  However, I wasn't too blown away by what was presented.  Don't get me wrong, the presentation was beautiful.  However, the food was so so.  The highlight was the beef tartare.  I thought that to be very delicious.  I did not care for either veal dish presented.  That was my least favorite.  \nThe dessert was a duo of white chocolate and dark chocolate with mango sorbet.   The white chocolate dessert was delicious however i feel the mango should have been left completely off of the dark chocolate dessert.  I love the bitterness of dark chocolate and felt as though the mango did not pair well at all with this dish.\nService:  I believe service could have been a bit more personable.  Our drinks were constantly refilled, but we barely saw our waiter except when being served our meal.  To his credit he explained each dish and what we were seeing--but I expected that.  What I was looking for we him to ask if everything was ok and if there was anything that could be changed--he only asked during the next to the last course. \nCocktails:  they definitely utilize premium liquor for these cocktails.\nAll in all, it was a lovely dinner that definitely could have been better.  Our anniversary night wasn't ruined however, I did have high expectations for the food and service, especially for the price they charge.  Probably will not come back but at least it was an experience I can say I had.",2
review_490958,restaurant,Not bad. We came on a Sat. And it was packed a line out the door. So we opted for the take out. The burgers were good but the fries sucked.

It's happy hour M-F 2-4pm for all drinks and shakes.,1
review_141770,restaurant,"I have been a longtime fan of Roy's for almost ten years! If my travels come across a Roy's I am sure to dine in and enjoy the food and ambiance this restaurant provides. I have spent just about every occasion at Roy's; birthdays, anniversaries, New Year's, I even brought my entire wedding party to Roy's in Hawaii when I got married. Needless to say the service and food have been consistently good while the prices are very fare. \nMy latest journey into Roy's was off of Flamingo in Las Vegas; the manager this night that personally greeted our table was Chris Korom our server, Michelle. My husband and I ordered appetizers and the short ribs (one of our favorites)! While we did feel one of our appetizers was a little off this time the rest of our meal was amazing! We like to give feedback so we kindly asked Michelle about our appetizer to see if any recent changes had been made to the menu or prep and she immediately informed Chris of our tossed feelings toward it... Chris then re-visited our table apologized and brought us out desert on the house. Now this is important for everyone to know, one of the prime reasons we choose Roy's for our very special occasions is because we know we will never be disappointed; just as this case proves! Chris and our waitress went above and beyond to make sure we were not only 100% happy with our meal and visit but 110%! Chris brought our three deserts for us not just one. With this he brought out something new, chocolate doughnut holes! I always order the chocolate souffl\u00e9 however if Chocolate doughnut holes are on the menu I will be sure to order it again! It was wonderful to my taste buds, just fantastic. \nAgain, this restaurant and its employees did a wonderful job and my husband and I will be sure to go back!",4
review_79680,others,"Very disappointed. Was quoted double the price for what several other garages charged for the very same service!

Add that to great happy hour specials and you've got a night out on a budget!\n\nI started with the lemonade while everyone else had a beer, and my husband was happy to see the Dogfish 90 minute on the menu. \n\nFor dinner, I went with the greek salad with a side of sweet potato fries (of course!).  The greek salad was huge and came with some pita bread, so this was definitely a great choice for an entree.  The sweet potato fries were delicious, but I was not a fan of the yellow dipping sauce they came with.  What even was that?  No one could figure it out.  The boys loved their burgers and fries.  Definitely big portions!  \n\nOur service was so-so, but nobody seemed to mind.  It allowed us plenty of time to chat and just relax, which was nice.  \n\nI wish there were more choices like this in Chandler!  Until then, we'll definitely take the trek back to the Vig, especially when it gets cooler and we can take advantage of the patio.",3
review_91649,restaurant,"Met Hubby here today for one of our last lunches together for the summer. It's the place he (and just about every other state employee, it seems) eats most often. It's a tiny little shop with a few tables crammed in and a mistered patio out back. The walls are lined with AZ memorabilia, license plates, and old timey signs. But for once, they're for real, not the fake old timey stuff that's on the walls of most chain restaurants. I'm lookin' at you, Cracker Barrel....\n\nThey have a great variety of subs, plus soups, salads, fruit bowls, a veritable wall o'chips, and baskets of sweet snax. Get the Rice Krispie treat. You know you wanna. The subs were quite good- and huge. Had I known how big, I would absolutely have ordered a half. Tons of fresh veggies, lite on the mayo, a tad heavy on the dressing. Dallas is right- the ice is awesome. It's the perfect crush, so that, according to my husband, he can keep on chewing it long after he gets back to his desk and NOT annoy the crap out of his fellow cubies.",3

review_585748,restaurant,"Oh Ramsay we expected the best burger we'd ever had, but honestly we've had plenty better burgers out there at far cheaper prices and without the long one hour wait (longer for bigger parties like ours).\n\nThe burgers themselves were just slightly underseasoned, not enough to complain, but not enough to really bring the flavor.  The buns used were too tall making it difficult to eat, and I wasn't a fan of the balance of the burger either.  I had the farm burger (16) and the white truffle fries (11) and a soda (4).  The fries were decent, much better than the plain fries, while the sweet potato fries were a bit too sweet really.  The fries are advertised as big enough to share, but honestly we had a table of 9 people who don't eat that much and we really needed 6 because we finished 5 sets without wasting a breath.  If you have a reasonable appetite you might want to order one just for yourself.\n\nSo yeah not a bad burger, but for $31 + tax + tip for a burger/fries/soda combo I'd expect much better.  On the plus side the service was some of the best we've had.",2

The pizza came out of the kitchen hot. The crust was thin, chewy and crispy on the edges. \nI really like this place because it's a no-frills pizza place that uses fresh ingredients. I also like it because it's family-owned and operated...so tired of huge chain places, you know?\nI grabbed a magnet (which boasts delivery service, heck yes!) and a to-go menu on my way out the door.

review_170635,others,"Oh the Luxor.....\nLast August my four girlfriends and I went on an extravagant and very memorable Vegas trip.  Our 5 day. 4 night trip was through this fantastic package deal which included day and night activities and accommodations at the Palazzo (a newer and fabulous hotel that is connected to the Venetian and I would highly recommend).  \n\nUnfortunately, two of my girlfriends had procrastinated on booking their flights to Vegas until a few weeks before and with all of the popular airlines prices having skyrocketed, they found themselves drawn to the seemingly good deals of the underwhelming Stockton Airport's lone airline \""Allegiant\"" which offers sporadic flights to Vegas for roughly $50 in planes the size of crop dusters.  The catch- they would have to stay an extra night in Vegas to catch a flight out.  In a further attempt to save money, the two lovable procrastinators decided to find a cheap hotel to rest their hungover heads in for their extra night in Vegas.....in comes the Luxor.  \n\nMy little procrastinators were pretty proud of themselves for figuring out how to save their pennies right up until the point that my non-procrastinator friend and I walked them into the Lobby and helped them settle into their evening at the hotel before thankfully taking our plane home.  The Luxor reminds me of of cheap vodka- take Svedka for example.  Sure, from the outside it looks just as good as all the other vodkas.  It's in a glass bottled (not plastic!), it seems to have it's own character and vibe going on, it's clear ...but once you open the bottle and experience what's inside you realize it's just crap and you feel like a total creep for buying into it.  That, my friends, is the  experience of staying at the Luxor.  \n\nOnce inside, you feel like you're on a ride at Disneyland as the Luxor is something of a cross between \""Mr. Toad's Wild Adventure\"" and \""The Tower of Terror\"".  Almost everyone staying at the Luxor is really foreign or just really trashy.  The entire decor is plastic, artificial, or falling apart.  Between the pom trees and the giant plaster of paris Sphinx in the center of the lobby, it's almost like the haggard hotel is pathetically begging you to believe, \""No this is not a shit hotel, You're in EGYPTTTTT\"". \n\nBut on to the best part....on the way up to the elevator, the elevator attendant (were I use the word creepy to describe him, it wouldn't be fitting enough.  Let's just say if he had been missing an arm and been a ghost, I would have believed it), clad in a faded, teal bellhop suit asked us which floor.  When we replied \""35\"", he replied dryly, \""we've had a lot of jumpers from that floor\"".  Aghast, we asked him how many people have jumped and he said, \""7 so far this summer\"".  When the elevator doors opened and we saw the accommodations, we realized why.  \n\nNot only are the rooms a shabby disgrace, (my girlfriend later confessed to me that she slept with her sweats with her hood over her head and her socks tucked into the bottom of her pants), but the pyramid shape of the building makes walking down the hall extremely dangerous as the overlook from your floor to the lobby is only about waist-high and after a night of drinking could be difficult NOT to tip over off of.  I began to wonder if those jumpers had actually meant to jump, or had simply toppled over the wall.  \n\nIn the end, my non-Luxor patron friend and I joyfully skipped off to grab our flight leaving our poor procrastinator friends to think about their folly.  We were gracious enough however to leave our laughter and \""told you so's\"" until they got home.  No need to kick someone when they're down.  The moral of the story- stay away from the Luxor",0

review_547157,entertainment,"I won tickets to this event and so of course it was all the more enjoyable since my hubby and I got in for free.  But really, it was a lot of fun.  At Steele Indian School Park on a sunny spring day, when we arrived we were told at the gate that the event was sold out.  Since we had our tickets already we still got in (and fortunately found a great parking spot).  I was really happy that they had capped the number of people and started turning folks away instead of just trying to sell more tickets since sometimes events of this type get way too crowded and so they are just not fun.\n\nThe food choices were not that great and as others have mentioned the lines were long.  Waiting in line for 30+ minutes for a plain cold hot dog was not fun.  They did have free water but not much and it was warm.  Shade and seating were severely lacking as well.\n\nBut the beer, oh, the beer!  I wish that all the breweries had cards or something with their name on it to hand out because there were a lot of great craft brews that I had never even heard of and now I totally don't remember their names.  Fan favorites were Left Hand Brewing Co. and New Belgium but since this was STRONG beer festival, they brought along some of their lesser known options that had 6% alcohol content or more.  Local favorites Four Peaks, Barrio, Sleepy Dog, and of course San Tan (winter warmer rocks!) were all there so that was fun.  Throughout the afternoon I tried some beers I liked and some I didn't but it was fun chatting with the brewers and also other festival goers and getting recommendations to suit my preference.  This place was heavy on the IPA offerings but I found a few new stouts and porters that I really liked.\n\nReally friendly, casual, laid back event with great people and great beer.

Fries were ordered for the table. They were delicious, both the sweet potato and regular fries were golden, crispy and hot. I tasted someone's onion rings which were very good. \n\nOne of the dipping sauces served with the fries was a sweet sauce that is a cross between BBQ sauce and ketchup. It was the best part of my meal! Some in our party ordered cups of chili. Their cup size is very large.\n\nI ordered the fish tacos. Big mistake!  The fish was on a nondescript, limp flour tortilla, on a few pieces of shredded, wilted lettuce. I wonder who told the chef that wasabi should go on fish tacos? The fish, although battered and fried adequately, was unseasoned. I thought maybe they didn't season it because it was on a fish taco so I tried someone's fish from their fish and chips order. That fish was also unseasoned and tasteless. \n\nAlso the staff seemed to be having problems taking our orders in a timely manner.

About 8 rooms we had all together. In the morning I stummbled out of my room to ask the front desk for MATCHES so I could have a cigarette outside. Next thing I know the security man grabs me starts to man handle me and pushes me outside. Says I'm kicked out and that he's calling the police...BECAUSE I LEFT MY ROOM? I'm five foot one and petite, wearing jeans and a tshirt, IN NO WAY WAS I THREATNING LOOKING OR LOOKED LIKE A PROSTITUE. so at this point I'm getting scared, call my son at home and tell him to call 911 because I'm being harassed and pushed around by the security for no reason. I have never been treated like that in my life. Finally my son gets ahold of my friends who are upstairs sleeping, and they come down and save me, we leave.

review_26224,housing,"This place is great!!  Clean, modern and well maintained.  The entire staff is responsive, friendly, courteous and accommodating which make this the ideal storage facility for my household overflow of items.  I've been renting multiple spaces for the past year and am completely satisfied with their service.",4
review_216346,restaurant,Man I wish I would not have told the waiter spice was okay. My Alaska Chowder was really good but it was too spicy for me. You can't unspice it. ...The seafood was hearty and fresh. I love that they are open 24 hours!! I ate there after Marquee on a Monday night (Tuesday morning at like 3:30 am).,2
review_445656,shopping,"This Whole Foods was a bit smaller than the one on Charleston. I brought my laptop to use after I had lunch and  It took a little while for the wi-fi to connect, but that could have been my laptop.\n\nThey did have a deli, with most of the types of foods that Whole Foods are known for. I did notice the people were really nice and helpful, so that's a plus.  \n\nThe selection here is not as vast as the Whole Foods on Charleston, it's just a smaller store, but it still a good place to pick up healthy snack and such.",3
review_530720,restaurant,"Highly Overrated!!  If you are asking if it's the best Chinese in the immediate surrounding area...then yes, it's the best Chinese food. Sure, it's better than Wangs, and the place over in the Kyrene and Ray strip mall but it's not better than Gold Chef. \n\nFor one thing, the spring rolls are reheated frozen spring rolls; it's obvious! Pretty bush league if you ask me...especially for a restaurant that people are giving 5 stars to; they were mushy and cold as if they were reheated. There are no egg rolls on the menu and while some of you may respond by saying it's not a Cantonese restaurant...my response to that is...they offer other Cantonese items so why didn't you offer egg rolls too. I know a frozen spring roll like the back of my hand. The food also lacks seasoning. The flavors are good but it could be better. For a Szechwan restaurant, the food was lacking in heat and flavor. While it's good, it's also underseasoned. The fried rice is lacking flavor. When my wife had to apply Sriracha to her Szechwan style Chinese food...that's a bad sign!\n\nBut I will say this dishes are prepared well. You don't see any of the pale watery chicken dishes that you observe at most other \""good Chinese restaurants\"" that you witness in the Valley. If you live in the immediate area, you will not be disappointed getting carry out but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here.",2
review_354302,shopping,"Wow!!! After seeing the great reviews for how well-stocked this place is I walked in and was surprised at how small it was since I was under the impression it would be bigger. But it didn't matter, the stock was just as excellent as I'd been led to believe.\n\nImmediately to the right of the entrance there are Asian specialty foods. Good basics such as soy sauces, sambal oelek, chutneys and many varieties of pastes for all kinds of sauces from Thai to Chinese to Malaysian. A bit further on you'll see mostly Spanish (as in Spain) foods. \n\nDozens of hot sauces, many varieties of dried chillies, salsas, and several Mexican ingredients I've had a hard time finding elsewhere such as huitlacoche (corn smut/fungus, but it's absolutely delicious, especially in a quesadilla!) and large cans of posole/hominy. \n\nThere is a decent selection of some American foods such as pancake mix, canned pumpkin, cake mix and peanut butters. Canadian maple syrup too. I was hoping they would stock iced tea for drinks but didn't see any on my visit. \n\nThere's also a small section of Jamaican and other Caribbean foods, not just hot sauces. \n\nThe refrigerated case by the till offers chorizo, various Mexican cheeses (I didn't see any cotija on this visit but I'll be on the lookout), some really delicious looking fresh salsa and guacamole (a mum and daughter got some along with a bag of the excellent tortilla chips to share).\n\nThe freezer by the entrance offers pre-made burritos, ribs, frozen tortillas.\n\nYes, prices are a bit high generally since nearly everything is imported but for the most part they're fair especially considering the quality and selection. Service was super-helpful in recommending hot sauces and the right type of chilli powder for what we were looking to use it.\n\nWe didn't get as much as we would've liked because we had to carry it back a bit of a ways and the visit was sort of spontaneous, but it's a place I'll definitely return to.",3
review_26968,shopping,"I've been meaning to go in this place for months. And me, being the book fanatic that I am had to at least browse their selection...\n\nSo, took a drive there. It's only like three minutes from my house too, woohoo! Didn't like how 1/3 of the shelves were stacked with sci-fi. (Not my thing) Also didn't like how Fiction was narrowed down to only two shelves. What I did like were the sporadic and odd books I found. Picked up one satire type making fun of Mao Zedong, and Crime & Punishment for about 10 bucks in total. Sweet prices, but I'd take what Jason B. has to say about their cheap prices...haven't really traded any books here but I wouldn't anyway seeing as I love having books all over my house, ha. Either way, employees were alright and this places was decent. Location is also a plus!",2
review_319384,restaurant,"I got the chicken and dumplings with fried okra. The okra was okay, but the chicken and dumplings were really bland. It was super busy, so with that taken into consideration the service was adequate.",2
review_160418,housing,Took 40 minutes at check-in and we couldn't even get the fountain room we booked. So mad! We will NEVER stay here again!,1
review_555790,restaurant,Amazing food! Strange location with just enough ambiance to feel like it's worth the prices. Our server was knowledgable and friendly though she could have been a bit more proactive in making recommendations to some people who were clearly in over their head. I loved everything I had but the pork belly and crispy pig's ears stand out as clear favorites. I wish I was rich so that I could dine here regularly!,4

review_37744,shopping,"This location of TJ Maxx is pretty nice. It is organized well and easy to find what you are looking for. On my recent visit I was able to find a couple of really nice tops at good prices. I have not had very good luck here on other occasions but like others have said, it can be hit or miss. The home department is a little scattered but it is still shoppable. The customer service here is okay, but if you are looking for someone to ask a question, you will not be able to find someone unless you go to the front. \n\nOverall TJ Maxx is a decent store with good deals. I will shop here on occasion.",2
review_101490,drinks,"I have been to this location and the City North location on multiple occasions. We really like the happy hour deals. My boyfriend and I went on a double date the other night and sat on the patio. The server did not seem like he was happy to be there. During our meal we decided that we should leave quickly, not because of the service, but becuase there was an employee (probably off the clock) sitting at the table next to us smoking. The smoke was blowing right into my face and as a non-smoker, I could not stand it.",2
review_422783,drinks,"I was definitely expecting a beautiful bar being that's it's inside the Aria but it wasn't anything special. Service was pretty quick at introducing themselves and taking our order. We had to seat on these lounge chairs that after a while were uncomfortable and I kept sliding down. Seating at the bar wasn't an option counting that there's only like 10 bar stools. The bar sure is tiny, chairs look hell of uncomfortable and I laugh at the \""full bar\"" because they can't even make a pi\u00f1a colada! Mediocre drinks at $12! I had two Vegas Baby! can't say they were amazing, they tasted like your typical Cosmo. My friend order a San Francisco and couldn't even finish it because it was too strong in the bad way, it tasted like crap despite the nice banana aroma. \n\nAmbience is chill and relaxing but we were stuck next to this poor girl and her horrid date. He couldn't use his indoor voice so we found out that she was mad at him because he bought her an expensive purse, her sister told her all he wanted was to smush; here we spent half an hour hearing this unattractive guy scream about how he enjoys when everything sucks.\n\nLadies: no cute guys worth while, not even the barteners qualify!",1
review_203606,restaurant,"Really great interior decor and beautiful bar. We grabbed seats on the patio, because the weather was beautiful. The wait staff was friendly, and the fresh spring rolls to start were good. Not impressively good, but I just love spring rolls and they satisfied my craving. I ordered the basil tofu with brown rice, which was not what I imagined it would be. It almost had a tomato-sauce taste and I really couldn't taste the basil, but there were tons of fresh veggies and the tofu was cooked well. It also wasn't heavy and greasy, which I like. Our food came quickly and was hot. I definitely had Thai on the mind and unfortunately Sun Penang didn't deliver killer Thai, but Thai is not their specialty.  The menu is more Chinese than anything. I'm not cutting them down in any way, because they have a good thing going, it just won't be my go-to for Thai.",2
